22/06/17, 21:30 - Juancho: Alright
22/06/17, 21:30 - Juancho: I noticed something
22/06/17, 21:31 - Juancho: If you place your phone so that the slim side faces you
22/06/17, 21:31 - Juancho: And you throw it upward from said position
22/06/17, 21:32 - Juancho: It has spin
22/06/17, 21:32 - Juancho: And land nicely into your hand
22/06/17, 21:32 - Juancho: But
22/06/17, 21:33 - Juancho: If you place your phone flat on your palm and throw it upward
22/06/17, 21:33 - Juancho: It will not spin on a single axis
22/06/17, 21:34 - Juancho: But instead will be flip flopping between axis
22/06/17, 21:36 - Juancho: I think it's a result of the position of it's center of gravity

23/06/17, 18:48 - Lulu: Who said I was living safe? Lol
23/06/17, 18:48 - Amin: Failiure is needed

23/06/17, 18:50 - Amin: Every body fails
23/06/17, 18:51 - Juancho: It's living with a significant amount of boundaries and rules that suffocates me

23/06/17, 19:11 - Juancho: Btw @554691068741 I started reading "Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman". It's great. I read the part in which he elaborated on his trip to Brazil.
23/06/17, 19:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Anyone know what language this is
23/06/17, 19:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
23/06/17, 19:25 - Didier: Intuitive types are more into mbti.INFP has the most members online,followed by INTP
23/06/17, 19:26 - Didier: Agree
23/06/17, 19:28 - Didier: Same,I can nvr understand why people smoke.I can't even get nesr that thing
23/06/17, 19:28 - Didier: near*
23/06/17, 19:29 - Lulu: When my friends and I took the test all the same. Two of them got infp
23/06/17, 19:30 - Lulu: I forget what the rest got, those two only stuck in my head because they were the same and close to intp
23/06/17, 19:30 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: I know two infp
23/06/17, 19:30 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: One of them was one of my best friends
23/06/17, 19:31 - Didier: Many tests r unreliable.I suggest the best is self-exploration haha.
23/06/17, 19:32 - Didier: I'm an INFP actually
23/06/17, 19:32 - Didier: My thinking function is quite strong as well
23/06/17, 19:32 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Once i was typed as an infp
23/06/17, 19:33 - Lulu: I just too like 3 different ones over the course of a year here and again, I got the same thing each time
23/06/17, 19:33 - Didier: I also took those left and right brain tests and all of them either said I use both equally or the right one more.I think they r related to why I can be an INFP or INTP
23/06/17, 19:33 - Didier: INFP is dominant though
23/06/17, 19:33 - Lulu: Although I think my feeling function is also strong
23/06/17, 19:33 - Didier: How was it in the end?
23/06/17, 19:33 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
23/06/17, 19:34 - Didier: I noticed INFPs r really nice ppl in general.The longest best friends I have are INFJ and INFP

23/06/17, 20:00 - Maureen: german is a lot of logic but until you find out that logic it may be too late for some motivation
23/06/17, 20:01 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: I want to learn another language but my english isn't perfect so i don't know if i should
23/06/17, 20:01 - Maureen: do it!
23/06/17, 20:01 - Maureen: but don't chose a language that's too close to a language you already know
23/06/17, 20:02 - Maureen: I tried to learn Portuguese but it was too close to spanish
23/06/17, 20:02 - Maureen: and then I tried Dutch. same... too close to german

23/06/17, 20:03 - Maureen: german language but away enough to differentiate to german
23/06/17, 20:04 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: I was thinking about learning french

24/06/17, 12:02 - Lulu: I'm so bored lately lol
24/06/17, 12:03 - Lulu: I'm full of energy and potential to do something more than lay around all day yet that's what I do as if I'm tired
24/06/17, 12:03 - Arne: Go read a book?
24/06/17, 12:04 - Lulu: Requires a walk to the library which includes possible social interaction and plans with a certain person who always noodles her way into hanging out w me
24/06/17, 12:05 - Lulu: I'll probably go to the library in due time tbh
24/06/17, 12:05 - Lulu: I just found my card afterall
24/06/17, 12:06 - Lulu: Like books in stores gotta be 10-20 bucks each and I only get paid like 100 every two weeks
24/06/17, 12:06 - Lulu: Lol
24/06/17, 12:07 - Lulu: Minus certain expenses
24/06/17, 12:07 - Lulu: Ah the life of a part timer teenager
24/06/17, 12:07 - Arne: When I go to the library, there is no one to talk with.
24/06/17, 12:07 - Lulu: Buying online or pdfs are always an option
24/06/17, 12:08 - Arne: And the library has ebooks.
24/06/17, 12:08 - Lulu: See I know someone who I went to school with who I kinda stopped hanging and being friends with for reasons, we are still on good terms and whenever she sees me she tries to make plabs
24/06/17, 12:08 - Lulu: Mine doesn't
24/06/17, 12:08 - Arne: Oh that's shitty
24/06/17, 12:09 - Lulu: It actually has a pretty small selection too, one of those close knit smells like a homey library library
24/06/17, 12:09 - Lulu: Which is nice in a way
24/06/17, 12:09 - Lulu: I always try to go help set up for their book sales when I see the banner there tho
24/06/17, 12:10 - Lulu: It's mostly nice older people running it
24/06/17, 12:10 - Arne: Indeed
24/06/17, 12:11 - Arne: We had first off a big library, but they moved to a smaller one.
24/06/17, 12:13 - Lulu: I only ever went to it for summer reading books TBH for school
24/06/17, 12:13 - Lulu: Sometimes I'd find other stuff I like tho
24/06/17, 12:15 - Arne: Oh
24/06/17, 12:16 - Arne: Always when summer vacation is near, I try to get enough books at home to don't get boring
24/06/17, 12:17 - Lulu: I mean the thing is mentally I'm pretty good
24/06/17, 12:17 - Lulu: But my body craves some sort of physical activity
24/06/17, 12:17 - Lulu: From being a couch potato
24/06/17, 12:19 - Lulu: Or at least some sun but like, effort?
24/06/17, 12:20 - Lulu: I go to work later today though soooo I get a good walk
24/06/17, 12:22 - Arne: Okay
24/06/17, 12:23 - Arne: I have that all the time, lucky for me I play football
24/06/17, 12:24 - Didier: Oh my goodness.I just realised my book is due ._.

24/06/17, 12:24 - Didier: Have to read it later then
24/06/17, 12:25 - Lulu: I also don't have much of a desire to eat lately either? Like I still do but
24/06/17, 12:25 - Didier: Thanks for reminding me 😂
24/06/17, 12:25 - Lulu: I just don't feel like really doing anything productive
24/06/17, 12:25 - Lulu: No problem lol
24/06/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Something else today woulds guaranteed jogged ur memory tho probably
24/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: Have u thought of the reason why?
24/06/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Ah that sentence was so backwards 😭
24/06/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Lethargy
24/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: Yep shud be it
24/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: Make sure ur well rested

24/06/17, 12:27 - Lulu: Probably the wrong word
24/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: Rest in whatever way helps u haha
24/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: For some ppl it's mental energy

24/06/17, 12:29 - Didier: They make me not think as much as usual
24/06/17, 12:29 - Didier: It was crazy,I was sweating playing games haha
24/06/17, 12:30 - Lulu: I mean from what o remember the beginnings of my summer are always like this but I always thought it was due to my depression before dwelling on how worthless I am and how much of q flop of a school year I had, or maybe I'm just caught in a familiar loop who knows lol
24/06/17, 12:30 - Lulu: Hmm sensors:
24/06/17, 12:30 - Lulu: ?
24/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: Like,they live in the here and now?
24/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: They just have fun
24/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: xSxx
24/06/17, 12:31 - Lulu: Ohhh
24/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: Seasonal depression maybe?
24/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: Depression has an effect on appetite
24/06/17, 12:32 - Lulu: See my seasonal depression usually kicks in around January to the end of the Cold months though
24/06/17, 12:32 - Lulu: I don't particularly feel depressed?
24/06/17, 12:32 - Didier: Haha I would have to do more research on that to help u
24/06/17, 12:32 - Didier: Have u found sth that helps u?
24/06/17, 12:33 - Lulu: Sth?
24/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: That would be how long
24/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: Something
24/06/17, 12:34 - Lulu: Like January to maybe April or sooner depending when winter stops wintering
24/06/17, 12:34 - Lulu: I meann
24/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: We don't have the four seasons here so wouldn't be able to understand 😂
24/06/17, 12:34 - Lulu: I feel like I'm just kinda here
24/06/17, 12:34 - Lulu: Loll
24/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: Oh,so it's during winter
24/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: Do u know why it affects u?
24/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: The environment or whatever
24/06/17, 12:35 - Maureen: winter depression is common because of the lack of sun
24/06/17, 12:35 - Maureen: it's vitamin d deficiency
24/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: Oh yes
24/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: Forgot to mention that
24/06/17, 12:35 - Lulu: Yeah I was gonna say, most likely sun and also just that stuck in a familiar loop thing
24/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: Hmm,I'll see how to help u later haha
24/06/17, 12:36 - Lulu: I felt nothing for like 3 Christmases and new year's and a row lol
24/06/17, 12:36 - Didier: It's an empty feeling?
24/06/17, 12:36 - Lulu: This year was the first I started feeling again rly
24/06/17, 12:36 - Didier: Is it possible to find a distraction?

24/06/17, 12:37 - Lulu: I have no particular goals
24/06/17, 12:37 - Didier: Maybe it's because u r not seeing the light?I know some ppl like that
24/06/17, 12:37 - Didier: Maybe u should get near to a light source haha
24/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: And get cosy?
24/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: Same as me.No worries
24/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: It's because there r so many possible destinations out there
24/06/17, 12:38 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
24/06/17, 12:39 - Didier: Nice place,better than mine 😂

24/06/17, 12:39 - Didier: If u get easily distracted,that's even better
24/06/17, 12:40 - Lulu: Small but we don't take up much space 😌

24/06/17, 12:42 - Lulu: 😎😎😎
24/06/17, 12:42 - Lulu: Ima keep talking a bit here to myself explaining further so don't feel the need to reply if ur busy lol
24/06/17, 12:48 - Lulu: My mind and body both feel averagely well, getting plenty of sleep and such, I have been reading manga and comics for a while, and have been shipping my ships too hard, just kinda lazying doing nothing and resting well and that's fun and all but it's starting to get boring I guess and I don't have many other outlets, me and my friend need to schedule days to hang out because we both work and it depends on the day we get payed as well if we wanna go out to do shit or just stay home, so I'm just chilling with my cats, going to work, waiting for season 3 of voltron legendary defenders and procrastinating on getting myself prepared and put together for college or to be a functioning adult
24/06/17, 12:48 - Lulu: Something I know I need to do and have been meaning to do is write important passwords and accounts in a notebook because I don't need to be forgetting shit like that and I need to stop making everything I have the same three passwords lol
24/06/17, 12:50 - Lulu: And I'm also home alone most days because everyone else works
24/06/17, 12:50 - Lulu: I pretty much only have an inclination ATM to do my laundry and sometimes cook a healthy meal for myself
24/06/17, 12:51 - Lulu: For whatever reason I started binge eating a few days ago, even when I didn't want to I'd keep going so I'm just kinda like fuck this
24/06/17, 12:51 - Lulu: I'm controlling it more now, I need to get control of it before I develop a problem forlol
24/06/17, 12:51 - Lulu: Lol*
24/06/17, 12:52 - Lulu: So instead of eating three apples and two bananas last night I just took the two bananas
24/06/17, 12:54 - Lulu: My eating problems aren't really as bad as they sound
24/06/17, 12:54 - Lulu: I just like to eat healthier these days and I'm a bit lazy sometimes to make myself food
24/06/17, 12:54 - Arne: Go every week to a sunbank thing
24/06/17, 12:55 - Lulu: I had pre prepared myself meals at a point but when those ran out I kinda had no desire to cook or eat lol
24/06/17, 12:56 - Arne: I don't drink cola anymore at home, only at parties
24/06/17, 12:56 - Lulu: I think the whole base of this is rly me being a lazy procrastinator
24/06/17, 12:57 - Lulu: If I'm at a party ill typically try to still find water
24/06/17, 12:57 - Lulu: I'll crave a soda every once in a rare while
24/06/17, 12:58 - Arne: Good habit
24/06/17, 12:59 - Lulu: I made my mom get off soda, I'm proud of her she really cut back on it
24/06/17, 12:59 - Lulu: My dad too
24/06/17, 13:00 - Lulu: They use to buy soda a lot and my and my brother would complain and nag them
24/06/17, 13:00 - Lulu: Me and my brother*
24/06/17, 13:02 - Lulu: Me and my friends have a joke that I'm a tree because I drink lots of water and I'm taller than them
24/06/17, 13:41 - Didier: Same haha
24/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: 😂 I like ur friends
24/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: I had the desire to eat but no desire to cook tho^
24/06/17, 15:44 - Juancho: We never did get to debate abortion
24/06/17, 15:44 - Juancho: Perhaps we could do it now
24/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: just do it
24/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: hahahaha
24/06/17, 15:54 - FABIO: i really dont see how can discuss abortion
24/06/17, 15:54 - Arne: Indeed
24/06/17, 15:54 - FABIO: there is a reason not to?? besides the religion bullshit?
24/06/17, 15:56 - Juancho: You mean besides being outright retarded and unreasonable?
24/06/17, 15:56 - FABIO: yeah
24/06/17, 15:57 - FABIO: oh a fetus is a life.. you cant kill it
24/06/17, 15:57 - Juancho: Hahaha
24/06/17, 15:57 - FABIO: bitch please
24/06/17, 15:57 - Juancho: I have had this debate about 2 or 3 times
24/06/17, 15:57 - Juancho: Now
24/06/17, 15:57 - Arne: As long as the girl is healthy minded, I don't care if she does abortion
24/06/17, 15:57 - FABIO: god forbid it
24/06/17, 15:57 - Juancho: I just drafted all the counterarguments to any possible argument made by pro life people in a google doc
24/06/17, 15:57 - Juancho: And show it to them
24/06/17, 15:58 - FABIO: pro life
24/06/17, 15:58 - FABIO: MY
24/06/17, 15:58 - FABIO: FUCKING ASS
24/06/17, 15:58 - Juancho: Instead of having hem ramble on for hours on end
24/06/17, 15:58 - FABIO: they do not adopt... they do not feed homeless children
24/06/17, 15:58 - Juancho: Ahahaha.
24/06/17, 15:58 - FABIO: they can tottally go. fuck off
24/06/17, 15:59 - FABIO: i really dont know how they can be this retarded
24/06/17, 16:00 - Juancho: When the woman pregnant there's all these institutions convincing her and telling her not to abort. She doesn't, but afterwards i don't see any of the pro life people paying the child welfare money and making sure that the woman has a job
24/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: exactly
24/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: they just dont wanna let her avoid it..
24/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: they cant accept that she had sex.. and dont wanna the little bastard
24/06/17, 16:00 - Juancho: Beats the hell out me. Unless they are willing to take care of the child for at least 18 years. They can fuck off.
24/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: i have a girlfriend.. me and she dont wanna a children for at least when we are with 30 or 40 years old
24/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: so fuck off... if it happen.. tottally will abort
24/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: hahahaha
24/06/17, 16:05 - FABIO: euthanasia
24/06/17, 16:05 - FABIO: is another fucked up topic for this retarded moralist people
24/06/17, 16:11 - Lulu: Then there are those who are just straight up against contraception lol
24/06/17, 16:11 - Lulu: TBH IDK if I'd wanna have kids of my own
24/06/17, 16:11 - Lulu: I kinda just wanna become well established and help foster kids along their way
24/06/17, 16:12 - FABIO: i wanna someone carying my genes
24/06/17, 16:12 - FABIO: but way later in life
24/06/17, 16:13 - FABIO: not now

24/06/17, 16:13 - Lulu: Man*
24/06/17, 16:13 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Lol
24/06/17, 16:13 - FABIO: i am a man

24/06/17, 16:13 - FABIO: hahahahha
24/06/17, 16:13 - Lulu: The possibility of c section
24/06/17, 16:14 - Lulu: The possibility of your genitals spitting
24/06/17, 16:14 - FABIO: from my point of view... its really easy
24/06/17, 16:14 - Lulu: Lol
24/06/17, 16:14 - Lulu: The complications that could arise
24/06/17, 16:14 - Lulu: Mental and physically changed forever
24/06/17, 16:14 - Lulu: Lol
24/06/17, 16:15 - Lulu: I mean mentally for some
24/06/17, 16:15 - FABIO: change is good
24/06/17, 16:15 - FABIO: and physically? dont know
24/06/17, 16:15 - Lulu: Not like the mother intuition bs
24/06/17, 16:15 - Lulu: Like the hormones mentally changing you
24/06/17, 16:16 - FABIO: yeah
24/06/17, 16:16 - FABIO: its good
24/06/17, 16:16 - FABIO: change is always good
24/06/17, 16:16 - Lulu: Postpartum depression isn't good lol
24/06/17, 16:24 - Lulu: TBH if I wanted to I'm sure I could but I don't personally find the appeal in having children great enough for the sacrifice
24/06/17, 16:24 - Lulu: And the unpredictability of various complications
24/06/17, 16:29 - Lulu: I'd just rather spend my life trying to help multiple children who were dealt a bad hand in life rather than dedicating all my time and money and physicality into 2 or 3, not that there's anything wrong with it of course
24/06/17, 16:46 - FABIO: @50494800614 that guys

24/06/17, 17:11 - Maureen: Btw who pays for the pill? condoms are given for free
24/06/17, 17:12 - Maureen: Because why wearing a west against bullets when you can avoid the shooting?!
24/06/17, 17:13 - Juancho: Good point
24/06/17, 17:22 - Arne: There is a change of like 10% that it goes wrong with condoms.
24/06/17, 17:22 - Maureen: who says the pill is safer?
24/06/17, 17:23 - Arne: I dobt
24/06/17, 17:23 - Maureen: there's no 100% chance of safety
24/06/17, 17:23 - Arne: I just say the fact about condoms
24/06/17, 17:23 - Maureen: okay 🙂
24/06/17, 17:23 - FABIO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LDuATLcqLQ

24/06/17, 17:23 - FABIO: be this amazing
24/06/17, 17:24 - Lulu: Pills are either payed out of pocket or by insurance
24/06/17, 17:24 - Lulu: I think?
24/06/17, 17:24 - Lulu: The pill isn't effective for all though, like some can't take it because it causes bad side effects
24/06/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Even with the pill protection should still be used tho
24/06/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Unless it's a partner u know about
24/06/17, 17:27 - Lulu: U don't know what kinda shit people have lol
24/06/17, 17:47 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
24/06/17, 17:47 - Arne: Lmao
24/06/17, 17:48 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The pills is just hormones
24/06/17, 17:59 - Maureen: hormones have effects on the body...
24/06/17, 17:59 - Maureen: the pill tells the body that you're pregnant. so your body reacts like a pregnancy
24/06/17, 18:00 - Maureen: in Germany you have to pay 10€ for one pack
24/06/17, 18:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What kind of pills are you talking about?
24/06/17, 18:00 - Maureen: the pill to avoid pregnancy
24/06/17, 18:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah but what kind of contraceptive pills
24/06/17, 18:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There's progesterone only
24/06/17, 18:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's called mini pills
24/06/17, 18:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Then there's progestin and estrogen
24/06/17, 18:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And the pill you described is neither of these
24/06/17, 18:02 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
24/06/17, 18:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆😆
24/06/17, 18:04 - Arne: Who si that guy btw?
24/06/17, 18:04 - Juancho: Some guy that joined a physics group i have
24/06/17, 18:05 - Arne: Okay
24/06/17, 18:07 - Maureen: estrogen and gestagen
24/06/17, 18:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Why would someone want steroidal contraceptives?
24/06/17, 18:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I mean, a normal someone
24/06/17, 18:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: gestagen doesn't even come in here, that's pretty heavy stuff
24/06/17, 18:10 - Maureen: estrogen prevents ovulation and gestagen thickens cervical mucus
24/06/17, 18:11 - Maureen: Wikipedia says it's normal over here
24/06/17, 18:12 - Maureen: we also have the mini pill
24/06/17, 18:12 - Maureen: I've never taken the pill so I have no idea besides Wikipedia and what I know from sex ed (aka sex ed pages in a teen mag)
24/06/17, 18:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're right
24/06/17, 18:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But the thing is the gestagen binds with some substance and ends up being steroidal
24/06/17, 18:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I forgot what the substance was
24/06/17, 18:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And steroids have unnecessarily abundant side-effects. So a big no
24/06/17, 18:25 - Maureen: is that substance naturally in our body?
24/06/17, 18:26 - Maureen: I mean if it would be that hard then it wouldn't be legal over here
24/06/17, 19:58 - Lulu: There's pizza at work ayy
24/06/17, 20:00 - Lulu: There's also the day after pill IDK what it's made of tho
24/06/17, 20:02 - Lulu: And cakeee
24/06/17, 20:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yes, but it's legal surprisingly
24/06/17, 20:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Are you a she?
24/06/17, 20:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @4915127175996 why does German have big words like "entschuldigung" for small words like "sorry"?
24/06/17, 20:36 - Maureen: because it's a compound 😂
24/06/17, 20:36 - Maureen: Ent-schuldig-ung
24/06/17, 20:37 - Maureen: it basically means "making yourself free from guilt"
24/06/17, 20:37 - Maureen: but we also say "sorry"
24/06/17, 20:37 - Maureen: most of our long words are compounds
24/06/17, 21:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Ohhh
24/06/17, 21:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm still learning 😅
24/06/17, 21:09 - Maureen: do you learn german?
24/06/17, 22:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah
24/06/17, 22:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Im learning German, Russian, French and Spanish. I've done Spanish and French but it's been a while so catching up
24/06/17, 22:51 - Lulu: I am a she
24/06/17, 22:54 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Lord, that's a lot of languages

25/06/17, 05:05 - Lulu: Nooooooo clue
25/06/17, 11:23 - Maureen: guys, I have a constant anxiety since yesterday. my heart is racing, I feel like I'm shaking and can't think about anything other than the amok alarm on Friday...
I usually have agoraphobia which I can live with. 
next week I have to go to a seminar which was a personal compromise with myself. until now. I don't think I can handle the trip.
so should I stay home and work instead?
25/06/17, 11:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I have no idea how you feel, so I can't give advice
25/06/17, 11:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But I want to say face your fears
25/06/17, 11:29 - Maureen: it's like the anxiety you have when you need to make a serious phone call. but constant
25/06/17, 11:29 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Oooh
25/06/17, 11:29 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah, I kniw the feeling
25/06/17, 11:30 - Maureen: worst case: I freak out in the train and have to leave the train. and then I'm somewhere in germany...
25/06/17, 11:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't have that level of fear though
25/06/17, 11:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
25/06/17, 11:31 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: What is an amok alarm?
25/06/17, 11:33 - Maureen: it's the alarm that says a shooter is in the building
25/06/17, 11:33 - Maureen: or a person with a knife
25/06/17, 11:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Damn
25/06/17, 11:33 - Maureen: it was a false alarm but we were on lock down and got evacuated
25/06/17, 11:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Was the alarm at the seminar building?
25/06/17, 11:33 - Maureen: no at work
25/06/17, 11:34 - Maureen: but it triggered my anxiety
25/06/17, 11:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Then take a day off
25/06/17, 11:34 - Maureen: I work in a school btw
25/06/17, 11:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Forcing yourself is useless if you can't function properly due to anxiety
25/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But try to go to the seminar
25/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Oh wait
25/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I misunderstood
25/06/17, 11:35 - Maureen: no way. we all have to talk about it on Monday.  we have to talk to the kids and to each other. it actually helps.
I saw a kid yesterday and talking with her about it was giving me some relief
25/06/17, 11:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I thought that you disn't want to go to work
25/06/17, 11:36 - Maureen: no, the seminar
25/06/17, 11:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
25/06/17, 11:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Stay home then
25/06/17, 11:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Try to find another seminar
25/06/17, 11:38 - Maureen: when I hand in a doctors note then I don't need another seminar
25/06/17, 11:38 - Maureen: and I definitely get a doctors note
25/06/17, 11:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
25/06/17, 11:38 - Maureen: thank you ❤

25/06/17, 11:39 - Maureen: I was really looking forward to the trip because it's in Cologne and it's pride week then...
25/06/17, 11:40 - Maureen: not the parade tho but I've never seen gay town on pride week
25/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm

25/06/17, 13:46 - Lulu: If you think it will trigger you further I'd say best stay home
25/06/17, 13:46 - Lulu: I'd hope the anxiety would subside by then but IDK how yours works so if ur still on edge by then
25/06/17, 13:46 - Lulu: Probably a no go

But my parents are less intelligent than me.

26/06/17, 15:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Intelligence isn't just knowledge
26/06/17, 15:17 - FABIO: exactly...
26/06/17, 15:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The entire thing about the mbti personality types is that every type excells in a specific field
26/06/17, 15:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We just happen to excell in logic

26/06/17, 15:19 - Maureen: exactly
26/06/17, 15:19 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I didn't put the ' there because I doubt your intelligence
26/06/17, 15:19 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Some people would think that
26/06/17, 15:19 - Maureen: btw do you feel like you have to explain every sentence you say?
26/06/17, 15:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm used to explaining to non-intp who tend to not exami e my sentences
26/06/17, 15:20 - Maureen: like you say something and people think you'd be in the other corner but really you're just pointing out a fact?
26/06/17, 15:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yup
26/06/17, 15:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not fun if someone misunderstands you and then doesn't give you a chance to explain
26/06/17, 15:22 - Maureen: that's why my brother in law and I got into a major fight and didn't talk for month
26/06/17, 15:22 - Maureen: months

26/06/17, 16:45 - Arne: True
26/06/17, 17:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well you're just assuming
26/06/17, 17:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've had a first-hand experience of it and I think pretty good content is shared in the group
26/06/17, 17:40 - Juancho: How would this be possible. It's redundant. Ik my mother is a bit less intelligent than me but then i remember that my dad has an IQ 11 points higher than mine. You just aren't aware of their possible intelligence
26/06/17, 17:40 - Juancho: .
26/06/17, 17:40 - Juancho: Every time.
26/06/17, 17:40 - Juancho: Me neither.
26/06/17, 17:48 - Maureen: another question: how do you handle dating?
26/06/17, 17:48 - Maureen: or getting to know potential dates?

26/06/17, 17:50 - Maureen: but do you go out? or where do you meet new people?
26/06/17, 17:53 - Maureen: I can't handle social contacts and crowded places
26/06/17, 17:54 - FABIO: here i do college. so have college parties
26/06/17, 17:54 - FABIO: we have one.. every semester.. we close a street

26/06/17, 17:58 - FABIO: its an experiencie
26/06/17, 17:58 - Maureen: sometimes flat parties at a friends place
26/06/17, 17:58 - FABIO: a nice one..
26/06/17, 17:58 - FABIO: you have to let go of fears
26/06/17, 17:58 - Maureen: I really don't like crowded places
26/06/17, 17:58 - FABIO: just be yourself... people actually dont hate you...
26/06/17, 17:59 - FABIO: people actually enjoy an smart humour...
26/06/17, 18:00 - Maureen: it's not about people hating me. people love me 😂
but so many people exhaust me. literally
26/06/17, 18:00 - FABIO: oh yes
26/06/17, 18:00 - FABIO: but you can spende 3 hours on it
26/06/17, 18:01 - FABIO: than go home.. alone.. or with 1 or 2... 3 perhaps
26/06/17, 18:01 - FABIO: dependes your tastes...
26/06/17, 18:01 - FABIO: haahahahha
26/06/17, 18:01 - FABIO: then* go home*
26/06/17, 18:01 - Maureen: I was lucky I had friends who had a similar taste of fun: pizza and movies 😂

26/06/17, 18:07 - FABIO: i always found it disgusting.
26/06/17, 18:07 - Maureen: like "do you sleep with men as well? because I have a hot BF..."

26/06/17, 18:33 - ‪+351 961 414 659‬: Maureen it's a boy or girl name? I really don't know.. Not my native language.. If your a boy remember it's important  having female friends (in my opinion).. I think if you only have a gruop of male friends it will be difficult.. And remember attraction it's an illusion game..
26/06/17, 18:36 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I agree on the last part

26/06/17, 19:40 - Juancho: I couldn't possibly answer your question. I'm a bit of simpleton when it come to dating and girls. I've never had a girlfriend. I'm more of the committed relationship type of guy. I'd rather not have a girlfriend unless she is an intellectual and decent looking.
26/06/17, 19:43 - FABIO: Thats becouse you didnt tasted yet

26/06/17, 20:50 - Juancho: Is it just me or are you guys also repelled by fiction books
26/06/17, 20:52 - Juancho: I've always looked the other way when it came to fiction books so I decided to give them a chance
26/06/17, 20:54 - Juancho: I read these: the full harry potter series, al Percy Jackson books, the hobbit series and other series
26/06/17, 20:55 - Juancho: Now I fucking loathe these type of books
26/06/17, 20:55 - Juancho: Please don't put yourself through this agony
26/06/17, 20:55 - Juancho: And stick with non-fiction
26/06/17, 21:11 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: What books do you recommend?

26/06/17, 21:48 - Juancho: I have read books from isabel allende and from gabriel garcia marquez
27/06/17, 00:51 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 03:40 - Didier: Wow...No audio?I'll never be brave enough to do that ._.
27/06/17, 03:41 - Didier: Watching the video alone is scary enough 😂
27/06/17, 03:41 - Juancho: I know. It literally gave me goosebumps.
27/06/17, 03:41 - Didier: I wonder how they do that haha
27/06/17, 03:41 - Juancho: Does this guy have some death wish of sorts?
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: For those scared of heights,that will be...
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: That's what I thought
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: They could have died
27/06/17, 03:42 - FABIO: why tho?
27/06/17, 03:42 - FABIO: they just wanna live
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: No safety precaution?
27/06/17, 03:42 - Juancho: Exactly
27/06/17, 03:42 - FABIO: everyone is going to die.... or are you going to be imortal?
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: Some people like to do these things
27/06/17, 03:42 - Didier: Adrenaline I guess

27/06/17, 03:43 - FABIO: everyone does it
27/06/17, 03:43 - Juancho: Who the fuck walks in the edge of a skyscraper tall thin af structure like you're just taking a stroll at the park
27/06/17, 03:43 - Didier: Die in a mortigying way
27/06/17, 03:43 - FABIO: everyone will do it
27/06/17, 03:43 - FABIO: but living

27/06/17, 03:43 - Juancho: ??

27/06/17, 03:43 - FABIO: you will understand it
27/06/17, 03:43 - FABIO: jack london*
27/06/17, 03:43 - Didier: I will definitely fall down the chimney lol
27/06/17, 03:44 - Juancho: I would at least have taken a parachute
27/06/17, 03:44 - Juancho: What the hell is this guy's problem?
27/06/17, 03:44 - FABIO: you did not brought safety measures for life
27/06/17, 03:44 - FABIO: you do not need it

27/06/17, 03:44 - Didier: I wanna try the parachute next time
27/06/17, 03:44 - FABIO: everyone says its dangerous
27/06/17, 03:44 - FABIO: i think its dangerous
27/06/17, 03:45 - Didier: Not climbing a tall structure for me
27/06/17, 03:45 - FABIO: but the feeling i got.. when i ride this fucker
27/06/17, 03:45 - FABIO: is awesome
27/06/17, 03:45 - Didier: Well if u like it and can then die without regrets,go ahead
27/06/17, 03:45 - Juancho: Fuck that. I'm terrified by heights.
27/06/17, 03:45 - Janith: Where is this Chimney?
27/06/17, 03:45 - Juancho: I will try it eventually though.
27/06/17, 03:45 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 03:45 - Janith: I'd like to climb it if I can
27/06/17, 03:45 - Didier: U mean what they did?
27/06/17, 03:45 - Janith: Me too 😂
27/06/17, 03:45 - Juancho: In the middle of nowhere.

27/06/17, 03:46 - FABIO: its the same thing
27/06/17, 03:46 - FABIO: its the same danger

27/06/17, 03:46 - Didier: Yep
27/06/17, 03:46 - Didier: Just that I dun wanna die in the way they will
27/06/17, 03:47 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 03:47 - Didier: Seems fun.Diff kind of danger
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: you
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: can not fear death
27/06/17, 03:47 - Didier: I wanna try all sorts of things next time
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: death will dont take away anything from you...
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: only you can
27/06/17, 03:47 - Didier: Except for climbing tall structures
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: only you can private you
27/06/17, 03:47 - FABIO: from living
27/06/17, 03:48 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 03:48 - Didier: Yep I know
27/06/17, 03:48 - FABIO: death will not take away anything from you*
27/06/17, 03:48 - Didier: I wanna have all the fun before I die
27/06/17, 03:48 - FABIO: hahaha.. love this one
27/06/17, 03:48 - Didier: Any INTJs here though?
27/06/17, 03:49 - Juancho: Don't think so
27/06/17, 03:49 - Juancho: .
27/06/17, 03:49 - Didier: I had an INTJ friend and yeah she was cold and narcissistic
27/06/17, 03:49 - Didier: Funny thing is she admitted it herself
27/06/17, 03:49 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 03:49 - Juancho: Wtf
27/06/17, 03:49 - Janith: How true do you guys think this is
27/06/17, 03:49 - Juancho: I have an INTJ brother
27/06/17, 03:49 - FABIO: my intj friend.. is a fucking machine
27/06/17, 03:49 - FABIO: the guy dont stop
27/06/17, 03:50 - FABIO: yet
27/06/17, 03:50 - FABIO: he have all the humans ishues
27/06/17, 03:50 - Didier: What kind of machine?
27/06/17, 03:50 - Didier: They have a good sense of humour though I guess
27/06/17, 03:50 - FABIO: sex one
27/06/17, 03:50 - FABIO: haahahahahaha
27/06/17, 03:50 - Didier: Hahah
27/06/17, 03:50 - Juancho: Quite true. As true as saying that liberals are retarded. So 100% accurate.
27/06/17, 03:50 - Janith: INTJ ex. Definitely felt like a robot around her 😂
27/06/17, 03:50 - Didier: Wow
27/06/17, 03:50 - FABIO: you arent liberal?
27/06/17, 03:50 - Juancho: Hahahah
27/06/17, 03:50 - Didier: More so than INTP then?
27/06/17, 03:51 - Juancho: I mean i don't label myself
27/06/17, 03:51 - Juancho: I don't care for political parties
27/06/17, 03:51 - Juancho: I go with what is more rational
27/06/17, 03:51 - Didier: Same
27/06/17, 03:51 - Janith: We need a governance model based on this principle
27/06/17, 03:51 - Didier: I can't trust them politicians though
27/06/17, 03:51 - Didier: Btw guys,
27/06/17, 03:51 - Juancho: Liberals (democrats) are probably the most retarded people i've seen (literally)
27/06/17, 03:52 - Juancho: Hahaha.
27/06/17, 03:52 - Didier: I saw this on pinterest about american presidents mbti
27/06/17, 03:52 - Janith: I don't think politicians are meant to be trusted
27/06/17, 03:52 - Didier: The only slots that r empty r INFP and INTP
27/06/17, 03:52 - Didier: That's why I wanna be one so I can be trusted haha
27/06/17, 03:52 - FABIO: there was one
27/06/17, 03:52 - FABIO: that probably was intp
27/06/17, 03:52 - FABIO: thomas jefferson
27/06/17, 03:52 - Juancho: I hate pintrest. Cheeky cunts
27/06/17, 03:52 - Janith: Lincoln
27/06/17, 03:52 - FABIO: read about hin in an intp book
27/06/17, 03:52 - Didier: Hmm,not sure would have to check
27/06/17, 03:53 - Janith: Lincoln was totally intp
27/06/17, 03:53 - Didier: But INFP and INTP presidents r rare
27/06/17, 03:53 - Didier: Compared to other types
27/06/17, 03:53 - Janith: He was also a vampire hunter
27/06/17, 03:53 - Juancho: He is officially classified as INTP
27/06/17, 03:53 - Didier: We have pur motives I guess
27/06/17, 03:53 - Didier: pure
27/06/17, 03:53 - FABIO: we are just too dumb
27/06/17, 03:53 - FABIO: to understand the world
27/06/17, 03:53 - FABIO: by people ways
27/06/17, 03:54 - FABIO: we understand logic and science
27/06/17, 03:54 - FABIO: not this bullshit
27/06/17, 03:54 - Juancho: For anyone wanting to read, i have about 7 books regarding INTPs and their goals in life and how to be a better INTP
27/06/17, 03:54 - Didier: Not really dumb.More like naive in a way
27/06/17, 03:54 - Juancho: I can send the files
27/06/17, 03:54 - Didier: But naivety can be good in a place like this
27/06/17, 03:54 - Janith: I doubt that. We can understand people but we can't force ourselves to play along with social norms
27/06/17, 03:54 - Didier: Where we need pureness
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: and you dont believe in my
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: when i say
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: this shit
27/06/17, 03:55 - Didier: Well,but must learn how to be smart too,to cope
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: is the same as astrology
27/06/17, 03:55 - Didier: Ikr
27/06/17, 03:55 - Juancho: You can't make a statement like:"they all look alike to me" without being labeled as racist
27/06/17, 03:55 - Janith: Send em, that way anyone here who wants to check them out can
27/06/17, 03:55 - Juancho: Sure
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: no
27/06/17, 03:55 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: it will
27/06/17, 03:55 - FABIO: be bad
27/06/17, 03:55 - Juancho: Later today though
27/06/17, 03:55 - Didier: Really?
27/06/17, 03:56 - FABIO: guys
27/06/17, 03:56 - FABIO: :/
27/06/17, 03:56 - Didier: That's considered racist?
27/06/17, 03:56 - FABIO: you cant be
27/06/17, 03:56 - FABIO: this naive
27/06/17, 03:56 - Juancho: Seriously. It's like walking on a minefield.
27/06/17, 03:56 - Didier: They really don't know what is racism vs perspective/facts
27/06/17, 03:56 - Didier: Yeah that's why I can't stand them
27/06/17, 03:57 - Juancho: I simply don't give af about political correctness. I will get my point across with facts and logic not having to be worried if I will hurt someone's feelings.
27/06/17, 03:58 - Didier: Political correctness?
27/06/17, 03:58 - FABIO: :/
27/06/17, 03:58 - FABIO: untill you meet a girl
27/06/17, 03:58 - FABIO: you like
27/06/17, 03:58 - Didier: I think feelings should be considered but the truth ought to be spoken
27/06/17, 03:59 - Didier: So yep
27/06/17, 03:59 - Didier: If they can't take the truth,
27/06/17, 03:59 - Didier: They have to buck up
27/06/17, 03:59 - Juancho: No man. See that's the thing. I don't want to be smothered by all these things i have to be looking out for when making my statements. That's why i need an intellectual as a partner (and I would love her to be an INTP)
27/06/17, 03:59 - Juancho: Exactly
27/06/17, 03:59 - Didier: Feelings r important,but not to the point u will harm others because u can't see the truth
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: Haha I understand
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: I'm actually an INFP though 😉
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: Just
27/06/17, 04:00 - Juancho: Not if it gets in the way of the greater good.
27/06/17, 04:00 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: Got a little more INTP over the years
27/06/17, 04:00 - FABIO: hahahaha
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: I think
27/06/17, 04:00 - FABIO: an intelectual as a partner
27/06/17, 04:00 - Didier: The most important is balance
27/06/17, 04:00 - FABIO: so you both can be the same?
27/06/17, 04:01 - FABIO: thats no way to improve yourself
27/06/17, 04:01 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:01 - Didier: I have to have a stronger judging function
27/06/17, 04:01 - FABIO: you need a feelings person
27/06/17, 04:01 - FABIO: as a partner
27/06/17, 04:01 - Didier: Mine is weak
27/06/17, 04:01 - FABIO: so you can evolve
27/06/17, 04:01 - Didier: Yeah true
27/06/17, 04:01 - Didier: Don't forget
27/06/17, 04:01 - Didier: A feeler can also be logical ;)
27/06/17, 04:02 - Juancho: Ik. I want intellectual but also a bit on the softer side when it comes to feelings (more likely to get struck by lightning)
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: way more than you.. when in the feelings field
27/06/17, 04:02 - Didier: What it means to be a feeler is that u r more comfortable making decisions based on ur feelings so u do that
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: dude
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: life
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: is hard
27/06/17, 04:02 - Didier: Hahaha
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: life is no logical
27/06/17, 04:02 - Didier: So yeah get someone healthy is fine
27/06/17, 04:02 - FABIO: how the hell you think you will act.. when you lose a parent?
27/06/17, 04:03 - FABIO: you do not need another asshole as you.. saying scientifc things
27/06/17, 04:03 - Didier: I have met a lot of unhealthy feelers and they r the ones u dun want to deal with
27/06/17, 04:03 - FABIO: in those moments
27/06/17, 04:03 - Didier: Nice,Fabio
27/06/17, 04:04 - Juancho: Hahahahaha. I'd be like: "Actually the human body's muscles have the ability to twitch and the body to be flatulent for days after death so in one way she/he is alive"
27/06/17, 04:04 - FABIO: hahaha
27/06/17, 04:04 - FABIO: thats my point
27/06/17, 04:05 - Didier: Feelers can be intellectuals too.Don't worry Juancho.I know many feelers who have an interest in Science
27/06/17, 04:05 - FABIO: i think.. as logical beings.. we need a person to take care of our hears
27/06/17, 04:05 - FABIO: our mind is nice.. we can do nice for it.. but our hearts
27/06/17, 04:05 - FABIO: is there where the magic happens
27/06/17, 04:05 - Juancho: <sigh> being an INTP is exhausting
27/06/17, 04:06 - FABIO: go watch a studios gibli movie
27/06/17, 04:06 - FABIO: and we can talk
27/06/17, 04:06 - FABIO: hahahahaha
27/06/17, 04:06 - Juancho: That's exactly what we need
27/06/17, 04:06 - Didier: Being an INFP with a strong thinking side is unbelievably more exhausting
27/06/17, 04:06 - Didier: I always tell myself logical decisions
27/06/17, 04:06 - Didier: But then I can't follow them
27/06/17, 04:07 - Didier: Then INFPs feel a lot and and having a strong thinking function too,I feel hurt but tell myself a diff thing
27/06/17, 04:07 - Didier: Like though I feel hurt,I don't think there's anything I should feel hurt about?It's weird haha
27/06/17, 04:07 - FABIO: everyone feels.
27/06/17, 04:07 - Didier: Love them.
27/06/17, 04:08 - FABIO: those fucker... always riped my heart appart.... awesome movies
27/06/17, 04:08 - Didier: I know.Just that INFPs are known to easily absorb emotions more than any type it's weird
27/06/17, 04:08 - Didier: When I am angry,I cry lol
27/06/17, 04:08 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:09 - Juancho: Too bad Bill O' Reilly in not in fox news anymore
27/06/17, 04:09 - Didier: I need to watch more after this graduation year ends
27/06/17, 04:09 - Juancho: I was featured in his show once
27/06/17, 04:10 - Didier: Stopped watching the news haha
27/06/17, 04:10 - FABIO: my infp never watched
27/06/17, 04:10 - FABIO: she doesnt know what expect her
27/06/17, 04:10 - Didier: She doesn't know about it?
27/06/17, 04:10 - Didier: I think INFPs will love it
27/06/17, 04:10 - FABIO: definetly she will...
27/06/17, 04:10 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:10 - Didier: Yep watch with her Fabio
27/06/17, 04:11 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:11 - FABIO: really
27/06/17, 04:11 - FABIO: see no difference
27/06/17, 04:11 - FABIO: from this.... to astrology
27/06/17, 04:12 - Juancho: Dude
27/06/17, 04:12 - Juancho: Please don't
27/06/17, 04:12 - FABIO: you cant see.. how it is affecting your life/
27/06/17, 04:12 - FABIO: ?
27/06/17, 04:12 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:12 - Juancho: It's not even mildly similar
27/06/17, 04:13 - Didier: It's just sth fun haha
27/06/17, 04:13 - FABIO: or you see.. and just let it change you
27/06/17, 04:13 - Didier: Like a guide maybe
27/06/17, 04:13 - Juancho: Astrology suggests that the position of the planets/sun relative to arbitrarily shaped constellations of stars DETERMINES YOUR PERSONALITY (as in depending on the position your personality will change)
27/06/17, 04:14 - Juancho: That is fucking insane
27/06/17, 04:14 - Juancho: They have gone completely mental
27/06/17, 04:14 - FABIO: no.. they are the same.. they are bullshit invented from people.. that other idiots let it control they lifes
27/06/17, 04:14 - Didier: I think mbti is not perfected and has room for improvement,but it is more accurate at least its foundation
27/06/17, 04:14 - Didier: But yeah we don't let it control our life
27/06/17, 04:14 - Didier: It's just good to know?
27/06/17, 04:15 - Didier: But yeah people always invent things
27/06/17, 04:15 - FABIO: really? you guys read that fell too much.. or too little.. and dont change
27/06/17, 04:15 - FABIO: why?
27/06/17, 04:15 - Juancho: MBTI classifies you based on your traits (a classification of species if you will)
27/06/17, 04:15 - Didier: I actually wanna change more haha
27/06/17, 04:15 - Didier: I just don't change a lot
27/06/17, 04:15 - Juancho: Just as if you have certain traits you will either be a frog or a toad
27/06/17, 04:16 - FABIO: i changef from water to wine in months.... best time of my life... awesome growing.. because i let go of this stupid theory.
27/06/17, 04:16 - Juancho: Which is stupid btw. They are the same fucking thing except one has dermatitis.
27/06/17, 04:16 - Didier: Thankfully,we have all the cognitive functions,just some more dominant than the others
27/06/17, 04:17 - Didier: Because we all have E,I,S,N,T,F,J,and P
27/06/17, 04:17 - Didier: So there is room for chang3
27/06/17, 04:17 - Juancho: It almost spelled out einstein
27/06/17, 04:17 - Didier: I think we have classification because it's simply easier?
27/06/17, 04:17 - Juancho: With the exact number of letters left to complete the name
27/06/17, 04:18 - Didier: Like how we classify animals,we try to classify ourselves
27/06/17, 04:18 - Juancho: Yep
27/06/17, 04:18 - Didier: Makes life easier in a way
27/06/17, 04:18 - Didier: Like trying to find ur own clique haha
27/06/17, 04:19 - Juancho: For me it makes everything better when I come home to my dog
27/06/17, 04:19 - Juancho: Man they are just so caring
27/06/17, 04:19 - FABIO: i preffer cat
27/06/17, 04:19 - Juancho: They're bursting with euphoria when you show up
27/06/17, 04:19 - FABIO: dogs ar too touch..
27/06/17, 04:19 - FABIO: cat doesnt give a fuck
27/06/17, 04:20 - Didier: We shouldn't let it restraint us,but let it make us grow further
27/06/17, 04:20 - Didier: Ikr
27/06/17, 04:20 - Didier: I have a toy poodle
27/06/17, 04:20 - Didier: Haha tru
27/06/17, 04:20 - Juancho: I have 1 boxer and one dalmation
27/06/17, 04:20 - Didier: My dog especially when my mom is back...
27/06/17, 04:21 - Didier: Wow 🤣
27/06/17, 04:21 - Juancho: I'm thinking about getting a pitbull or a shiba inu
27/06/17, 04:21 - Didier: 2 is too much to handle for us
27/06/17, 04:21 - Juancho: Hahahah. Mine too.
27/06/17, 04:21 - Juancho: I used to have 5
27/06/17, 04:21 - Didier: Wow

27/06/17, 04:22 - Didier: What if they r left alone
27/06/17, 04:22 - Didier: I would like a shiba inu
27/06/17, 04:22 - Juancho: Mi mid takes care of them when i'm not home
27/06/17, 04:22 - Juancho: They're so cute
27/06/17, 04:22 - Didier: Yep

27/06/17, 04:23 - Juancho: Adopt one
27/06/17, 04:23 - Didier: In the future 😂
27/06/17, 04:23 - Juancho: Me neither
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: So sweet
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: I can't
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: She will be kicked out of the bed by me
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: Too small bed
27/06/17, 04:24 - Juancho: She has kicked me off the bed
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: off the*
27/06/17, 04:24 - Didier: Haha y
27/06/17, 04:25 - Juancho: It pisses me off so she tries to play it off my putting her ears down and looking at me with a sad face
27/06/17, 04:25 - Juancho: Gets me every time
27/06/17, 04:25 - Didier: Same
27/06/17, 04:25 - Didier: That innocent face
27/06/17, 04:25 - Juancho: Hahaha ik.
27/06/17, 04:25 - Didier: I saw an article before
27/06/17, 04:25 - Didier: Talking about that
27/06/17, 04:25 - Juancho: You can't be mad at ir
27/06/17, 04:25 - Juancho: It
27/06/17, 04:25 - Didier: I forgot what it said
27/06/17, 04:26 - Juancho: Wait wait
27/06/17, 04:26 - Juancho: What did we start talking about
27/06/17, 04:26 - Didier: Ummmm
27/06/17, 04:26 - Didier: OH YES
27/06/17, 04:26 - Didier: The vid
27/06/17, 04:26 - Didier: Climbing
27/06/17, 04:26 - Juancho: Of course
27/06/17, 04:27 - Juancho: We started talking about mad man with a death wish
27/06/17, 04:27 - Didier: Fking graduation year...I'm gonna be tortured from tmr onwards
27/06/17, 04:27 - Didier: Wish me gd luck
27/06/17, 04:27 - Juancho: And ended up talking about the face dogs use to make you feel guilty
27/06/17, 04:27 - Didier: How about u?
27/06/17, 04:27 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 04:27 - Juancho: I'm only going to 10th grade
27/06/17, 04:27 - Didier: Will u ever do that?
27/06/17, 04:27 - Janith: Wait are we talking about climbing, political correctness, dogs or graduation?
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: When will u ever agree to doing that?
27/06/17, 04:28 - Juancho: Lucky for you you're graduating
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: Or no
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: Not necessarily
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: We have a weird education system here
27/06/17, 04:28 - Juancho: We went through all of those
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: How old r u again?
27/06/17, 04:28 - Didier: I think we r the same
27/06/17, 04:28 - Juancho: 15
27/06/17, 04:29 - Didier: Ur birthday haven't passed?
27/06/17, 04:29 - Juancho: It dod
27/06/17, 04:29 - Juancho: Did
27/06/17, 04:29 - Juancho: Way back in september
27/06/17, 04:29 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 04:29 - Didier: That means we r the same age
27/06/17, 04:30 - Juancho: You kidding?
27/06/17, 04:30 - Didier: Will be going thru similar things
27/06/17, 04:30 - Didier: Nope
27/06/17, 04:30 - Juancho: Hence the high reliability (that's actually because of MBTI)
27/06/17, 04:30 - Juancho: But still
27/06/17, 04:31 - Didier: High reliability for?
27/06/17, 04:31 - Juancho: Pretty much everything
27/06/17, 04:32 - Juancho: From an idealistic perspective
27/06/17, 04:32 - Didier: It's nice to see ppl the same as me and much older here
27/06/17, 04:32 - Juancho: Yeah
27/06/17, 04:32 - Didier: Makes me curious wondering how life's like over there
27/06/17, 04:32 - Juancho: Where?
27/06/17, 04:32 - Didier: Diff people,diff places haha
27/06/17, 04:32 - Didier: So,all over the world
27/06/17, 04:33 - Juancho: Diff?
27/06/17, 04:33 - Didier: Different
27/06/17, 04:33 - Juancho: Ohh
27/06/17, 04:34 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:35 - Juancho: Damn biggot
27/06/17, 04:35 - Juancho: This is the type of person that pisses me off
27/06/17, 04:35 - Didier: I wonder what's in their heads
27/06/17, 04:35 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 04:35 - Didier: Because skin colour alone is not a good enough reason for me
27/06/17, 04:35 - Didier: Maybe it's their pride as a grp
27/06/17, 04:36 - Didier: Still
27/06/17, 04:36 - Juancho: It's like me voting for a latino running for office just because of his topological origin
27/06/17, 04:36 - Didier: Did they have other reasons?
27/06/17, 04:36 - Juancho: That's cause you're a reasonable logic being
27/06/17, 04:36 - Juancho: Nop
27/06/17, 04:37 - Didier: I must examine a human brain in the future 😈
27/06/17, 04:37 - Didier: What weird beings
27/06/17, 04:37 - Juancho: Hahaha
27/06/17, 04:37 - Didier: I wonder how human beings can understand other human beings when they r so different
27/06/17, 04:37 - Didier: Hope we can know more about this
27/06/17, 04:37 - Juancho: I've always told myself if I don't make it to physics i will go for nuerobiology
27/06/17, 04:38 - Didier: Same
27/06/17, 04:38 - Didier: Neuroscience?
27/06/17, 04:38 - Juancho: Objectiveness
27/06/17, 04:38 - Didier: I just call it neuroscience Idk haha
27/06/17, 04:38 - Juancho: Hahaha
27/06/17, 04:39 - Didier: Let me search
27/06/17, 04:39 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:40 - Didier: Can I just learn neuroscience?That means I'll learn all there is to ot
27/06/17, 04:40 - Didier: it*
27/06/17, 04:40 - Juancho: I encourage you to research about it
27/06/17, 04:40 - Didier: Just learning neurobiology is not as fun
27/06/17, 04:40 - Didier: Yep I will
27/06/17, 04:40 - Juancho: But do it like an INTP
27/06/17, 04:41 - Didier: I'm too tired today though so another day hehe
27/06/17, 04:41 - Juancho: Research the fuck out of it and stay up until 6am reading and then say: "i've read a few thing here and there, yes"
27/06/17, 04:42 - Didier: That's what I always do 😂
27/06/17, 04:42 - Didier: Then in the end I'm like
27/06/17, 04:42 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
27/06/17, 04:42 - Didier: What am I doing with my life lol
27/06/17, 04:42 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
27/06/17, 04:42 - Juancho: Me too
27/06/17, 04:42 - Juancho: It's funny though
27/06/17, 04:42 - Didier: Good to know similar pals
27/06/17, 04:43 - Didier: Ikr especially in a sensor family
27/06/17, 04:43 - Juancho: Afterwards
27/06/17, 04:43 - Didier: Makes me question more
27/06/17, 04:43 - Didier: Oh yes Juancho
27/06/17, 04:43 - Didier: Is ur name literally pronounced Juancho in English?
27/06/17, 04:44 - Didier: Sensing-judging* They can never understand me
27/06/17, 04:45 - Didier: If possible,remind me on a Saturday.I will probably have too many new topics later on to rmb
27/06/17, 04:48 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:48 - Juancho: Technically
27/06/17, 04:51 - Didier: How about Lardizabal?Sounds unique
27/06/17, 04:52 - Didier: 😂omg that's me
27/06/17, 04:52 - Juancho: It's a last name that originated in spain
27/06/17, 04:52 - Didier: Hahaha
27/06/17, 04:52 - Didier: How do u pronounce it
27/06/17, 04:52 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 04:52 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 04:53 - Juancho: Lar-dee-za-ball
27/06/17, 04:53 - Didier: Kk thanks
27/06/17, 04:53 - Didier: Gotta go *flees*
27/06/17, 04:53 - Juancho: Huh?
27/06/17, 04:54 - Didier: Why?Haha
27/06/17, 04:55 - Juancho: Flees? I'm not familiar with some of the american urban slang
27/06/17, 04:55 - Didier: It means I'm running away quickly haha
27/06/17, 04:55 - Juancho: Ohh
27/06/17, 04:55 - Didier: Not slang though
27/06/17, 04:56 - Didier: But yes I use too much colloquial language
27/06/17, 04:56 - Juancho: Really?
27/06/17, 04:56 - Juancho: Colloquial
27/06/17, 04:56 - Juancho: That's the word
27/06/17, 04:56 - Didier: Yep not slang
27/06/17, 04:57 - Didier: As u see it more often,u will come to recognise it
27/06/17, 04:59 - Juancho: You guys ready for the solar eclipse
27/06/17, 05:03 - Janith: Used to do this too but I've gone for a more orderly sleep schedule recently
27/06/17, 05:04 - Didier: Oh really?!Didn't keept up with these things for a while now
27/06/17, 05:04 - Didier: keep*
27/06/17, 05:04 - Didier: When will it be
27/06/17, 05:08 - Janith: Won't it be in August?
27/06/17, 05:10 - Juancho: Yeah
27/06/17, 05:39 - Juancho: Noo
27/06/17, 05:39 - Juancho: FUCK!!!!
27/06/17, 05:39 - Juancho: It happened to me again
27/06/17, 05:40 - Juancho: How tf does this happen dude
27/06/17, 05:40 - Juancho: Seriously
27/06/17, 05:41 - Juancho: I started researching the upcoming solar eclipse and fucking somehow I ended up reading a paper on get this, how the process of treated wood works
27/06/17, 05:41 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 05:41 - Didier: Treated wood?
27/06/17, 05:42 - Juancho: Yeah you know
27/06/17, 05:42 - Juancho: When you get the wood cut into pieces you need to protect it against 'corrosion' by treating it
27/06/17, 05:43 - Juancho: You put it in a chamber you inject preservative into the wood
27/06/17, 05:43 - Juancho: Once it is in the pressurized chamber
27/06/17, 05:44 - Juancho: Huh
27/06/17, 05:44 - Juancho: Wonder was is in the preservative that make it immune to weather
27/06/17, 05:44 - Janith: Here we go again
27/06/17, 05:44 - Juancho: You know what
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: You're rigjt
27/06/17, 05:45 - Janith: 😂
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: Fuck this, i'm going to sleep
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: It's almost 4am
27/06/17, 05:45 - Janith: It is hard to keep focus but learning to do so is invaluable to productivity
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: Hahahahahahaha
27/06/17, 05:45 - Janith: Good night
27/06/17, 05:45 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 05:46 - Juancho: Good night to you all
27/06/17, 05:46 - Juancho: And let's hope a mosquito doesn't fly in front of me and that causes me to research how they digest the blood
27/06/17, 05:47 - Juancho: I'll gotta start writing this stuff down
27/06/17, 05:47 - Janith: My advice, keep certain times or situations where you let your brain go along on whatever road it wishes and others where it's focused
27/06/17, 05:47 - Juancho: It's hard
27/06/17, 05:47 - Juancho: I've tried
27/06/17, 05:47 - Janith: It definitely will be
27/06/17, 05:47 - Janith: But you'll get into it
27/06/17, 05:47 - Juancho: It requires immense discipline
27/06/17, 05:47 - Janith: Took me about 4 years
27/06/17, 05:48 - Juancho: 😬
27/06/17, 05:48 - Janith: And I still haven't mastered it
27/06/17, 05:48 - Janith: But I'm closing in
27/06/17, 05:48 - Juancho: 🙃🙃🙃
27/06/17, 05:48 - Janith: Remember what Einstein said
27/06/17, 05:48 - Janith: "I'm no genius. I just stay on one problem for longer"
27/06/17, 05:48 - Janith: Or something along those lines
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: Damn
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: If i could stay in ONE problem for a ling time
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: On sunday
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: My mom made me go to church with here
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: Dude
27/06/17, 05:49 - Janith: He lied of course. The man was a genius too. But it goes to show just how important focus is
27/06/17, 05:49 - Juancho: I wanted to bang my head against the wall
27/06/17, 05:50 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 05:50 - Janith: Haha so why go?
27/06/17, 05:50 - Juancho: I had 5 questions in mind and i was trying to think and i kept looking out the window to think
27/06/17, 05:50 - Juancho: And she would make me turn around
27/06/17, 05:50 - Janith: I made it clear that I was an atheist to my parents and just refused to partake in religious activity
27/06/17, 05:51 - Janith: Sure there was resistance at first but I kept pushing and they caved before I did
27/06/17, 05:52 - Janith: Try meditating while in church then. It tends to help with focus
27/06/17, 05:52 - Janith: Though you should know, your head is gonna feel like it's gonna explode at first
27/06/17, 05:54 - Juancho: These questions:

1. If for a perpetual motion machine to exist there would need to be no other object in the universe, then how do you know it is indeed in motion?

2. What energy/force is being exerted when an object is at 0k (hypothetically) and when looking at it, the atoms gain motion. 

3. What wakes the strings in string theory vibrate?

4. Why do waves (at an increasing rate) expande as they propagate through space?

5. If space-time travels at the speed of light, are we attracted to the sun's locality 8 minutes prior to the present?
27/06/17, 05:54 - Juancho: I insist.
27/06/17, 05:55 - Juancho: I almost burst into tears (no joke)
27/06/17, 05:56 - Janith: Why does there need to be no other object in the universe?
27/06/17, 05:56 - Juancho: That's why sometimes i hate being an INTP
27/06/17, 05:56 - Juancho: Because the gravity of that object will eventually attract each other and slow it down
27/06/17, 05:57 - Janith: #2 can't really be answered cause we can't get to 0K
27/06/17, 05:57 - Juancho: Hypothetically
27/06/17, 05:57 - Janith: Then there cannot be a perpetual motion machine
27/06/17, 05:57 - Janith: I know most questions are hypothetical. That's where you gotta stop yourself
27/06/17, 05:58 - Juancho: The question is, if there were no other object and you could observe it, how do you know it is in motion
27/06/17, 05:58 - Janith: Keep your thoughts flying within the realm of the universe. If you let it go then there will be no end to the questions
27/06/17, 05:58 - Janith: Amd insanity will be your only destination
27/06/17, 05:58 - Juancho: I mean, i got the perpetual motion question from a wheel of a car passing by. Who the fuck even does that. Seriously. It's irritating af.
27/06/17, 05:59 - Juancho: I can't they just occur to me.
27/06/17, 05:59 - Janith: Well I have an idea
27/06/17, 05:59 - Janith: For the purpose of the experiment we assume the machine is in motion
27/06/17, 05:59 - Juancho: And i have a pathological need for closure (my psychologist identified it, not me)
27/06/17, 06:00 - Janith: And we cannot observe it because we would have to be in the universe to do so
27/06/17, 06:00 - Juancho: But we could render a world
27/06/17, 06:00 - Janith: I think most INTPs have that to some extent. I have it too
27/06/17, 06:00 - Juancho: With that scenario
27/06/17, 06:01 - Janith: No because the moment we observe it, we change the scenario
27/06/17, 06:01 - Juancho: It's been bugging me for days
27/06/17, 06:01 - Juancho: How so?
27/06/17, 06:01 - Janith: To observe it we need a photon. If a photon hits the machine and bounces off it then it disrupts the motion of the machine
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: Ahh
27/06/17, 06:02 - Janith: In addition to that there will be a photon and a detector in the universe
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: You have a point
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: God damn
27/06/17, 06:02 - Janith: Thereby making the scenario void
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: Why didn't i think about that
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: Wow
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: That's genius
27/06/17, 06:02 - Juancho: Of course
27/06/17, 06:03 - Juancho: All types of energy and forces apply
27/06/17, 06:03 - Janith: It's heisenberg
27/06/17, 06:03 - Juancho: And take a toll on motoon
27/06/17, 06:03 - Juancho: Momentum and position
27/06/17, 06:03 - Janith: Exactly
27/06/17, 06:03 - Juancho: Motion*
27/06/17, 06:03 - Janith: Now get some sleep ;)
27/06/17, 06:03 - Juancho: Thanks
27/06/17, 06:03 - Janith: I've saved your questions
27/06/17, 06:04 - Janith: Let me know when you're up. I'll check the others out then and we'll figure them out too
27/06/17, 06:04 - Juancho: The most useful conversation i've had this month
27/06/17, 06:04 - Juancho: Literally
27/06/17, 06:04 - Juancho: Thanks
27/06/17, 06:04 - Janith: Happy to help
27/06/17, 06:07 - Juancho: Aha
27/06/17, 06:07 - Juancho: I overthought again
27/06/17, 06:07 - Juancho: I found a discrepancy in your solution
27/06/17, 06:08 - Juancho: Photons do not interact with the highs field
27/06/17, 06:08 - Juancho: Rendering the photon massless
27/06/17, 06:08 - Juancho: This couldn't possibly affect the motion of the machine
27/06/17, 06:12 - Janith: Photons need something to come out of
27/06/17, 06:13 - Janith: And something to detect it
27/06/17, 06:13 - Janith: Those will always have mass
27/06/17, 06:13 - Juancho: Not if in the rendering they just happen to be there (cause we placed it of course)
27/06/17, 06:13 - Janith: So a detector without mass?
27/06/17, 06:14 - Juancho: It's pointless
27/06/17, 06:14 - Juancho: Impossible scenario
27/06/17, 06:14 - Juancho: The whole premise is somewhat absurd
27/06/17, 06:14 - Janith: Exactly. The moment you try to observe it you break the conditions
27/06/17, 06:15 - Janith: The only way a perpetual motion thing can exist is if it's brought along naturally with the creation of a universe
27/06/17, 06:23 - Juancho: 🖖🏼
27/06/17, 06:24 - Juancho: Live long and prosper
27/06/17, 06:26 - Juancho: Man
27/06/17, 06:26 - Janith: Haha you too man
27/06/17, 06:27 - Juancho: These pro-life people
27/06/17, 06:27 - Juancho: They are irritating
27/06/17, 06:28 - Juancho: They make it their life propose to get  on my nerver
27/06/17, 06:28 - Janith: I wouldn't call them pro-life. Since they don't really care about the fetus after its out of the mother's womb
27/06/17, 06:28 - Juancho: Nerve
27/06/17, 06:28 - Juancho: FINALYYYYY!!!!!!!
27/06/17, 06:28 - Juancho: A person who understands
27/06/17, 06:29 - Juancho: They use the mother during pregnancy as a sort of statement
27/06/17, 06:30 - Janith: Haha yeah it's kinda ironic that they call themselves that actually. If you're truly a "pro-lifer" then you have to be pacifist, vegan and a whole bunch of other things
27/06/17, 06:31 - Janith: They're basically just another religious group if they're just pro-life for human fetuses
27/06/17, 06:32 - Juancho: Yeah but that's a bit of a shitty argument don't you think?
27/06/17, 06:32 - Juancho: 80% of pro life people are men
27/06/17, 06:33 - Juancho: And 70% of pro choice people are woman
27/06/17, 06:33 - Juancho: Something like that
27/06/17, 06:33 - Juancho: I don't recall the figure but it was the vast majority
27/06/17, 06:34 - Janith: In all honesty I just ignore them. They're idiots. Considering everything else that's happening now I can't think of any reason why their cause is worth my time
27/06/17, 06:34 - Juancho: That means that woman who have actually experience birth and the devastating effects of an unwanted child support abortion
27/06/17, 06:34 - Janith: (their cause being illogical bullshit helps too xD)
27/06/17, 06:34 - Juancho: And men who don't know shit about it
27/06/17, 06:34 - Juancho: Support pro life
27/06/17, 06:34 - Juancho: Hahahaha
27/06/17, 06:35 - Janith: Yeah. It's men thinking they get a say in what a woman does with her body
27/06/17, 06:35 - Janith: That's the fundamental error here
27/06/17, 06:35 - Juancho: I mean, I myself would never go for abortion, that being said, why the fuck should I have a say in what other people do with their lives
27/06/17, 06:35 - Juancho: And why should the government either
27/06/17, 06:36 - Juancho: If that will complete fuck over a person's life then it's better to avoid it
27/06/17, 06:36 - Janith: The problem can actually get a little complicated in other cultures. Especially ones where daughters aren't appreciated
27/06/17, 06:37 - Janith: In those situations I think the government should conduct a statistical analysis and go with the numbers
27/06/17, 06:37 - Juancho: Wait
27/06/17, 06:38 - Juancho: I want to send my propsoal
27/06/17, 06:38 - Juancho: Proposal
27/06/17, 06:38 - Janith: Though for the most part I do agree that a person has the right to do what they wish with their body
27/06/17, 06:38 - Janith: Sure thing 😊
27/06/17, 06:39 - Juancho: Cause what's the point of reproach if you don't propose a solution
27/06/17, 06:39 - Juancho: Here is my solution
27/06/17, 06:40 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 06:40 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 06:40 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 06:40 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 06:40 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 06:42 - Juancho: I want to change the "if and only if" to take it to the court and rule it out. If one of the parent doesn't want the baby then that parent will have to take care of the expenses and the parent not wanting the baby should be able to cut all ties with the parent and the baby
27/06/17, 06:44 - Janith: Wait. It costs that much to give birth in the US???
27/06/17, 06:45 - Juancho: Yup
27/06/17, 06:45 - Janith: (personally I think that a baby that isn't wanted should be aborted. No child should have to grow up in an environment where they feel like they are a mistake)
27/06/17, 06:45 - Juancho: The last pages were counterarguments for LITERALLY any possible pro-life argument
27/06/17, 06:45 - Juancho: Of course. It's only logical.
27/06/17, 06:46 - Juancho: If pro life people can throw one argument that can't be refuted by any of these counter-arguments, i'd be throughly impressed
27/06/17, 06:47 - Janith: Solid arguments. The only point I'd contest is the time frame you gave. I understand your motivations but I do think the right for abortion should exist indefinitely till birth
27/06/17, 06:48 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 06:48 - Janith: Yes it's inhumane to do it when the baby can feel pain but if there's a serious defect in the fetus that is only discovered later or some other serious complication then it should be aborted
27/06/17, 06:49 - Janith: Not should be
27/06/17, 06:49 - Juancho: It's not for any reason other than avoiding the incoherent rambling indoctrination i would receive if I didn't ensure that the babies didn't suffer
27/06/17, 06:49 - Juancho: Yes.
27/06/17, 06:49 - Janith: But if the parents wish it, then it should be done
27/06/17, 06:49 - Juancho: Yeah
27/06/17, 06:50 - Janith: There's a fine moral line there 😅
27/06/17, 06:50 - Juancho: But don't you just hate when you win the complete debate with these arguments and the other people are just reluctant to a change in opinions
27/06/17, 06:51 - Janith: I mean I'm not moral in the conventional sense. I don't even pretend to be. But if we are to consider laws that can be implemented then they must have some degree of morality to prevent outrage
27/06/17, 06:51 - Janith: It hurts to be wrong. Some people aren't brave enough to admit it
27/06/17, 06:51 - Juancho: It's so I don't get shattered to pieces when i beat the feminists, at least they'll meet me halfway on that regard
27/06/17, 06:52 - Juancho: True.
27/06/17, 06:52 - Janith: Odd are a lot of NTs struggle with morality
27/06/17, 06:53 - Juancho: I fucking hate this. But since i know it's annoying i accept the truth and what's the point of supporting a stupid idea even when it has been proven to me time after time to be stupid
27/06/17, 06:54 - Juancho: I might as well stop thinking all together
27/06/17, 06:54 - Juancho: And become a robot
27/06/17, 06:54 - Janith: That's what helps us as INTPs. The internal storm caused by a logical inconsistency is far greater for us than the irritation of being wrong. So there's a good chance that we will switch to the right side
27/06/17, 06:54 - Juancho: That does as said no questions asked
27/06/17, 06:54 - Janith: Try being like an AI ;)
27/06/17, 06:55 - Juancho: Hahahahahahah
27/06/17, 06:55 - Juancho: I try to rule out emotions as much as possible
27/06/17, 06:55 - Janith: Living life with a certain level of disconnect from your emotions
27/06/17, 06:55 - Janith: That's actually a bad thing xD
27/06/17, 06:55 - Janith: In theory at least
27/06/17, 06:55 - Janith: It makes us very vulnerable to our emotions
27/06/17, 06:55 - Juancho: Cause well it's not about me but what's most logical and what's going to benefit the vast majority and not affect me
27/06/17, 06:56 - Janith: But if you're anything like me then I presume you don't really care?
27/06/17, 06:56 - Juancho: Cause we don't know how to handle them
27/06/17, 06:56 - Juancho: Yep.
27/06/17, 06:57 - Juancho: Man i've really got to stop using the quote feature
27/06/17, 06:57 - Janith: Well in that case all I can say is that you should tread lightly when it comes to personal relationships
27/06/17, 06:57 - Janith: Especially romance. It can fuck you up 😂
27/06/17, 06:57 - Juancho: Hahahaha
27/06/17, 06:58 - Juancho: I haven't had that experience
27/06/17, 06:58 - Juancho: Would be nice though
27/06/17, 06:58 - Janith: I have ocd so my emotions were getting completely out of hand some time back. It's alright now cause I started taking meds for it
27/06/17, 06:59 - Janith: Like I said, my advice (even though we both know you won't remember it) is to be careful
27/06/17, 06:59 - Janith: Because in all honesty love has too many variables attached to it for anyone to be able to give advice
27/06/17, 07:00 - Juancho: I will remember it subconsciously
27/06/17, 07:00 - Juancho: Crap
27/06/17, 07:00 - Juancho: I missed south park
27/06/17, 07:00 - Juancho: At least transformers 2 is on
27/06/17, 07:01 - Janith: Oh and don't worry. Ne and Fe have been great allies for me in my relationships 😛
27/06/17, 07:01 - Janith: Haha south park you can watch online. As for transformers I have no idea. I stopped watching that a long time ago
27/06/17, 07:03 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 07:03 - Janith: Haha. Get to sleep man
27/06/17, 07:03 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 07:04 - Janith: One more reason not to DOTA
27/06/17, 07:05 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 07:06 - Janith: 😆

27/06/17, 07:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't think you'd talk this much in the beginning if you were in front of the other members of the group
27/06/17, 07:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't really mind it though
27/06/17, 07:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I just find it weird that the group with 'introverts' has more messages than my other groups filled with extroverts
27/06/17, 07:21 - Janith: You gotta consider what we talk about here. INTPs are arguably the most intellectually hungry type and we're the 3rd best debaters
27/06/17, 07:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah, I realized that afterwards
27/06/17, 07:22 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But still
27/06/17, 07:22 - Janith: Odds are this group is a place of learning and putting existing ideas up for scrutiny for a lot of members.

27/06/17, 07:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You can't hide it from another INTP
27/06/17, 07:23 - Janith: 1 or 2

27/06/17, 07:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Only 1 or 2?
27/06/17, 07:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Damn

27/06/17, 07:27 - Janith: Ah okay. I understand. I just try to type on English as much as possible. I'd feel the same if I tried to type in another language too

27/06/17, 07:29 - Janith: I just don't care 😅
Either my friends can understand what I type in English or they can just tell me when we meet next
27/06/17, 07:29 - Janith: Typing in a phone is annoying enough with autocorrect

27/06/17, 07:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Othed types would just ask 'what are you interests'
27/06/17, 07:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You'll scare him/her if you say that we aren't talkative...
27/06/17, 07:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Basil, friendly advice: Turn off notifications when you want to sleep
27/06/17, 07:36 - Janith: Well it's not that we aren't talkative. Just that I'm not as talkative as some of the others. Most of the time I just lurk
27/06/17, 07:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Exactly
27/06/17, 07:37 - Janith: Or if you want to get any work done
27/06/17, 07:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or if you have a headache
27/06/17, 07:37 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬: Hhhhhh
Okay😌😂
27/06/17, 07:37 - Janith: But not if you want to see how your phone's vibrate feature is working
27/06/17, 07:38 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬: 😂
27/06/17, 07:38 - Janith: Because this group is great for testing that out
27/06/17, 07:38 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬: You're funny ppl😂
27/06/17, 07:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We were confracted my samsung and apple to stress test their phones
27/06/17, 07:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not to brag or anything
27/06/17, 07:38 - Janith: We're a funny type 😏
27/06/17, 07:39 - Janith: I blame the Ne
27/06/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But not the weird-funy
27/06/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The haha-funny
27/06/17, 07:39 - Janith: It's like being on LSD 24/7
27/06/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But without the brain damage
27/06/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Unless you don't sleep
27/06/17, 07:40 - Janith: I'm not so sure about that 😆
27/06/17, 07:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Like juancho
27/06/17, 07:40 - Arne: 👀👀
27/06/17, 07:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
27/06/17, 07:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We're kinda screwed, huh?
27/06/17, 07:41 - Janith: Pretty much. But have you seen the sane people?? They're so boring
27/06/17, 07:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ikr
27/06/17, 07:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I have this weird theory
27/06/17, 07:42 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 07:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It looks TOO happy...
27/06/17, 07:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Wait...
27/06/17, 07:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Are you a guy?
27/06/17, 07:43 - Janith: Yes. I am XY
27/06/17, 07:43 - Janith: You?
27/06/17, 07:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Janith is a female name here
27/06/17, 07:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
27/06/17, 07:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm male
27/06/17, 07:44 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: M/F Basil?
27/06/17, 07:44 - Janith: Yeah. There seems to be a few places where Janith is a female name
27/06/17, 07:44 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬: Mmm
 Iam currently a medical student 
Also interested in mathematics and Astrophysics.
27/06/17, 07:45 - Janith: Or you know... any of the other infinite options
27/06/17, 07:45 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬: 😌😂😂😂😂😂😂
27/06/17, 07:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Pls no

XY
👱🏻
27/06/17, 07:45 - Janith: But we'd prefer a biological sex I think 😐
27/06/17, 07:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Phew
27/06/17, 07:45 - Janith: *😂
27/06/17, 07:46 - Juancho: @94754191589 You said you take meds for OCD
27/06/17, 07:46 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If you came here with that 'I indentify as *insert your choice of retardation*' I would've left the group
27/06/17, 07:46 - Janith: @50494800614 GO TO SLEEP!! 😂😂😂
27/06/17, 07:46 - Juancho: What is the primary active ingredient in your meds?
27/06/17, 07:46 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Dude...
27/06/17, 07:46 - Janith: Setraline HCL. I take 50mg
27/06/17, 07:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You need to sleep
27/06/17, 07:47 - Janith: It's a serotonin supplement if I remember correctly
27/06/17, 07:47 - Juancho: I just can't. Idk why. I haven't slept in over 24hrs and i'm not even sleepy.
27/06/17, 07:47 - Juancho: Ik
27/06/17, 07:47 - Janith: As far as gender goes there's unfortunately a ton of options
27/06/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Male, female, bigender
27/06/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 3 to be exact
27/06/17, 07:48 - Janith: Do yourself a favor. Install the Twilight app on your phone and go for the lowest color temperature and brightness
27/06/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If you have a pp then you're male
27/06/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If you have a hooha then you're female
27/06/17, 07:48 - Janith: No no no. You're confusing sex with gender
27/06/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If both, then you're sad because society is assinine
27/06/17, 07:49 - Janith: Gender is purely social. Sex is the biological one
27/06/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
27/06/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah, sex
27/06/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't give a fuck abkut how someone identifies
27/06/17, 07:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'll treat someone how they want to be treated, but the things some people intentify as makes me cringe
27/06/17, 07:50 - Janith: As far as sex goes there's 2 main. XY and XX. Most of the others are mutations. Infertility means they can't be taken as categories
27/06/17, 07:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I have a physical cringe
27/06/17, 07:51 - ‪+249 12 653 9091‬ saiu
27/06/17, 07:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Was it something I said?
27/06/17, 07:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Probably
27/06/17, 07:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Sorry guys
27/06/17, 07:52 - Janith: Aww shame. I wanted to ask the med student about intersex
27/06/17, 07:52 - Janith: Whatever ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
27/06/17, 07:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Intersex?
27/06/17, 07:52 - Janith: Yeah. Technically the third sex
27/06/17, 07:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Oh
27/06/17, 07:52 - Janith: Hermaphrodites I think
27/06/17, 07:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or, non pc: shemales
27/06/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If you wanna get hit
27/06/17, 07:53 - Janith: Again it's a mutation if I remember correctly but they're fertile so they need to be considered
27/06/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
27/06/17, 07:53 - Janith: True. But I don't like the term because it doesn't really carry meaning
27/06/17, 07:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yup
27/06/17, 07:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: How do I quote?
27/06/17, 07:54 - Janith: Though are shemales actual hermaphrodites?
27/06/17, 07:55 - Janith: I don't think they count as hermaphrodites if they don't have ovaries. Though they have breasts so I guess I can assume they have ovaries
27/06/17, 07:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The have female hormones though
27/06/17, 07:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I thought that mattered
27/06/17, 07:55 - Janith: Yeah. So it can be assumed that they have ovaries
27/06/17, 07:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
27/06/17, 07:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I haven't really read much about medical topics
27/06/17, 07:56 - Janith: I can't remember if they have functioning testes though so I dunno
27/06/17, 07:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's peobably a great way to procrastinate
27/06/17, 07:56 - Janith: Ah okay so what fields are you into?
27/06/17, 07:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Physics and psychology seem awesome, but i don't get far when starting a book about psych and i always procrastinate doing my physics homework
27/06/17, 07:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: So I'm nkt very knowledgable
27/06/17, 07:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Philosophy seems interesting too
27/06/17, 07:59 - Janith: I'm interested in those too. I'm currently reading the lucifer effect. I think you'd enjoy it if you out haven't read it already
27/06/17, 07:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I haven't
27/06/17, 07:59 - Janith: I have a system where I don't usually start a new book or game or something until I finish the one I'm currently on
27/06/17, 08:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I can't do that
27/06/17, 08:00 - Janith: It helps keep me focused on something till the end
27/06/17, 08:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I have about 4ish novels I haven't finished yet
27/06/17, 08:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And a dozen school projects 😭
27/06/17, 08:01 - Janith: Philosophy is quite interesting. Though after absurdism I kinda stopped. I guess I got a working model for the 'why' question
27/06/17, 08:01 - Janith: As for books, I recommend my method. I don't know any other way to stop procrastination
27/06/17, 08:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My novels are why I procrastinate
27/06/17, 08:02 - Janith: As far as projects go.. I guess you should keep a dedicated schedule
27/06/17, 08:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And I procrastinate finishing them
27/06/17, 08:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I have a scedule
27/06/17, 08:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Keeping to it though...
27/06/17, 08:03 - Janith: I know. It's near impossible.
27/06/17, 08:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
27/06/17, 08:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I keep thinking 'I'll start in five minutes' and then it's suddenly midnight
27/06/17, 08:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Well fuck. I'll start the mome t I wake up tomorrow'
27/06/17, 08:04 - Janith: Start whenever you think that. ;)
27/06/17, 08:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That awkward moment when a five minute study break lasts an entire semester...
27/06/17, 08:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Oops, I guess?'
27/06/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ah fuck
27/06/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm procrastinating again
27/06/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I need to study
27/06/17, 08:06 - Janith: Haha me too
27/06/17, 08:06 - Janith: I'll see you later then
27/06/17, 08:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Birds of a feather-'
27/06/17, 08:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Goodbye
27/06/17, 10:23 - Amin: Microsoft office
27/06/17, 10:23 - Amin: What do you think about it?
27/06/17, 10:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Gonna go outta business soon I think
27/06/17, 10:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There was this monopoly of Microsoft's microsoft office venture. No one provided services like it did. It's got competition in the form of Google now
27/06/17, 11:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It won't go out of business
27/06/17, 11:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Companies are more likely to opt for microsoft due to Portal

27/06/17, 11:25 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
27/06/17, 11:26 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: but I have to think a bit, and since english is not my mother tongue maybe need some time to answer 😊
27/06/17, 11:26 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You really don't have to

27/06/17, 11:28 - Janith: You guys should definitely download and check out space Engine
27/06/17, 11:28 - Janith: It's a 1:1 simulation of the visible universe?
27/06/17, 11:28 - Janith: *!

27/06/17, 11:29 - Janith: What's your gpu?
27/06/17, 11:29 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: i can only speak for myself, and I don't consider myself a judging person. So there are generally not many topics U or other persons can step on eggshells 😊
27/06/17, 11:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Cool
27/06/17, 11:30 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: but I call out bs when I hear it ✌🏼

27/06/17, 11:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because my system takes 1 gb and leaves about 3
27/06/17, 11:32 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: no I mean if people denying holocaust oder sugarcoating something
27/06/17, 11:32 - Janith: I'm literally staring at the hubble deep field image (or something that looks exactly like it)
27/06/17, 11:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And then there is background apps that take abkut 300mb
27/06/17, 11:33 - Janith: Unknown. The simulator is free and only 1gb to download

27/06/17, 11:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Were you that impressed?
27/06/17, 11:34 - Janith: I even got trapped inside sagittarius A for a bit 😅
27/06/17, 11:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'I MUST INFORM THE MASSES OF THIS BRILLIANCE!'
27/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: yeah 😊 but can get awkward sometimes if u r dating or  talking  to new people 🎉
27/06/17, 11:35 - Janith: Dude, it just stops you dead in your tracks when you're going through it
27/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: But there are also some appreciating that
27/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Will check the simulator now ✌🏼
27/06/17, 11:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because I had that reaction when I found out that middle mouse button opens a new window to view whatever you clicked on in steam
27/06/17, 11:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The worst thing you can do is to allow people to believe their missconceptions
27/06/17, 11:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: So I agree with your way of doing things
27/06/17, 11:36 - Janith: You can go from 100m/s on planets to 326e6 light years per second
27/06/17, 11:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I assume that you have mkre than the minimum requirements?
27/06/17, 11:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I swear that I will downgrade to fucking android 6.0 just for my old keyboard
27/06/17, 11:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: These spelling errors are chipping away at my soul
27/06/17, 11:38 - Janith: Err.. Yeah
i7 2.6Ghz
16gb ram 
4gb vram gtx 960m 😅
27/06/17, 11:38 - Janith: Why not try another keyboard app?
27/06/17, 11:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't like the way they look...
27/06/17, 11:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And aesthetics is important to me in this regard
27/06/17, 11:40 - Janith: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin

Not even Google keyboard?
27/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Google makes android...
27/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Thisnis their keyboard
27/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: This is*
27/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ajdufbrsixbd
27/06/17, 11:40 - Janith: Yeah... Good point. I thought it was a separate app
27/06/17, 11:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Nope
27/06/17, 11:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I will murder the person who thought that it was a good idea to change the keyboard
27/06/17, 11:42 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: umm coworkers blocking the internet 😅 1 hour download time.  Will check that when I'm at home
27/06/17, 11:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Haha
27/06/17, 11:42 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 11:43 - Janith: I have no idea where I am. I kinda got lost a little while back
27/06/17, 11:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's a good thing that my last test is tomorrow
27/06/17, 11:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Otherwise I wouldn't have studied for anything after that
27/06/17, 11:43 - Janith: But that thing I've selected is the milky way (the entire galaxy probably)
27/06/17, 11:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because that looks pretty amazing
27/06/17, 11:44 - Janith: Hang on I'll see if I can't get back to the galaxy
27/06/17, 11:44 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Where did you guys get the invite link?
27/06/17, 11:45 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 11:45 - Janith: From the INTP procrastination station for me 😛
27/06/17, 11:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Where's that?
27/06/17, 11:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I got it from the INTP discord
27/06/17, 11:46 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Wolfe, just say whatever you want
27/06/17, 11:46 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: ahh u made me remember something /my exams take place in 2 weeks😅 /didn't done anything for them the whole  semester /   will go for social isolation soon 😄
27/06/17, 11:47 - Janith: Just above the milky way
27/06/17, 11:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You dan't need to articulate what you want to say that presicely
27/06/17, 11:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I know the feeling
27/06/17, 11:47 - Janith: That's probably all the pictures I'll be taking for today. I got stuck in sagittarius A again 😅
27/06/17, 11:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Noice
27/06/17, 11:47 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: got it from a intp site on Facebook
27/06/17, 11:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That trancends 1st world problems
27/06/17, 11:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Cool
27/06/17, 11:48 - Janith: Basically I had to look for a dot of light that represents our entire visible universe
27/06/17, 11:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Damn
27/06/17, 11:49 - Janith: From almost inside the event horizon the universe looks like a small globe
27/06/17, 11:49 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: 😄
27/06/17, 11:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Has the simulator made you contemplate your mortality yet?
27/06/17, 11:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or better known as 'INTP fun'
27/06/17, 11:50 - Janith: Well.....I'm not sure. I think something inside me just clicked and broke at the same time
27/06/17, 11:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or were you waiting for your shower time?
27/06/17, 11:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or whem you want to sleep?
27/06/17, 11:51 - Janith: Oh shit that reminds me. I gotta go take a shower
27/06/17, 11:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I joke about this
27/06/17, 11:51 - Janith: Thanks @27729159203
27/06/17, 11:51 - Janith: 😂
27/06/17, 11:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Thanks for reminding you, or thanks for fucking up your mood?
27/06/17, 11:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Cause I should either say 'you're welcome' or 'sorry'
27/06/17, 11:52 - Janith: I don't know...but one thing's for certain. The universe is amazing
27/06/17, 11:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yup
27/06/17, 11:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It is pretty cool
27/06/17, 11:53 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: I think there's no need to be sad about the concept of mortality 😊
27/06/17, 11:53 - Janith: More than anything it's stuff like this that makes me lose interest in fiction. I mean our universe as it is can be unimaginably amazing.
27/06/17, 11:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I love fiction as a means of distraction
27/06/17, 11:54 - Janith: considering that our brains can only function like they do now only if we're mortal, You're definitely right
27/06/17, 11:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Hurr hurr, look at me. I'm edgy'
27/06/17, 11:54 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: 😁
27/06/17, 11:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not the fact that we're mortal. The fact that we're impermanent
27/06/17, 11:55 - Janith: I like fiction too...some varieties at least
27/06/17, 11:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That everything is impermanent
27/06/17, 11:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The universal bubble theory fucked me up for about a week
27/06/17, 11:56 - Janith: Though I gotta admit that I kinda despise fiction that tries to bring stuff like magic into this universe.
27/06/17, 11:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'One day the universe will pop' 
'Oh, that's coo- Ah fuck'
27/06/17, 11:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I like magic
27/06/17, 11:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It is perfetly impossible
27/06/17, 11:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Perfectly*
27/06/17, 11:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You mean like Harry Potter?
27/06/17, 11:56 - Janith: THIS! 
This was what I was thinking when I was in the simulated sagittarius A
27/06/17, 11:57 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay...
27/06/17, 11:57 - Janith: Yeah. I can't avoid thinking about how many laws of physics must be broken for each spell to work xD
27/06/17, 11:57 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My train of thohght is 'how can this adhere to the laws of physics'
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: There was a time when I wished to be bitten by a vampire/ preferably  sometimes in my 20s or 30s
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: As in 'is there a way for this to work'
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: but now I try to fancy impermanence
27/06/17, 11:58 - Janith: I tried that too. Doesn't work most of the time
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Immortality is a motherfucker
27/06/17, 11:58 - Didier: And no baby should be made just because of their thoughtless parents
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: it frees u when u stop trying to cling at stuff
27/06/17, 11:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆😆
27/06/17, 11:58 - Didier: Will only end up in a disaster
27/06/17, 11:58 - Janith: I think the fact that everything is temporary is what gives it meaning
27/06/17, 11:58 - Didier: I'm late haha
27/06/17, 11:59 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: And I got a bit of OCD 🙈
27/06/17, 11:59 - Janith: Same here 😀
27/06/17, 11:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That was somewhat cheesy, Janith
27/06/17, 11:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But I understand your sentiment
27/06/17, 12:00 - Janith: Agreed.
27/06/17, 12:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's good that you won't deny it
27/06/17, 12:00 - Janith: We as humans tend to either lose interest or underestimate the value of anything we consider permanent
27/06/17, 12:00 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: cheesy but absolutely right 👌🏼
27/06/17, 12:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: True
27/06/17, 12:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We get bored rather easily
27/06/17, 12:01 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: https://youtu.be/e2xxizpHuoo
27/06/17, 12:01 - Didier: Sorry but what is pro life?
27/06/17, 12:01 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: It's so good tbh
27/06/17, 12:02 - Janith: Is it just boredom though?
27/06/17, 12:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
27/06/17, 12:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It loses significance
27/06/17, 12:02 - Janith: Maybe our brain wasn't geared toward holding onto things which we can reasonable assume will not change
27/06/17, 12:02 - Didier: Actually I noticed introverts talk even more online.It's not that we don't talk,we just won't talk irl
27/06/17, 12:03 - Janith: *reasonably
27/06/17, 12:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why is everyone jumping out of the woodwork now?
27/06/17, 12:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Are european workdays over now?
27/06/17, 12:04 - Janith: Pro-life basically means "As long as the baby isn't born it's my problem too. After it's born fuck the little shit and the irresponsible parent who birthed it"
27/06/17, 12:04 - Janith: There's a correlation there. Introverts generally are more social online
27/06/17, 12:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Abortian is a no-no to pro-lifers
27/06/17, 12:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: As in as long as it is possile for something to live, it should. I think?
27/06/17, 12:05 - Janith: Also it should be noted that most pro-lifers are men and religious
27/06/17, 12:05 - Didier: What if are on LSD?I won't know bc I'll never take it
27/06/17, 12:05 - Arne: It's so sad that there are still people believing the earth is flat
27/06/17, 12:05 - Didier: Yep,a platform for us
27/06/17, 12:06 - Janith: I might be able to get back to you on that in another year or 2
27/06/17, 12:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: @6582280971 are you just going through the fuck ton of messages that were accumulated whilst you were gone,
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: Haha sure
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: Yep
27/06/17, 12:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Damn
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: Dun want to miss anything
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: Hahaha
27/06/17, 12:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Good luck with that
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: Abortion is quite controversial
27/06/17, 12:06 - Didier: I would need to think more about it but
27/06/17, 12:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: How many messages werw there?
27/06/17, 12:07 - Janith: @6582280971  Bravo! you're doing something that very few people ever do. Or even think of doing
27/06/17, 12:07 - Arne: Over 9000
27/06/17, 12:07 - Didier: The most important key is to put urself in the position
27/06/17, 12:07 - Didier: Would I love my child after she/he is born?
27/06/17, 12:07 - Didier: Would the child live properly?
27/06/17, 12:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yay~ old refferences
27/06/17, 12:07 - Didier: Blame the Ne 😂
27/06/17, 12:08 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: i got a harder time communicating with people that  I  just got to know on WhatsApp, than irl 😅
27/06/17, 12:08 - Didier: Hmm,maybe cuz u can't see faces?
27/06/17, 12:08 - Didier: Or?
27/06/17, 12:08 - Didier: R u new?
27/06/17, 12:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I hate to break this to you, Wolfe
27/06/17, 12:08 - Janith: Wait. So you find real life communication easier than whatsapp at first?
27/06/17, 12:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But you might not be INTP
27/06/17, 12:08 - Didier: It depends haha
27/06/17, 12:09 - Didier: Some ppl need this facial recognition thing
27/06/17, 12:09 - Arne: Whut
27/06/17, 12:09 - Didier: Lemme read more first
27/06/17, 12:09 - Arne: Do you all are experts in talking on WhatsApp to people you like?
27/06/17, 12:09 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: I got to know a girl on Thursday at a club
27/06/17, 12:09 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Talking no problem
27/06/17, 12:09 - Janith: I think that may be because in a social situation you tend to go with Ne
27/06/17, 12:09 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Get away from me you filthy normie
27/06/17, 12:09 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Got home and no clue wtf to write ✌🏼
27/06/17, 12:10 - Arne: Same
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: No face expression , no voice
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+1 (418) 409-7540‬: Irl you can see people's expressions. Hi I'm new and I agree with Wolfe
27/06/17, 12:10 - Janith: Now now Wian. Play nice with the kids 😂
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You're giving me an inferiority complex
27/06/17, 12:10 - Arne: But it's the same in real life. Ugh
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It isn't
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: i don't get social clues in real life 😊 but talking is no problem
27/06/17, 12:10 - Janith: I used to have that too. Facial expressions and body language is very important in communication
27/06/17, 12:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: People don't look you in the eyes on whatsapp and wait for your respense
27/06/17, 12:11 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 12:11 - Didier: I stutter when I wanna talk irl
27/06/17, 12:11 - Didier: Which doesn't help me in getting my points across
27/06/17, 12:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Me too
27/06/17, 12:11 - Arne: For me, I am bad at talking irl, I find it more comfortable to talk on WhatsApp. But the thing is, you can check all convo's. So when it gets awkward. You fucked up
27/06/17, 12:11 - Didier: Yep that's y it's good
27/06/17, 12:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I want to say something and then say something related at the same time
27/06/17, 12:11 - Janith: Maybe you do most of your communicating non-verbally?
27/06/17, 12:11 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 12:12 - Didier: I like how we r trying to explain his
27/06/17, 12:13 - Didier: Wolfe can I have an intro please ;)
27/06/17, 12:13 - Arne: And also, in real life I ain't the guy that will talk to people I don't know good. So it is the same on WhatsApp. This might be because you know who the people are, and you'll see them everyday. If they are complete strangers (just like you). It's so more easily
27/06/17, 12:13 - Arne: Thanks lol
27/06/17, 12:13 - Arne: Just like you, I mean everyone here
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Text convos always get weird  😄 either writing massive amounts of text or not replying for days. Can't find to seem Balance in that
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ah shit
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I've been procrastinating for an hour
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I need to go
27/06/17, 12:14 - Arne: Byee
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Bye
27/06/17, 12:14 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Talking to complete strangers works ✌🏼 even on hard topics
27/06/17, 12:15 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Bye 👋
27/06/17, 12:15 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I always procrastinate until deadline
27/06/17, 12:15 - Arne: I'm procrastinating for like an hour and half
27/06/17, 12:15 - Janith: I got the chameleon aspect of being an INTP down so I do well in social situations when I'm in the mood
27/06/17, 12:15 - Janith: See you later!
27/06/17, 12:16 - Arne: Same. But sometimes I do realize I should do something, and that works (sometimes)
27/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: I do that too. Some days I'm pretty talkative on here but most days I'm a lurker
27/06/17, 12:17 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Important things first then work on deadlines
27/06/17, 12:17 - Janith: Don't worry about it. The benefits of texting is that most of the time instant replies aren't expected
27/06/17, 12:18 - Arne: But sometimes they skip you for  a couple minutes without checking your messGe
27/06/17, 12:18 - Arne: So I get always the feeling: do they want me to talk to them, or not?
27/06/17, 12:18 - Arne: It's discouraging
27/06/17, 12:18 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: for me it's sometimes like 3-4 days that I need to reply 😁
27/06/17, 12:19 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: People are like wtf then
27/06/17, 12:19 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: I put it off for later and forget about it then
27/06/17, 12:19 - Janith: I get that too but only with people I really care about
27/06/17, 12:20 - Didier: Skip you for a couple min?
27/06/17, 12:20 - Arne: Uhhhh, only to the ones I don't want a convorsation with. So not opening chat when they say something.
27/06/17, 12:21 - Didier: Btw guys
27/06/17, 12:21 - Janith: That's alright too. This is an introvert group after all. Message when you can and lurk when you can't. As long as you enjoy yourself and gain something from this
27/06/17, 12:21 - Didier: Since we were on the topic of abortion
27/06/17, 12:21 - Didier: I would like to have more thoughts on it
27/06/17, 12:22 - Didier: U know I had this experience
27/06/17, 12:22 - Didier: I still rmb when I was in my mother's womb
27/06/17, 12:22 - Didier: I wasn't able to move much but
27/06/17, 12:22 - Janith: Oh and everyone here should check out the simulator I mentioned if they can. It's definitely something anyone who likes space will enjoy
27/06/17, 12:22 - Didier: It was comepletely dark (no light)
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: And apparently I'm not the only one
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: Many others online experienced this too
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: My mom thought it was a joke until she realised it isn't
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: I have been telling her since I was born
27/06/17, 12:23 - Arne: Wow, so you was somehow aware of your self in these earlier days?
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: I have a fear or the dark from the start
27/06/17, 12:23 - Didier: And I kept wanting to get out of there
27/06/17, 12:23 - Arne: I am also afraid for the dark
27/06/17, 12:24 - Didier: And surprisingly,I'm a premature baby too
27/06/17, 12:24 - Didier: Yes,but only for a short while
27/06/17, 12:24 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: Ahh, it's not a group convo thing. It happens with friends sometimes if I don't want to talk at that moment or want to formulate a really good answer. And then I forget about it. I don't feel pressured in group talks.  But I'm impressed with the talkativity here 😊 I like u guys
27/06/17, 12:24 - Janith: What are the odds that the fear of the dark that's present in most children is cause of their memories from the womb?
27/06/17, 12:24 - Didier: So I believe some babies already have the potential to feel and think a bit when they r developed in the womb
27/06/17, 12:25 - Didier: Thanks that's nice 😊
27/06/17, 12:25 - Didier: Any thoughts ppl?
27/06/17, 12:25 - Arne: The first things I remember are when I was 4
27/06/17, 12:25 - Didier: Oh yeah,nvr thought of that thanks
27/06/17, 12:25 - Didier: Now that I think of it,it's possible
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: What if they just don't rmb?
27/06/17, 12:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Nice insight
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: When I was in the womb,I still rmb feeling other beings out there
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: But I don't know how they look like
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: Or whether they even exist
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: Because I can't see them
27/06/17, 12:26 - Janith: I agree with you. From the beginning of the trimester onwards I think that fetuses should be able to formulate some thought
27/06/17, 12:26 - Didier: And I think this experience is quite rare?
27/06/17, 12:27 - Janith: I mean their eyes are developed. I think it's only the eyelashes that develop in the third trimester
27/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: That's why I wanna get more info on it as research
27/06/17, 12:27 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: never thought about that. And also can't recall memories that early. But the fear of the dark things sounds Interesting
27/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: Exactly
27/06/17, 12:27 - Janith: The eyes are done in the first
27/06/17, 12:27 - Arne: We ain't night animals, and in this new world with electric. Light, there aren't any dark places. So you don't have to deal with your first at a young age, so it can develop to a "afraid of" situation? 

Thoughts?
27/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: The features r already mostly developed
27/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: We need research on this
27/06/17, 12:27 - Didier: Deal with ur first?
27/06/17, 12:27 - ‪+49 1511 2222280‬: But can answer the lsd question that plopped of earlier 😊 but I need the origination question or statement for that
27/06/17, 12:28 - Arne: Fears* *
27/06/17, 12:28 - Didier: Yeah but when lights r off
27/06/17, 12:28 - Didier: That will be a problem
27/06/17, 12:28 - Arne: When I was young, I always slept with a little light
27/06/17, 12:28 - Janith: Here's the thing. I don't think my idea of the fear of the dark is too solid. The mother's womb is the safest environment a baby will ever be in. It's illogical to think that the baby would fear it
27/06/17, 12:28 - Didier: Possible
27/06/17, 12:28 - Didier: But bc u already see the darkness before
27/06/17, 12:28 - Didier: U can fear it too?
27/06/17, 12:29 - Didier: It looks scary in a way after all
27/06/17, 12:29 - Janith: Ne being like tripping on acid
27/06/17, 12:29 - Didier: I always need to sleep with some light haha
27/06/17, 12:29 - Janith: What are the odds that darkness is an evolutionary fear?
27/06/17, 12:29 - Didier: I actually felt kinda safe and unsafe when I was conscious at that time
27/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: I felt safe bc I felt like I was protected by something
27/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: I felt unsafe because I'm still unfamiliar with what's out there?
27/06/17, 12:30 - Arne: I usually had it too, but because my ears where sensitive (in the way of hearing sounds) that made me fear darkness even more, when you hear thinks you can't directly explain. So I always have some music on a very low volume.
27/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: And it was total darkness
27/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: I had the fear because it feels void Idk
27/06/17, 12:30 - Janith: Because darkness is similar to sensory deprivation. And the brain tends to freak out when deprived of its main sense
27/06/17, 12:30 - Didier: Diffucult to explain
27/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: It's like endless possibilities in the dark
27/06/17, 12:31 - Janith: Fascinating. So you remember feeling like that from before you were born?
27/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: Yes
27/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: It's fascinating until now
27/06/17, 12:31 - Didier: I'm still looking for people who r the same irl
27/06/17, 12:32 - Didier: Looks like no one else in the family is the same
27/06/17, 12:32 - Didier: That's y when I hear those "scientists" say abortion is fine,they don't feel anything,I doubt them
27/06/17, 12:32 - Didier: I don't think enough resesrch has been done to justify that
27/06/17, 12:32 - Janith: I really hope that we can start birthing babies in artificial wombs soon. It would give us a chance to use MRI to figure out what stage of development fetuses become capable of thought
27/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: Is MRI enough though?
27/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: We can use it to detect movements
27/06/17, 12:33 - Didier: But we r still not in the baby's position
27/06/17, 12:33 - Janith: The thing is, most abortions happen within the first trimester. Too early for thoughts like yours
27/06/17, 12:34 - Arne: Movements of a baby is normal, I thought
27/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: So it's still difficult
27/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: Haha might be like that
27/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: Not all abortions though sadly
27/06/17, 12:34 - Janith: Later abortions only have that ethical concern
27/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: When I was able to think then,I was able to move already
27/06/17, 12:34 - Janith: I can't do empathy too well 😅
27/06/17, 12:34 - Didier: So I believe it's somehow related
27/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: Haha it's fine
27/06/17, 12:35 - Didier: Just imagine another being and we can't be in the same body and have the same brain as them
27/06/17, 12:36 - Janith: Unfortunately you can't get much from that. Consciousness might have started in you from the third trimester.
27/06/17, 12:36 - Janith: Or it could have been earlier
27/06/17, 12:36 - Didier: I think the baby won't even know that they r in the mother's womb?
27/06/17, 12:36 - Didier: I think they can feel sth
27/06/17, 12:36 - Arne: Can you also don't be aware of your conscious? Or is that impossible
27/06/17, 12:36 - Didier: But they aren't sure
27/06/17, 12:37 - Janith: True but my ability to emphasize is much lower than yours. For me the abortion question is mostly feasibility and opinion
27/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: Yeah
27/06/17, 12:38 - Arne: Also studies show that each time you think back to a memory, that happened, it will show your memory every time a little bit different. 

Not saying anything with this.
27/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: I would call that subconscious
27/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: Not fully conscious
27/06/17, 12:38 - Arne: You are right
27/06/17, 12:38 - Janith: The baby won't have the necessary background knowledge to know where they are
27/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: Yeah that's why
27/06/17, 12:38 - Didier: So they might still fear
27/06/17, 12:39 - Didier: It's weird
27/06/17, 12:39 - Didier: I wanna meet more ppl who have had the same experience
27/06/17, 12:39 - Didier: Is there anyone who did resesrch on this
27/06/17, 12:39 - Janith: This is why we need to grow a baby in an FMRI 😂
27/06/17, 12:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well the info is already available
27/06/17, 12:40 - Janith: We'll be able to know when the thought processes start
27/06/17, 12:40 - Didier: It's the safest but they still fear because of the unknown?
27/06/17, 12:40 - Didier: Like,a baby won't know
27/06/17, 12:40 - Janith: Yes precisely. Compared with being born the womb is heaven but the fetus has nothing to compare it to
27/06/17, 12:41 - Didier: Surprisingly I still can rmb when I was a few months old,not much though
27/06/17, 12:41 - Didier: Yeah,because they haven't been to anywhere else
27/06/17, 12:41 - Janith: Few months as in after birth right?
27/06/17, 12:41 - Didier: I think so
27/06/17, 12:42 - Didier: Like when my mom was playing peek a boo with me
27/06/17, 12:42 - Didier: On a sofa
27/06/17, 12:43 - Janith: Damn. I have near zero recollection of my life before age 7. Barely any before 12
27/06/17, 12:43 - Arne: That's weird
27/06/17, 12:43 - Didier: Wow
27/06/17, 12:43 - Arne: For me, at least
27/06/17, 12:43 - Didier: Yeah that's weird to me haha
27/06/17, 12:43 - Didier: Cuz I remember before that
27/06/17, 12:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I can relate
27/06/17, 12:43 - Didier: I think looking at old videos when u were young helps?
27/06/17, 12:43 - Didier: It builds a more solid memory
27/06/17, 12:44 - Didier: Wow really
27/06/17, 12:44 - Didier: It's the same for u?
27/06/17, 12:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep
27/06/17, 12:44 - Arne: Interesting
27/06/17, 12:44 - Janith: I presume it's because I started really going into science at around 7. So all the new info might have pushed the memories into obscurity
27/06/17, 12:44 - Didier: Wait,even before 12?
27/06/17, 12:44 - Janith: No videos 😂
27/06/17, 12:44 - Didier: Possible
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: Cuz I rmb my life as life events
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: Which makes it easier to rmb
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: But difficult if I don't recall a significant event in that time period
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: Might be similar for u
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: Eh 😂
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: Pictures?
27/06/17, 12:45 - Didier: My mom loves to take them
27/06/17, 12:46 - Janith: Though I must admit that it does pose problems. If you can't look back very well then it becomes hard to feel for your loved ones. Cause the memories that would normally solidify the bond are inaccessible
27/06/17, 12:46 - Janith: Tried them. Minimal effect
27/06/17, 12:46 - Didier: Yep u r right
27/06/17, 12:46 - Didier: That's why I can't imagine how those with amnesia struggle
27/06/17, 12:46 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 12:47 - Didier: I'm always so curious of that
27/06/17, 12:47 - Didier: U mean u still don't rmb?
27/06/17, 12:47 - Arne: I remember at least 5 fragments of me being 4 y/o
27/06/17, 12:47 - Janith: Well... I can't say completely but you end up feeling like shit sometimes
27/06/17, 12:47 - Didier: Maybe cuz u did not do it along the way
27/06/17, 12:48 - Didier: It does not work if u try to recall all at once
27/06/17, 12:48 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 12:48 - Didier: I rmb I was a naive kid
27/06/17, 12:48 - Janith: People remember all the memories of you but you can't bring up any emotions. You just know that you should care
27/06/17, 12:48 - Arne: Can those late memories be there because you wasn't at that point self-aware enough?
27/06/17, 12:48 - Arne: Me too
27/06/17, 12:49 - Didier: A naive and curious one at that haha
27/06/17, 12:49 - Arne: Curious... Idk if I was
27/06/17, 12:49 - Janith: I think that's the case. I didn't look back till I was past 16 😂
27/06/17, 12:49 - Arne: But at least. My mom says so about that.
27/06/17, 12:49 - Didier: Wow u need to keep more photobooks then
27/06/17, 12:49 - Arne: We where always outside looking for little spiders, or other animals.
27/06/17, 12:50 - Didier: Spiders,thank god we dun rlly have them here
27/06/17, 12:50 - Didier: I think she's right
27/06/17, 12:50 - Janith: I try to avoid photos. Remembering makes me uncomfortable
27/06/17, 12:50 - Didier: Try to keep them now?
27/06/17, 12:50 - Janith: I prefer looking forward to looking back
27/06/17, 12:50 - Didier: U can take pics with ur own phone now
27/06/17, 12:51 - Didier: Keep it to recall stuff
27/06/17, 12:51 - Didier: See how it works
27/06/17, 12:51 - Didier: Haha true
27/06/17, 12:51 - Janith: I know it's gonna end up being bad for me but... Eh
27/06/17, 12:51 - Arne: Here aren't dangerous spiders too, but until I was like eleven, I had no problems with spiders. We even searched for the bigger ones. (2 cm 😂). But when I was eleven a cross spider bit me, so me and my brother were frightened. 
And since that day I am afraid of 'em
27/06/17, 12:51 - Didier: Looking back sometimes is fun cuz it's funny though
27/06/17, 12:52 - Didier: I bet u r still more brave than me
27/06/17, 12:52 - Didier: Is it just me but girls r more afraid of spiders
27/06/17, 12:52 - Didier: most girls
27/06/17, 12:52 - Janith: Looking back is an essential part of being human. It helps reinforce memories and social bonds
27/06/17, 12:52 - Arne: I can't say.
27/06/17, 12:52 - Didier: Oh yes.Do take more pics when u have a gf 😂
27/06/17, 12:53 - Janith: They are but I don't know if it's social conditioning or something biological
27/06/17, 12:53 - Didier: There r more feelers in girls too
27/06/17, 12:53 - Janith: Relationships are a pain man 😂
27/06/17, 12:53 - Didier: Where is Maureen now
27/06/17, 12:54 - Didier: I wanna ask her if she is afraid of spiders
27/06/17, 12:54 - Didier: I'm just afraid of creepy crawlies
27/06/17, 12:54 - Arne: And woman see colors more bright
27/06/17, 12:54 - Janith: That's cause of hormones though.
27/06/17, 12:54 - Didier: A healthy relationship is fun so no worries 😂
27/06/17, 12:54 - Janith: @4915127175996 how are you with Arachnaphobia?
27/06/17, 12:55 - Didier: Black spiders seem worse in my opinion?
27/06/17, 12:55 - Didier: Relationships take time to build tho
27/06/17, 12:55 - Arne: The poison obe
27/06/17, 12:55 - Janith: Oh I know. I've been in one. As long as my girlfriend is mildly sociopathic I'm good 😂
27/06/17, 12:55 - Arne: One? *
27/06/17, 12:55 - Didier: That's y it's a pain
27/06/17, 12:55 - Didier: Y is that so O.o
27/06/17, 12:56 - Didier: Are u perhaps masochistic
27/06/17, 12:56 - Arne: Is this a hint Didier?
27/06/17, 12:56 - Didier: What?
27/06/17, 12:56 - Arne: Haha nothing
27/06/17, 12:56 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 12:56 - Janith: Spiders with smaller builds are more dangerous I think. They're more likely to be venomous
27/06/17, 12:56 - Didier: I think biological
27/06/17, 12:57 - Arne: There are jump spiders
27/06/17, 12:57 - Didier: But big spiders look intimidating
27/06/17, 12:57 - Maureen: I don't have arachnophobia, only agoraphobia
27/06/17, 12:57 - Janith: Haha no. I'm just kinda sociopathic myself. I dated an INFP once and we used to have a lot of fights because I couldn't empathize
27/06/17, 12:57 - Didier: Really?I heard Australia has many creatures
27/06/17, 12:57 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 12:57 - Didier: Really?Why sociopathic though 🤔
27/06/17, 12:59 - Janith: Australia has a ton of things that can kill you in a hurry
27/06/17, 12:59 - Didier: But yes I think there r more thinkers as sociopaths/psychopaths
27/06/17, 12:59 - Janith: I don't know. Just know that I have trouble with empathy
27/06/17, 12:59 - Arne: You can crick your empathy up with reading books
27/06/17, 12:59 - Didier: Haha agoraphobia is getting to me now
27/06/17, 13:00 - Didier: It's a weird phobia
27/06/17, 13:00 - Janith: Sociopaths more than psychopaths. Psychopaths lack planning
27/06/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Same again here
27/06/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I read tons of books. Nothing happens
27/06/17, 13:00 - Janith: It doesn't help.
27/06/17, 13:00 - Arne: What kind of books?
27/06/17, 13:00 - Didier: Isn't it sociopaths that lack planning?
27/06/17, 13:00 - Janith: @919426153395 we should be friends 😂
27/06/17, 13:01 - Didier: Jash Janith Jash Janith
27/06/17, 13:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Damn right we should 😂
27/06/17, 13:01 - Janith: No its psychopaths. They can't perceive consequences
27/06/17, 13:01 - Janith: Psychopaths are born. Sociopaths are made
27/06/17, 13:02 - Arne: I heard it was a fact. But maybe your empathy stuck
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 13:03 - Arne: And about that fact, even a writer told us lmao
27/06/17, 13:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: All kinds of non-fiction. But I love the ones concerning psychology and strategy and stuff
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: Idk I read up on them before
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: Sociopaths r the impulsive ones
27/06/17, 13:03 - Janith: Same 😂
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: I notice most serial killers hit their head before
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: Or anything else as it says uere
27/06/17, 13:03 - Didier: Abuse,neglect
27/06/17, 13:04 - Didier: Yeah but it's psychopaths that plan
27/06/17, 13:04 - Didier: Maybe u forgot haha
27/06/17, 13:04 - Arne: Ah okay
27/06/17, 13:04 - Arne: I have to eat guys. C you all later
27/06/17, 13:05 - Didier: Yep cya
27/06/17, 13:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Hahah
27/06/17, 13:05 - Didier: Wait who is the one who said
27/06/17, 13:05 - Didier: They dated an INFP before
27/06/17, 13:06 - Janith: https://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/psychopath/psychopath-vs-sociopath-what-s-the-difference/
27/06/17, 13:06 - Janith: Err... Conflicting data :/
27/06/17, 13:06 - Janith: And that was me 🙋‍♂
27/06/17, 13:06 - Janith: @919426153395 have you read the lucifer effect?
27/06/17, 13:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yusssss
27/06/17, 13:07 - Janith: I'm reading it now. It's awesome!!
27/06/17, 13:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I must say
27/06/17, 13:08 - Didier: Find one with a stronger thinking function.Thankfully it can always be developed,I learned it the hard way
27/06/17, 13:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's one of the best books I ever read
27/06/17, 13:08 - Janith: Also gonna be pretty useful in the future
27/06/17, 13:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I also love "war" by Robert Greene
27/06/17, 13:08 - Janith: Agreed
27/06/17, 13:08 - Janith: I'll check out war
27/06/17, 13:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Heck I love all of Robert Green's books
27/06/17, 13:08 - Didier: Cuz thinkers r feelers r not opposites
27/06/17, 13:08 - Didier: They r just not always complementary
27/06/17, 13:09 - Didier: and*
27/06/17, 13:09 - Janith: My mom and brother are both infps with strong thinking functions
27/06/17, 13:09 - Didier: Wow
27/06/17, 13:09 - Didier: How is it?
27/06/17, 13:09 - Didier: Mine are both sensing judging types it annoys me lol
27/06/17, 13:09 - Didier: That's rare
27/06/17, 13:10 - Janith: My mom is worried about my mental health 😂
She acts like your typical infp when I get sociopathic.
27/06/17, 13:10 - Janith: My brother is curious about it
27/06/17, 13:10 - Didier: They know u r an INTP?
27/06/17, 13:11 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 13:11 - Didier: 😂 they r nice right?
27/06/17, 13:11 - Janith: I had this conversation with him. Regarding my interest in going on killing sprees in watch dogs 2
27/06/17, 13:11 - Janith: Yes they know and yes they're pretty nice
27/06/17, 13:12 - Didier: I need an INFP mother haha
27/06/17, 13:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol pretty much everyone does that
27/06/17, 13:12 - Didier: Do yall have conflicts here and there?
27/06/17, 13:12 - Didier: If so,why?
27/06/17, 13:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: All the time
27/06/17, 13:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: All the fucking time
27/06/17, 13:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's like my life is a huge conflict
27/06/17, 13:13 - Janith: Yeah but I normally don't in other games. Because civilians are like machines in those
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: I just can't get a long with sensors
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: Mainly
27/06/17, 13:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I constantly get those who take a shot at me
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: Sensing and judging type is the worst
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: INFJ,I get a long with them
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: I'll never date a sensor ever again
27/06/17, 13:13 - Janith: I like watch dogs 2 because it gives the civilians a life. The profiler gives you a glimpse into their incomes and their lives
27/06/17, 13:13 - Didier: Bad experiences
27/06/17, 13:14 - Janith: That's my father 😂
27/06/17, 13:14 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 13:14 - Janith: I probably won't date a sensor either
27/06/17, 13:14 - Didier: Mine r ESFJ and ISFJ
27/06/17, 13:14 - Didier: They can't understand me and I can't understand them
27/06/17, 13:14 - Janith: Depending on how they are
27/06/17, 13:14 - Didier: So I can't stand xSFJs
27/06/17, 13:14 - Didier: How about u?
27/06/17, 13:14 - Janith: Yikes. That must make life miserable
27/06/17, 13:15 - Didier: Yeah...
27/06/17, 13:15 - Janith: Same. My father tends to lean to that side
27/06/17, 13:15 - Didier: Worse still,they r feeling types
27/06/17, 13:15 - Janith: Though I will admit that they're pretty useful
27/06/17, 13:15 - Didier: What do u mean?
27/06/17, 13:15 - Didier: The only way they r useful to me is
27/06/17, 13:15 - Didier: Get the work done and being alert
27/06/17, 13:16 - Janith: They're more likely to take up something for you while you focus on something that interests you
27/06/17, 13:16 - Janith: Also doing mundane stuff
27/06/17, 13:16 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 13:16 - Janith: Precisely. You don't have to worry about the boring stuff. They do it almost automatically
27/06/17, 13:16 - Didier: Mine r always blabbing around though
27/06/17, 13:16 - Didier: They r very noisy 😂
27/06/17, 13:17 - Didier: Usually
27/06/17, 13:17 - Didier: Hahaha
27/06/17, 13:17 - Didier: I notice the judging function is fine
27/06/17, 13:17 - Didier: It's mainly the sensing
27/06/17, 13:18 - Janith: And @919426153395 I mean that just killing faceless npcs is boring (for me) 
Personally I need to know who I'm taking out. It makes it fun
27/06/17, 13:18 - Didier: The only friendships that lasted for me is with an infp and infj
27/06/17, 13:18 - Janith: Curious. What type are you @6582280971?
27/06/17, 13:18 - Didier: The one with intj,isfj and isfp failed
27/06/17, 13:19 - Didier: Infp with a strong thinking function xD
27/06/17, 13:19 - Janith: Why did they fail? If I may ask
27/06/17, 13:19 - Didier: Intj they were too
27/06/17, 13:19 - Didier: Narcissistic
27/06/17, 13:19 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Might not get into any relationship at all😂
27/06/17, 13:19 - Didier: Isfj she was self-absorbed though she did not realise
27/06/17, 13:19 - Didier: They focus on the past a lot
27/06/17, 13:20 - Janith: I knew I sensed a feeler 😂
27/06/17, 13:20 - Didier: Isfp,u get a long with them but
27/06/17, 13:20 - Spaceexplorer: Same here too.. Entp as well
27/06/17, 13:20 - Didier: Not much talking because of their sensing function
27/06/17, 13:20 - Didier: along*
27/06/17, 13:20 - Didier: 😂thanks
27/06/17, 13:21 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: INFJ are the best fit for an INTP
27/06/17, 13:21 - Didier: U mean u have INFP and INFJ friendships?Or only ENTP so far?
27/06/17, 13:21 - Didier: I heard so
27/06/17, 13:21 - Janith: I think people like you belong in positions with political power
27/06/17, 13:21 - Didier: Have yall met one before?
27/06/17, 13:21 - Janith: Met what one?
27/06/17, 13:21 - Spaceexplorer: Infp,infj and entp are the ones im closest to
27/06/17, 13:21 - Didier: Why is that so?I'm curious haha.I want to,for the better,though I have not much interest for it
27/06/17, 13:22 - Didier: They r the best
27/06/17, 13:22 - Didier: Infj
27/06/17, 13:22 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Yeah but she didn't want cause I'm always lost and not much of a talker
27/06/17, 13:23 - Janith: INFP so good for social welfare. Strong thinking functions so can look at things logically. Both qualities needed for a good government
27/06/17, 13:23 - Janith: My cousin
27/06/17, 13:23 - Didier: Oh yeah
27/06/17, 13:23 - Didier: The only problem would be
27/06/17, 13:23 - Didier: How to get political power hahaah
27/06/17, 13:23 - Didier: No support xD
27/06/17, 13:23 - Didier: So it's true u get along?
27/06/17, 13:23 - Janith: Nearly impossible for types as genuine as infps
27/06/17, 13:24 - Janith: We get along well but most of the time we don't interact much
27/06/17, 13:24 - Arne: True. But even sometimes I got it.
27/06/17, 13:24 - Didier: True
27/06/17, 13:25 - Didier: I think it's possible if we have a trusted right hand man though
27/06/17, 13:25 - Janith: I gotta go guys. Have a good day/night
27/06/17, 13:25 - Janith: I volunteer 🙋‍♂
27/06/17, 13:25 - Didier: Same for u.Bye :)
27/06/17, 13:25 - Didier: Haha thanks so much
27/06/17, 13:25 - Didier: I will remember u
27/06/17, 13:25 - Janith: I like manipulation 😂
27/06/17, 13:26 - Janith: (I know I know I'm a horrible person)
27/06/17, 13:26 - Didier: It's fine
27/06/17, 13:26 - Didier: Manipulation is interesting
27/06/17, 13:26 - Didier: Sadists like them
27/06/17, 13:26 - Didier: Maybe u r one
27/06/17, 13:26 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 13:27 - Didier: So,that was a false statement? 😂
27/06/17, 13:27 - Janith: I'm not a sadist either. I don't enjoy giving pain. I just enjoy messing with variables
27/06/17, 13:27 - Janith: Especially in people
27/06/17, 13:27 - Didier: Variables?
27/06/17, 13:27 - Didier: I might call that curious
27/06/17, 13:28 - Janith: Yes. Curious. But I have a really weird moral compass
27/06/17, 13:28 - Didier: We'll see how weird it is
27/06/17, 13:28 - Janith: Anyway. TTYL
27/06/17, 13:28 - Didier: Anyway,so u were messing with me? 😂
27/06/17, 13:28 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Most of my classmates are sensors and it's horrible and not fun at all
27/06/17, 13:28 - Didier: Yep ttyl
27/06/17, 13:29 - Didier: I think u need to find a sensor
27/06/17, 13:29 - Didier: With strong intuition side
27/06/17, 13:29 - Didier: Then it will be fun
27/06/17, 13:32 - Didier: Haha I read that wrongly.Forget about this.
27/06/17, 13:32 - Didier: Yes help me.I need someone manipulative as mt right-hand man.Thank you very much 😌
27/06/17, 13:35 - Janith: Aaand I'm back! 😂
27/06/17, 13:35 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 13:35 - Didier: That was um
27/06/17, 13:35 - Didier: Fast?
27/06/17, 13:35 - Janith: Technically though this is later
27/06/17, 13:35 - Didier: Did u go to the toilet or
27/06/17, 13:35 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 13:36 - Janith: Just had to shower 😂
27/06/17, 13:36 - Didier: Wait,u shower that fast?
27/06/17, 13:36 - Janith: I was fast?
27/06/17, 13:36 - Didier: Yeah
27/06/17, 13:36 - Didier: Did u perhaps just
27/06/17, 13:36 - Didier: Rinse with water
27/06/17, 13:37 - Janith: Oh cool. And I don't have soap in my ear this time either
27/06/17, 13:37 - Janith: I call that an achievement 😂
27/06/17, 13:37 - Didier: Btw,an INFP with an INTP as political leaders,
27/06/17, 13:37 - Didier: Interesting
27/06/17, 13:37 - Didier: Can't wait for this to happen
27/06/17, 13:37 - Janith: I can see quite a lot not getting done... But that's politics 😂
27/06/17, 13:37 - Didier: U must have big ear holes
27/06/17, 13:38 - Didier: 😂oh yes
27/06/17, 13:38 - Janith: No. I just forget most of the time 😅
27/06/17, 13:38 - Didier: I can imagine us procrastinating
27/06/17, 13:38 - Janith: Shower thoughts are too interesting 😂
27/06/17, 13:38 - Didier: Wow haha
27/06/17, 13:38 - Didier: I agree
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: In the shower
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: I suddenly become this genius
27/06/17, 13:39 - Janith: Though in all honesty I think a good sensor would become a pretty good leader too
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: Then I always wonder why can't I be the same at other times
27/06/17, 13:39 - Arne: I only get that by cycling home after school
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: Yep
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: I'm not sure but
27/06/17, 13:39 - Didier: I think many of the leaders were sensors?
27/06/17, 13:40 - Didier: U must be good at cycling?
27/06/17, 13:40 - Janith: I've always felt that intuitives should be given a "do what you will" position
27/06/17, 13:41 - Arne: I can cycle without using hands
27/06/17, 13:41 - Janith: A lot of the great thinkers and artists have been Ns
27/06/17, 13:41 - Arne: Since my 9th
27/06/17, 13:41 - Janith: Wow. I tried that once.... I don't anymore
27/06/17, 13:41 - Janith: 😅
27/06/17, 13:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I Personally like setting up traps and driving ncps into them
27/06/17, 13:42 - Arne: Never fell down while cycling without using hands. I'm proud of it
27/06/17, 13:42 - Arne: Rip
27/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: There were INTP political leaders but
27/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: For INFP I'm not sure
27/06/17, 13:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I go on creating newer and more complicated ones which I would in the real world if not for my clash with morality
27/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: INFP r natural leaders thougj
27/06/17, 13:42 - Didier: I can imagine Jesus being one
27/06/17, 13:43 - Didier: Need to read up more on his stories to judge
27/06/17, 13:43 - Janith: I like that too. But sometimes I prefer the more direct approach. Depends on how I'm feeling. What's your favorite game to kill people?
27/06/17, 13:43 - Didier: He was definitely a INFx
27/06/17, 13:43 - Arne: The stories about hem are just stories.
27/06/17, 13:43 - Didier: Yeah
27/06/17, 13:43 - Arne: The change that it will tell the real Jesus is little.
27/06/17, 13:44 - Didier: Exactly
27/06/17, 13:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: GTA 5 has a lot of tools
27/06/17, 13:44 - Janith: My problem with the real world is in preparation time and cleaning costs. I just have better things to do right now
27/06/17, 13:44 - Didier: Pk?
27/06/17, 13:44 - Janith: Jesus and Buddha are both infps. Buddha I'm sure about
27/06/17, 13:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How old are you Janith?
27/06/17, 13:44 - Didier: True
27/06/17, 13:44 - Didier: It's interesting tho haha
27/06/17, 13:45 - Janith: What's pk?
27/06/17, 13:45 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 13:45 - Janith: 19 . you?
27/06/17, 13:45 - Didier: I'm not sure about buddha but
27/06/17, 13:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 17
27/06/17, 13:45 - Didier: U know guan ying?
27/06/17, 13:45 - Didier: Player kill
27/06/17, 13:46 - Janith: I don't get what you were asking 😅
27/06/17, 13:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Never heard
27/06/17, 13:46 - Didier: I thought we were the same- It's fine haha
27/06/17, 13:46 - Didier: Only in some games
27/06/17, 13:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I oughta check it out
27/06/17, 13:47 - Didier: Since u said buddha might be an infp
27/06/17, 13:47 - Didier: How was he like?
27/06/17, 13:47 - Janith: Oh you mean pvp. No I wasn't talking about that
27/06/17, 13:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Ohhhhhhh pvp. I thought there's something called player kill Idk about 😂
27/06/17, 13:47 - Didier: Sort of I think
27/06/17, 13:48 - Janith: I mean for example in watch dogs 2 there was this one woman who was working as a waitress and had just got a scholarship for college. The npcs seemed more human in that game
27/06/17, 13:48 - Didier: I think they call it diff names too haha
27/06/17, 13:48 - Janith: His main goal was to remove suffering of all. He preached endless mercy
27/06/17, 13:49 - Janith: And other very infp stuff
27/06/17, 13:49 - Didier: What games do yall recommend when I get my psvita at the end of the year?
27/06/17, 13:49 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Removing suffering = removing stupidity
27/06/17, 13:49 - Didier: Endless mercy?
27/06/17, 13:49 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And that's not really possible
27/06/17, 13:50 - Didier: Can cfm it's INF already
27/06/17, 13:50 - Janith: Hmm.. I'm not sure. What genres do you enjoy?
27/06/17, 13:50 - Didier: Yes hahaha
27/06/17, 13:50 - Didier: Rpg games
27/06/17, 13:50 - Didier: A lot actually
27/06/17, 13:50 - Janith: In his case there's a whole lot of things about reincarnation and stuff. Really long story
27/06/17, 13:51 - Didier: Graphics r important
27/06/17, 13:52 - Janith: Umm.. Disgaea 4 maybe. I haven't played in the vita
27/06/17, 13:53 - Didier: What is it about?
27/06/17, 13:53 - Janith: Dunno 😂
27/06/17, 13:54 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 13:54 - Janith: Though I heard good things about the series some time back
27/06/17, 13:54 - Janith: Google says 4 is the most recent for vita
27/06/17, 13:54 - Janith: 5 is only available for ps4
27/06/17, 13:54 - Didier: U played before tho?
27/06/17, 13:55 - Janith: Nope. I played some psp games on my phone and heard about it then

27/06/17, 13:58 - Didier: So this time u played it before?Ok will check it out
27/06/17, 14:00 - Janith: I use the ball as a soundboard for some of my thoughts
27/06/17, 14:00 - Didier: 😂
27/06/17, 14:00 - Didier: I can imagine it's funny
27/06/17, 14:01 - Didier: U will have a soundboard that can reply u next time

27/06/17, 14:01 - Didier: Haha
27/06/17, 14:02 - Janith: But he's annoying sometimes
27/06/17, 14:02 - Didier: Annoying bob
27/06/17, 14:02 - Janith: Though I presume it's because it's a simple name
27/06/17, 14:02 - Didier: With an annoyingly cute face
27/06/17, 14:02 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
27/06/17, 14:02 - Didier: Tom yum is my favourite
27/06/17, 14:03 - Didier: When u eat spicy food,non-spicy food becomes bland

27/06/17, 14:05 - Didier: But u know,I don't

27/06/17, 14:05 - Didier: We have coursework,which is 60%,and is supposed to show our planning
27/06/17, 14:06 - Janith: Wait a sec. Would you mind if we switched to private chat? I don't think it's appropriate to fill up everyone else's inboxes with normal conversation 😂
27/06/17, 14:06 - Didier: Haha 😂
27/06/17, 14:06 - Didier: I don't mind
27/06/17, 14:06 - Didier: I wonder if they actually mind
27/06/17, 14:06 - Didier: Ok pm me then

28/06/17, 08:43 - Janith: What areas do you have experience in?
28/06/17, 10:16 - Juancho: Greetings
28/06/17, 10:16 - Juancho: @94754191589 I'm looking forward to another intellectual discussion today
28/06/17, 10:59 - Janith: Sorry @50494800614. I'm sick today so I can't do too much heavy thinking
28/06/17, 11:00 - Janith: I'm gonna spend most of the day in space Engine. Exploring the universe
28/06/17, 11:44 - Juancho: Hahaha
28/06/17, 11:44 - Juancho: I've been meaning to purchase ksp
28/06/17, 11:54 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
28/06/17, 11:54 - Janith: Space engine is free actually
28/06/17, 11:54 - Janith: You can't really build rockets but you caan explore a 1:1 scale universe
28/06/17, 11:55 - Janith: I just went from Mars to Proxima Centauri
28/06/17, 11:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I want that!!!!
28/06/17, 11:58 - Janith: You can download it. It's only 1gb
28/06/17, 11:59 - Janith: Though I should warn you. Using a spaceship to get around is incredibly tedious
28/06/17, 11:59 - Juancho: What kind of spacecraft are you doing your voyage in?
28/06/17, 11:59 - Janith: I just free roam most of the time
28/06/17, 11:59 - Juancho: You traveled 4.22 light years
28/06/17, 11:59 - Janith: Unknown. But it can bend spacetime somehow :/
28/06/17, 12:00 - Janith: Nice effects too. You can see spacetime curving as you go into warp
28/06/17, 12:01 - Janith: Other similar games you guys might like are ksp(obviously) and universe sandbox 2
28/06/17, 12:01 - Janith: The last one can be a blast if you want to smash planets together
28/06/17, 12:01 - Janith: Or make the sun go supernova
28/06/17, 12:02 - Juancho: Fuck. That'd be cool af to see.
28/06/17, 12:02 - FABIO: space engineers
28/06/17, 12:02 - FABIO: you can build a fucking orbital canon
28/06/17, 12:02 - Arne: Rip earth
28/06/17, 12:02 - Juancho: What do you mean? All objects warp space-time
28/06/17, 12:02 - Janith: It is! Though kinda worrying 😂
28/06/17, 12:02 - Juancho: Hahahahwh
28/06/17, 12:02 - Janith: How's the optimization on the new versions? The version I checked out sucked
28/06/17, 12:03 - FABIO: yeah.. dont know
28/06/17, 12:03 - Janith: You gotta see it
28/06/17, 12:03 - FABIO: long time since a played
28/06/17, 12:04 - Juancho: Long time since I played pretty much any video game
28/06/17, 12:04 - Arne: I play CoC 😂
28/06/17, 12:05 - Janith: I've been mostly playing these days. Not gonna get many chances after university starts
28/06/17, 12:05 - Juancho: Last games I played were Shadow of Mordor, Horizon Zero Dawn and GTA V
28/06/17, 12:05 - Janith: I don't play that cause they try to use every trick in the book to try and get you to pay
28/06/17, 12:05 - Janith: Plus it lacks strategy
28/06/17, 12:06 - Juancho: True
28/06/17, 12:06 - Arne: I don't get that feeling when I played it.
28/06/17, 12:06 - Arne: Play*
28/06/17, 12:06 - Janith: Shadow of war is coming out this year. Expanded nemesis system too
28/06/17, 12:07 - Janith: The gameplay footage looks quite interesting. The system was scaled way up and they added elements of strategy into the game too
28/06/17, 12:07 - Janith: Really?.. It seemed that way to me. Guess it's because I might have been trying to compare it with starcraft 2 😅
28/06/17, 12:08 - Juancho: I KNOW. I'm buying: Shadow of War, South Park's A Fractured Butthole, COD, Destiny, Battlefront 2 and the new Assassin's Creed
28/06/17, 12:08 - Juancho: You have got to buy Assassin's Creed
28/06/17, 12:08 - Arne: New assassins creed looks cool, my brother has it
28/06/17, 12:08 - Juancho: It came out already?
28/06/17, 12:08 - Janith: The new one?
28/06/17, 12:08 - FABIO: guys.. i scored 9.6 of 10 in my exam yesterday
28/06/17, 12:08 - FABIO: digital circuits
28/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: FUCK YEAH
28/06/17, 12:09 - Juancho: The one in egypt
28/06/17, 12:09 - Arne: but can you explain why you think that? Maybe you are right.
28/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: teatcher came to tell me via facebook...
28/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: hahahahaah
28/06/17, 12:09 - Janith: It's "the fractured but whole" 😂
28/06/17, 12:09 - Juancho: Hahaha tight
28/06/17, 12:09 - Juancho: Right
28/06/17, 12:09 - Janith: CONGRATULATIONS!!
28/06/17, 12:10 - FABIO: thanks. =D
28/06/17, 12:10 - Janith: Origins wasn't released yet right? October was the release date
28/06/17, 12:10 - Arne: The one with trains and stuff
28/06/17, 12:10 - Juancho: @94754191589 Maybe you can help me determine of I have the right diode for an experiment i'm doing? I'll send the the details by PM
28/06/17, 12:10 - Juancho: That's what I was trying to tell @31625147850
28/06/17, 12:10 - Arne: Oops wrong tagged
28/06/17, 12:11 - Juancho: No, that's syndicate.
28/06/17, 12:11 - Arne: 😅😅
28/06/17, 12:11 - Juancho: Which btw is also a great game
28/06/17, 12:11 - Janith: The timers, the lack of planning. The resource system etc etc
28/06/17, 12:11 - Janith: I can't stand assassin's creed anymore 😅
28/06/17, 12:11 - Janith: And @50494800614 sure thing. I don't know if I can help but I'll try
28/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: bugsoft
28/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: i hate them
28/06/17, 12:12 - Janith: The gameplay elements are nice and all but I've grown to hate the simple good guy vs. Bad guy narrative
28/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: they FUCKED UP HARD for honor
28/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: :(
28/06/17, 12:12 - Arne: Hmm, I can see what you mean. But most players will just gem (indeed) there buildings, or upgrade it with gems. But you can get 5 builders not that difficult if you wait for the gems.
28/06/17, 12:13 - Janith: And this. Almost didn't get watch dogs 2 simply because ubisoft 😅
28/06/17, 12:13 - Juancho: Watch Dogs & Watch Dogs 2 are fucking great
28/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: dont like the physics in the first one
28/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: 2 never played
28/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: and never will
28/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: its bugsoft game
28/06/17, 12:14 - Janith: The introduction of gems and the ability to buy not just resources but build times, upgrades and shields mean that there almost no strategy left
28/06/17, 12:14 - Juancho: Ahahahaha right. The skidding of the cars was absurd.
28/06/17, 12:14 - Janith: Physics in the first one suck. 2 isn't amazing in that regard either. But overall I find 2 to be a lot more enjoyable
28/06/17, 12:15 - Janith: Still. It's a last resort game
28/06/17, 12:15 - FABIO: i love how he prints a shotgun
28/06/17, 12:15 - Janith: Money is best spend elsewhere
28/06/17, 12:15 - FABIO: in minutes
28/06/17, 12:15 - Arne: True, there is not much strategy left.
28/06/17, 12:15 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/06/17, 12:15 - FABIO: i really liked that
28/06/17, 12:16 - Arne: Anyone ever heard about Arctic Combat?
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: Never mind that. He makes a drone too!!
28/06/17, 12:16 - FABIO: he prints a drone?
28/06/17, 12:16 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: With the circuits, rotors and everything
28/06/17, 12:16 - FABIO: LOL
28/06/17, 12:16 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: TWO DRONES!! 🙋‍♂
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: *😂
28/06/17, 12:16 - FABIO: guys have you played... my summer car?
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: What's that?
28/06/17, 12:16 - Janith: And that too?
28/06/17, 12:17 - FABIO: its a game where you have tu build your car.. FROM 0
28/06/17, 12:17 - FABIO: really.. really hard
28/06/17, 12:17 - Juancho: He printed a fucking drone that can fly at like 10,000ft
28/06/17, 12:17 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
28/06/17, 12:17 - FABIO: awesome.
28/06/17, 12:17 - Arne: It was a shooter game, it was really cool but they stopped. Just wondering if anyone know the game. There where even completely knife games in there. Graphics weren't that bad
28/06/17, 12:18 - Janith: Yikes.. Seems more like automobile engineer simulator 😅
28/06/17, 12:18 - Janith: I haven't heard of it
28/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: yes...
28/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: mine didnt worked
28/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: i spende 3 days building that shit
28/06/17, 12:18 - Janith: What are your favorite games guys?
28/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: when i turned on
28/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: FUCKING EXPLODED
28/06/17, 12:19 - Juancho: hahahahahahaha
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: dark souls... witcher 3
28/06/17, 12:19 - Janith: What... Err.. Okay how?
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: and
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: FACTORIO
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: FACTORIO IS LIFE
28/06/17, 12:19 - Janith: I knew you'd say this 😂
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: hahaha
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: every engineer loves that game
28/06/17, 12:19 - Arne: Probably because your first two letters are the same as the game, and the the last two too
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: now they have URANIUM
28/06/17, 12:19 - FABIO: AND NUCLEAR ENERGY
28/06/17, 12:20 - FABIO: i can build a nuclear bomb....
28/06/17, 12:20 - FABIO: and bomb the shit out of that hole called planet
28/06/17, 12:20 - Juancho: Man, I simply can not stress this enough. These games need more fucking money. These games are great, imagine what they could accomplish with the GTA budget.
28/06/17, 12:20 - Janith: I've kind of hit a slump after playing dark souls 3, the Witcher 3 and Nier: Automata in that order
28/06/17, 12:20 - Arne: Risk is a nice game!!
28/06/17, 12:20 - Janith: Now no game seems even remotely interesting 😂
28/06/17, 12:20 - FABIO: yeah
28/06/17, 12:21 - FABIO: had it with witcher
28/06/17, 12:21 - FABIO: im specting for CYBERPUNK 2077
28/06/17, 12:21 - FABIO: same company that did witcher 3
28/06/17, 12:21 - Janith: I swear when they release cyberpunk I'm gonna lock myself up in a room for a week 😂
28/06/17, 12:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why is mount and blade warband so addictive?
28/06/17, 12:21 - FABIO: did you guys knew... that the autor of the witchers book... gave the cd project the autorization to use his books in the game
28/06/17, 12:21 - FABIO: FOR a small price
28/06/17, 12:21 - Janith: CD Projekt Red are gods
28/06/17, 12:22 - FABIO: 👆🏻
28/06/17, 12:22 - Janith: I heard. Dumbest decision made by a writer since the dawn of time?
28/06/17, 12:22 - FABIO: tottally
28/06/17, 12:22 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/06/17, 12:22 - Janith: It just is!
28/06/17, 12:22 - Janith: Play carribean too. It's like Mount and blade but with pirates
28/06/17, 12:23 - Janith: And piratey stuff
28/06/17, 12:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Just 'Carribean'?
28/06/17, 12:23 - Janith: Oops. Blood and gold carribean
28/06/17, 12:23 - Janith: *carribean!
28/06/17, 12:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
28/06/17, 12:23 - Janith: There's an exclamation mark in the name too
28/06/17, 12:24 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'll check it out

28/06/17, 13:45 - Arne: Hearthstone
28/06/17, 14:05 - Lulu: Hey hey how is everyone
28/06/17, 14:06 - Lulu: Why the hell does the whatsapp camera make everything look better than any other camera on my phone
28/06/17, 14:07 - Lulu: Lol
28/06/17, 14:15 - FABIO: The code
28/06/17, 14:15 - FABIO: They have an diffrent algorithm to it

28/06/17, 14:24 - Lulu: Snap is okay, sometimes it's weird but good most of the time
28/06/17, 14:35 - Juancho: Thanks to my INTP overthinking trait
28/06/17, 14:35 - Juancho: I was stressed for like an hour
28/06/17, 14:36 - Juancho: I am converting the Schrödinger equation into Hamiltonian form
28/06/17, 14:36 - Juancho: I committed a novice blunder
28/06/17, 14:37 - Juancho: Overthought the whole thing
28/06/17, 14:37 - Juancho: Didn't notice the blunder until I was about to give up
28/06/17, 14:38 - Maureen: I have the best ideas when I'm about to give up or when I already did
28/06/17, 14:39 - Juancho: Hahaha ik
28/06/17, 14:39 - Juancho: Has happened to me once or twice
28/06/17, 14:39 - Juancho: It's rather annoying
28/06/17, 14:43 - Maureen: Like when I analysed Orphan Black which bases on greek mythology. I was wondering why they named a scorpion "Pupok" which is Navel in Ukrainian (the character who saw the scorpion is ukrainian). I was walking around a weird stone who used to be the navel of the world and gave up. But the other day I saw a documentary about the Oracle of Delphi and they said it was the navel of the greek universe. which would make total sense in the Orphan Black Universe because there is a character named Delphine (whoever believes in coincidences should not watch this show)
28/06/17, 14:46 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
28/06/17, 14:46 - FABIO: They put me in charge of the printer at the university

28/06/17, 15:02 - Juancho: Not that long
28/06/17, 15:02 - FABIO: Depends on the speed

28/06/17, 15:23 - Arne: True

28/06/17, 19:45 - Juancho: He's like 11 and he's working
28/06/17, 19:45 - Juancho: On complex electronics
28/06/17, 19:45 - Juancho: Not even by reading but by thinking

29/06/17, 04:12 - Amin: Ive read the series 3 times, I cant remember how many times I watched the movie when I was high, but my point is, the last book actually sucks
29/06/17, 04:13 - Amin: Sounds nice, there is a tv series called da vinci's demons, da vinci does the same thing that the book you mentioned does
29/06/17, 04:14 - Amin: In that tv show
29/06/17, 04:14 - Amin: .
29/06/17, 04:15 - Arne: I saw one or two episodes. But I was only 13, so it wasn't anything for me

29/06/17, 13:43 - Janith: Seems incredibly strange
29/06/17, 14:07 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>

29/06/17, 14:25 - Arne: Ikr, I immediately put it private
29/06/17, 14:48 - Janith: Glad I don't use it
29/06/17, 15:14 - Amin: Do you want some info? 😂😂
29/06/17, 15:15 - Janith: Info regarding?
29/06/17, 15:15 - Amin: Information, like dna
29/06/17, 15:15 - Janith: Well... Follow up studies are needed in order to be sure
29/06/17, 15:16 - Amin: 😂😂😂
29/06/17, 15:16 - Amin: Seriously, Ive been avoiding sex for 3 months now
29/06/17, 15:16 - Amin: I feel like I cant anymore
29/06/17, 15:16 - Janith: Now that's even more information I don't know what to do with
29/06/17, 15:17 - Amin: 😂😂
29/06/17, 15:17 - Amin: U R right, my bad ✋
29/06/17, 15:17 - Janith: Afraid I can't help you there dude. I got no experience in that department
29/06/17, 15:18 - Amin: So what happens if I fuck my proffessor?
29/06/17, 15:18 - Amin: I seriously like her
29/06/17, 15:18 - Janith: Though I was referring to the study from a purely scientific perspective. I can't figure out how the DNA gets there
29/06/17, 15:18 - Amin: She is alittle bit older than me
29/06/17, 15:18 - Amin: Like 10 years I guess
29/06/17, 15:18 - Amin: Will things go serious?
29/06/17, 15:18 - Janith: Depending on how it goes you might get bumped up or down in grades
29/06/17, 15:18 - Janith: Or nothing
29/06/17, 15:19 - Amin: Can I be expelled?
29/06/17, 15:19 - Janith: That depends on how the situation is approached
29/06/17, 15:19 - Janith: Yes... Or more likely she'll lose her job
29/06/17, 15:19 - Amin: Im a rich, handsome, smart boy, Im not used to approaching
29/06/17, 15:20 - Janith: Provided the information gets out
29/06/17, 15:20 - Amin: Yeah
29/06/17, 15:20 - Janith: You're used to being approached?
29/06/17, 15:20 - Amin: But I really like her
29/06/17, 15:20 - Amin: Yup
29/06/17, 15:21 - Janith: Do you want it to get serious?
29/06/17, 15:21 - Amin: Im something like a God in my country
29/06/17, 15:21 - Janith: If you say so
29/06/17, 15:21 - Amin: No, she is shaped.
29/06/17, 15:21 - Amin: Very shaped
29/06/17, 15:21 - Amin: And she has beautifull eyes
29/06/17, 15:21 - Amin: I like eyes
29/06/17, 15:22 - Janith: Then provided you two can keep it secret I don't see any reason to advise against
29/06/17, 15:22 - Amin: And she is the best in her job in my country
29/06/17, 15:23 - Janith: The eyes are the windows to the soul they say
29/06/17, 15:23 - Amin: I hope that things go good
29/06/17, 15:23 - Janith: What does she teach?
29/06/17, 15:23 - Amin: They mostly help me cum, but the thing you said was nice
29/06/17, 15:23 - Janith: Plan. It's a risk. Minimize exposure
29/06/17, 15:23 - Janith: Again. Unnecessary information
29/06/17, 15:23 - Amin: Finance
29/06/17, 15:24 - Janith: Interesting. Finance is an interesting field. I should look into it sometime
29/06/17, 15:25 - Amin: Its all about cheating
29/06/17, 15:25 - Amin: You have info that others dont
29/06/17, 15:25 - Janith: As for approaching, I'm afraid I can't help you there. Approaching people has always been more of a flow for me. Never bothered to check into it
29/06/17, 15:25 - Amin: So you bet on right stock
29/06/17, 15:25 - Amin: And you win
29/06/17, 15:25 - Amin: Simple as that
29/06/17, 15:26 - Janith: Ah... Maybe I was thinking economics :/
29/06/17, 15:26 - Amin: Same for me
29/06/17, 15:26 - Janith: So then you won't have any problems.
29/06/17, 15:26 - Amin: No
29/06/17, 15:27 - Amin: I have issues in approaching
29/06/17, 15:27 - Janith: I can't really help much to make a decision because there's an emotional component involved and emotions have subjective value
29/06/17, 15:27 - Amin: I dont read long texts completely
29/06/17, 15:27 - Amin: 😂😂
29/06/17, 15:27 - Janith: That's your issue?
29/06/17, 15:28 - Amin: Ive choked my emotions and buried them in a depth of my balls
29/06/17, 15:28 - Amin: So no problem with that
29/06/17, 15:28 - Janith: Sex is emotional
29/06/17, 15:28 - Amin: For you
29/06/17, 15:28 - Amin: Yes
29/06/17, 15:29 - Janith: It's value to a person depends on the person
29/06/17, 15:29 - Amin: For me, I just cum and go to sleep
29/06/17, 15:29 - Amin: Sex is emotional for first 5 girls
29/06/17, 15:29 - Janith: I'm practically asexual

29/06/17, 15:49 - Janith: And honestly I'm not that big on meeting people either
29/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: they where not phyiscists or scientists.. but where amazing people
29/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: who changed me or added me some knowledge
29/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: me neither
29/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: but as i said
29/06/17, 15:49 - FABIO: sometimes i wanted to
29/06/17, 15:50 - FABIO: me and my flatmates would dismiss girls all the time.. to stay playing videogames
29/06/17, 15:50 - FABIO: or some shit....
29/06/17, 15:50 - Janith: That's the difference. I don't really want to
29/06/17, 15:50 - Janith: I'd just not have girls around who can't handle a game in the first place
29/06/17, 15:50 - Janith: Saves time
29/06/17, 15:51 - FABIO: hahaha
29/06/17, 15:51 - Amin: Dude, you share things most people dont understand, I know about your intentions for being good, but they wont get it
29/06/17, 15:51 - FABIO: all excuses... ok :/
29/06/17, 15:51 - FABIO: i said all this things
29/06/17, 15:51 - FABIO: to myself either
29/06/17, 15:51 - FABIO: or i have changed way more than i think.. or you will probably go the same path
29/06/17, 15:52 - Janith: If I do I won't last too long
29/06/17, 15:52 - Amin: Dude, you know the truth, but you dont need to share it
29/06/17, 15:52 - Janith: I've made a promise to myself to put a bullet in my head if I diverge too much
29/06/17, 15:52 - Amin: You got it wrong
29/06/17, 15:52 - FABIO: :/
29/06/17, 15:52 - FABIO: life is all about changing

Put simply, I don't want to change cause I'm quite satisfied with the way I am
29/06/17, 15:54 - FABIO: they call safe
29/06/17, 15:54 - Amin: If others change as much as you do, they wont improve, they go crazy, for that matter they seek stability, ok?!
29/06/17, 15:55 - Janith: My curiousity is purely academic.
29/06/17, 15:55 - Amin: So dont tell this stuff to every one, it wont help em
29/06/17, 15:55 - FABIO: my curiosity is for LIFE
29/06/17, 15:55 - FABIO: all of it

29/06/17, 15:59 - FABIO: so... i think this is why i say all this
29/06/17, 15:59 - Janith: Now then. Any of you two know some more philosophical anime?

29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: i cant remmember the name
29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: hahahaha
29/06/17, 16:00 - Janith: @554691068741 I'm uninterested in it but there are people who are struggling with it and could use the help
29/06/17, 16:00 - Amin: Go on
29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: https://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori
29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: THIS ONE
29/06/17, 16:00 - Janith: You'll be a godsend for them
29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: hmm... interesting.. :3
29/06/17, 16:00 - FABIO: =D
29/06/17, 16:01 - Juancho: Couldn't agree with you more
29/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: @94754191589 
https://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori
this one
29/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: its a master piece
29/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: as i see it
29/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: better than full metal alchemist
29/06/17, 16:01 - Janith: Thanks. I'll check it out as soon as I finish Evangelion
29/06/17, 16:01 - FABIO: and... we all know... that full metal alchemist IS THE BEST
29/06/17, 16:01 - Janith: Now that's what I'd like to hear!
29/06/17, 16:01 - Janith: Definitely was one of the best
29/06/17, 16:02 - FABIO: so you understand that when i say : that anime is good.. it is REALLY good
29/06/17, 16:02 - FABIO: nice
29/06/17, 16:02 - FABIO: =D
29/06/17, 16:02 - FABIO: its so strange.. that it doesnt even have an anime intro
29/06/17, 16:02 - FABIO: they dont have an astupid song.... at the beginin of every episode
29/06/17, 16:03 - FABIO: and the time of the anime.. its the entire life of a girl... so its something like 90 years.. in 24 episodes
29/06/17, 16:03 - FABIO: i found it.. awesome
29/06/17, 16:03 - Janith: Personally I prefer anime over live action and other forms of TV media. The medium is much more versatile
29/06/17, 16:03 - Janith: Well that sucks. Anime has some really catchy theme songs
29/06/17, 16:03 - FABIO: anime as i found it.. way more phylosophical
29/06/17, 16:04 - FABIO: all ways
29/06/17, 16:04 - Janith: I think that's cause we haven't looked at other mediums as much
29/06/17, 16:04 - FABIO: you dont find movies.. with the same plot as animes
29/06/17, 16:05 - Janith: I just like anime cause they're not limited to budgets for effects
29/06/17, 16:05 - FABIO: nor those big tities.. that some times is nice... like high shcool of the dead... awesome anime.. awesome tities
29/06/17, 16:05 - FABIO: hahahahahahah
29/06/17, 16:05 - Janith: Well if you made a movie with the grand nature of anime you'd probably bankrupt a studio
29/06/17, 16:06 - Janith: 😑 how old are you?
29/06/17, 16:06 - FABIO: hahaha

30/06/17, 10:39 - Arne: I found listening the easiest.
30/06/17, 10:39 - Amin: Is my weakest point
30/06/17, 10:39 - Arne: I can understand
30/06/17, 10:39 - Amin: Im good at listening and reading
30/06/17, 10:39 - Amin: And my speaking is awfull
30/06/17, 10:40 - Amin: I suck at writing too
30/06/17, 10:40 - Amin: Thats why Im sending voice messages
30/06/17, 10:40 - Amin: I dont know why, but I have indian accent
30/06/17, 10:41 - Arne: Ah, but if you said it wrong, the change that we will correct you is. Not huge. Most of those here aren't from an English speaking nation
30/06/17, 10:41 - Amin: I mostly work on my accent here
30/06/17, 10:41 - Amin: Not anything else
30/06/17, 10:42 - Arne: Then you should listen to some English people? And go talk english (what you already do)

30/06/17, 11:01 - Imeldaroswara: How to ace english speaking test...?

Use K-I-S-S method. Keep It Simple and Stupid. "It" as in your sentences.

Stick to the basic sentence format, subject-verb-object.

And focus on 3 basic tenses, present tense, past tense, and future tense.

Been tested TOEFL and IELTS more than once. 😬
30/06/17, 11:04 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
30/06/17, 11:04 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
30/06/17, 11:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I procrastinated so much during exams that I have nothing left to do now after finnishing them...
30/06/17, 11:13 - Imeldaroswara: Haha.. I am not that "cruel".

I wish time could be sold and bought. I would like to have more time.
30/06/17, 11:13 - Lulu: Sleep?
30/06/17, 11:13 - Lulu: Idk
30/06/17, 11:14 - Lulu: Lol I feel like if teachers here said that as a technique though they would say keep it simple stupid
30/06/17, 11:14 - Janith: The idea depends on what you're referring to when you're talking about time
30/06/17, 11:15 - Janith: If you mean you want more time to live then in a scenario where there was a government regulated maximum age then time could be bought and sold
30/06/17, 11:15 - Janith: If it was allowed
30/06/17, 11:16 - Janith: But of course if you're referring to time as in the temporal dimension then there's no way of doing that without using console commands for reality
30/06/17, 11:17 - Imeldaroswara: No.. I am talking time as in so I have more hours in a day to finish every tasks I have.
30/06/17, 11:17 - Janith: Yeah... In that case you're gonna need cheat codes
30/06/17, 11:18 - Imeldaroswara: Sometimes I am thinking, since mind is powerful. Why don't I create my own watch, with 60 hours instead of 24 hours. That way I will be in illusion that I have enough time to complete my tasks.
30/06/17, 11:18 - Imeldaroswara: Haha...
30/06/17, 11:19 - Janith: Or you could just put yourself in suspended animation for a couple of billion years
30/06/17, 11:19 - Imeldaroswara: Then who will do my programming tasks...?
30/06/17, 11:19 - Janith: Since the earth's rotation is gradually slowing odds are you might be able to get at least some more minutes when you come back out
30/06/17, 11:20 - Janith: Well... The idea doesn't work for the present 😅
30/06/17, 11:20 - Janith: WAIT
30/06/17, 11:20 - Janith: Go near a black hole!
30/06/17, 11:20 - Janith: Like in interstellar
30/06/17, 11:21 - FABIO: Do you
30/06/17, 11:21 - FABIO: Program java?
30/06/17, 11:21 - FABIO: Please say yes
30/06/17, 11:21 - Imeldaroswara: Won't that be funny if the 6billion people....have their own allocated time in a day....? Like.. I would like to have 60 hours per day please. And somebody else will be like just 10 hours per day for me.
30/06/17, 11:21 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah Java
30/06/17, 11:21 - Imeldaroswara: Why?
30/06/17, 11:21 - Imeldaroswara: Although not exactly scripting style...
30/06/17, 11:22 - Imeldaroswara: More like if I need loop, there is an icon loop for that.. GUI programming.
30/06/17, 11:23 - Janith: Umm... Unless you're willing to make localized space time bubbles or something along those veins I don't see that being possible
30/06/17, 11:23 - Janith: What's the tool you use for that?
30/06/17, 11:24 - Imeldaroswara: It's just a matter of perception actually. But then, imagine the difficulties of arranging time to meet. LOL.
30/06/17, 11:24 - Imeldaroswara: Webmethods.. ever heard of it?
30/06/17, 11:24 - FABIO: I need to do a program for a college class
30/06/17, 11:24 - FABIO: And i just cant.. its java. I hate java
30/06/17, 11:24 - FABIO: But i need to pass that class
30/06/17, 11:25 - Imeldaroswara: What kind of program...?
30/06/17, 11:25 - Imeldaroswara: There is a saying, "you don't love it, because you don't know it."
30/06/17, 11:25 - FABIO: Its a little game.... i need to make it work with the keyboard imput
30/06/17, 11:25 - FABIO: But Just doesnt work
30/06/17, 11:25 - FABIO: Tryed everything i could found
30/06/17, 11:25 - Imeldaroswara: Can you pay my hourly rate...? 😁
30/06/17, 11:25 - Imeldaroswara: Just kidding....
30/06/17, 11:26 - FABIO: 😂😂
30/06/17, 11:26 - Imeldaroswara: Any error message, dear?
30/06/17, 11:26 - Janith: Well... If we could increase the processing speed of our brains then I guess it would be possible to get more time in a day
30/06/17, 11:26 - FABIO: Nope
30/06/17, 11:26 - FABIO: Just doesnt work
30/06/17, 11:26 - Imeldaroswara: I like error....they are challenging.
30/06/17, 11:27 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
30/06/17, 11:27 - Janith: Wait. So there's no error and it doesn't work?
30/06/17, 11:27 - FABIO: Yes
30/06/17, 11:27 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
30/06/17, 11:28 - Arne: If we get chips which can communicate with your brain, you can download "English speaking" to it, and you can get your info for English out of there. 
If you can get this real, you won't need so much school
30/06/17, 11:28 - Imeldaroswara: You really need to explain in "depth" what your definition of it doesn't work...
30/06/17, 11:29 - Janith: So I guess it's something wrong with the code that deals with the keyboard input.
30/06/17, 11:29 - FABIO: Yeah
30/06/17, 11:29 - Imeldaroswara: I keep thinking like that... Human brain should have feature like copy-paste... LOL
30/06/17, 11:29 - FABIO: My network
30/06/17, 11:29 - FABIO: Is shit
30/06/17, 11:29 - FABIO: Here
30/06/17, 11:29 - FABIO: So my web whats doesnt working
30/06/17, 11:30 - Janith: Unfortunately that isn't possible either 😅
Memories get encoded differently in different people
30/06/17, 11:33 - Imeldaroswara: Isn't memory just like neurons firing at each other? which is similar like low level electrical pulse. CMIIW....I am not brain scientist.
30/06/17, 11:34 - Arne: And the future we can make people smarter, just with the DNA. So then we need less time to finish school = more hours left to spend
30/06/17, 11:35 - Imeldaroswara: Yayy...more hours to read tumblr and pinterest and quora.
30/06/17, 11:37 - FABIO: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B621qFPLXNE-WlZDQ0lpdFJjMlE
30/06/17, 11:37 - FABIO: thats the code
30/06/17, 11:37 - Imeldaroswara: The thing about people is.... We have this bunch of minority who is workinh towards the betterments of human society. Meanwhile....the majority who cannot keep up...turns into bigots - radical people.

What a pathetic creature...
30/06/17, 11:38 - Imeldaroswara: Grant me access.
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: fuck... dont know how.. its my college drive
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: well
30/06/17, 11:39 - Imeldaroswara: Aiyya...just give screenshot lo...
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: its a little big...
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: 3 .java
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B83oas2ywboueTlBOTVaZ0JPRjQ
30/06/17, 11:39 - FABIO: now?
30/06/17, 11:40 - FABIO: just to say.. wasnt me who make that code.. my teatcher did
30/06/17, 11:40 - FABIO: i hate java.. so i cant do a better one
30/06/17, 11:40 - FABIO: what i need.. is to make the fucking car go up.. when i press up in the keyboard
30/06/17, 11:40 - FABIO: for some reason.. just do nothing
30/06/17, 11:41 - FABIO: doesnt read my keyboard
30/06/17, 11:41 - Imeldaroswara: Hmmm....
30/06/17, 11:41 - Imeldaroswara: Let me take a look
30/06/17, 11:44 - Janith: Yes but The pattern that forms a memory changes from individual to individual
30/06/17, 11:46 - Janith: I don't think this will happen anytime soon. Maybe not at all
30/06/17, 11:48 - Arne: I just think it's a matter of time.
30/06/17, 12:01 - Janith: Time isn't the biggest problem there. Ethical concerns would be the limiting factor in that kind of research
30/06/17, 12:02 - Arne: True
30/06/17, 12:08 - Imeldaroswara: @Fabio: what is the purpose of your program? I see there are some kind of tanks, blue, green, yellow, red..
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: yes
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: its a little game
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: i need to create a way to make new tanks...
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: and making then go foard
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: by using the keyboard
30/06/17, 12:09 - FABIO: but dont know why... just doesnt read
30/06/17, 12:10 - FABIO: my keyboard
30/06/17, 12:10 - Imeldaroswara: There are 4 tanks...how do you know which tank to move...using which key..
30/06/17, 12:11 - FABIO: by clicking in then
30/06/17, 12:11 - FABIO: with the mouse
30/06/17, 12:12 - Imeldaroswara: So, the sequence will be, my mouse click on the red tank, then i press space, then it will move forward a little bit?
30/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: yeah
30/06/17, 12:12 - FABIO: the mouse is working fine... but my problem was with the keyboard
30/06/17, 12:13 - FABIO: i use the mouse to hin to turn
30/06/17, 12:13 - FABIO: clock or counterclock
30/06/17, 12:14 - Imeldaroswara: Ah...ok, so cute
30/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: hahaha
30/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: i dont like the way java is
30/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: in c.. o dont even use the pow or sqrt functions
30/06/17, 12:14 - FABIO: i build my own
30/06/17, 12:18 - FABIO: so. i have to go now... going to college...
30/06/17, 12:19 - Imeldaroswara: Time is the matter here...
I wish it will come true before I die.... hehehe.
30/06/17, 12:44 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
30/06/17, 12:44 - Imeldaroswara: @Fabio
You just need to set the focus first before adding the keyboard event.
30/06/17, 12:45 - Imeldaroswara: Signing out now. Ciao.
30/06/17, 12:46 - Juancho: INTP in a picture
30/06/17, 13:05 - Janith: GUYS!! 
the article I shared here yesterday about women carrying the DNA of men they ha d sex with IS BULLSHIT. 
The author made some logical leaps in the article. The accompanying study has no such claim. 

Apologies for the misinformation
30/06/17, 13:27 - FABIO: Hmmm how i do it
30/06/17, 13:27 - FABIO: ?

01/07/17, 12:55 - Lulu: There has to be some solution
01/07/17, 12:57 - Lulu: Maybe a separate chat with amin and a few others who want to help him with language and is strictly voice messagr
01/07/17, 12:57 - Lulu: Message
01/07/17, 12:59 - Maureen: I mean talking alone doesn't help much, he'd need someone who tells him what to do better
01/07/17, 12:59 - Maureen: or different
01/07/17, 12:59 - Maureen: or else he could write - same thing
01/07/17, 12:59 - Lulu: But TBH if he want to improve language there are surely better ways than asking everyone to voice message, although it is one thing
01/07/17, 13:00 - Lulu: That's where a separate chat would help if anyone would wanna help
01/07/17, 13:10 - Amin: Ok seriously rather you 2 stop talkin about me

01/07/17, 13:15 - Lulu: We are trying to come up with a solution for it
01/07/17, 13:15 - Lulu: It's not like we are bashing you lol
01/07/17, 13:17 - Lulu: And to be honest I just kinda found it kind of rude how you came across to Maureen, it's true that her 5g isn't your problem but it doesn't mean you can't be considerate about her situation
01/07/17, 13:19 - Lulu: And I think most of us can agree it's great you are trying to practice language but there are better ways to do it and I'm pretty sure a lot of us would be willing to help with those alternate ways, speaking for myself at least and those I have seen replying to you
01/07/17, 13:21 - Amin: Is snow, wich is solid at first and then turns into liquid, amorphous water?!
01/07/17, 13:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't know. I just had a one-minute read through it. Haven't had the time to read properly. I'll get back to you on that
01/07/17, 13:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'd be inclined to say it's crystalline but I don't know
01/07/17, 13:26 - Amin: Ok
01/07/17, 13:30 - Amin: This article makes me feel inteligent, thanks
01/07/17, 13:31 - Maureen: I only have 1 GB on my phone - 5 GB on the PC but that's for my whole family...
01/07/17, 13:31 - Maureen: Thank you @14843534493
01/07/17, 13:33 - Amin: I havent read this one yet, but I always avoid eye contacts, Jash, Im starting to like what you read 😂👍
01/07/17, 13:34 - Amin: Oh no
01/07/17, 13:34 - Amin: Its about authism 😂😂😂
01/07/17, 13:34 - Lulu: If someone is staring at me I'll typically stare back
01/07/17, 13:34 - Lulu: This is a staring contest fam let's go
01/07/17, 13:34 - Lulu: ✌😌
01/07/17, 13:35 - Arne: Same
01/07/17, 13:35 - Lulu: Like ill give them a few glances to make sure and if they keep glaring I just smile and stare back
01/07/17, 13:36 - Lulu: I don't think I really mean to I'm just instinctively like "hi person!" When I make contact
01/07/17, 13:37 - Arne: If I stare to someone, and they look back, 
I immediately look at something different. This is only with people I ain't familiar with
01/07/17, 13:38 - Lulu: I'm that person who will flash a friendly smile to you on the street lol
01/07/17, 13:38 - Maureen: me too
01/07/17, 13:38 - Maureen: but I'm also the person who gets talked to on the supermarket by old people
01/07/17, 13:39 - Maureen: they tell me all about their life
01/07/17, 13:39 - Lulu: In the market I am often in and out but if I have time to browse I run into the friendly pedestrian now and then
01/07/17, 13:40 - Lulu: The first time I browsed alone though, I was overwhelmed there's too many things lol
01/07/17, 13:40 - Lulu: I know what I like and need now though
01/07/17, 13:44 - Lulu: I don't really like lettuce but in my head a salad with boiled eggs and peppers just sounded really good to me lol
01/07/17, 13:44 - Lulu: Maybe I'm just hungry? Hmm hmm
01/07/17, 13:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haha I'm contrary. I look people right in the eyes. People complain that it's intimidating 😂
01/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: U are intelligent body
01/07/17, 13:48 - Lulu: People often say that you shouldn't stare because it'll come off that way but hey people will think what they think lol
01/07/17, 13:49 - Amin: Dude, same here 😂😂😂
01/07/17, 13:49 - Lulu: Staring comes in many shapes and forms
01/07/17, 13:49 - Amin: Buddy*
01/07/17, 13:50 - Imeldaroswara: Me too...in the market or food court, old people always like to talk to me. One time, when I was having lunch in food court, an old man who ate beside my table saw me, pointed an article in his newspaper and talked to me in mandarin. When I know only 3 sentences in mandarin. Being friendly, I just smiled like a fool, not knowing what he said. 😬
01/07/17, 13:52 - Imeldaroswara: It was known that if you keep eye contact for 4 minutes, your heartbeat will start synchronized with each other. And you may fall in love.
cmiiw.
01/07/17, 13:52 - Maureen: I'm going to test that one 😂
01/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh hey
01/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Are you new?
01/07/17, 13:53 - Imeldaroswara: No... I've been known to exist since my birth date. 😝
01/07/17, 13:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆😆
01/07/17, 13:53 - Maureen: 😂
01/07/17, 13:54 - Imeldaroswara: Please be more precise...😜
01/07/17, 13:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Who cares
01/07/17, 13:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The point is that you understand what I'm trying to say
01/07/17, 13:55 - Imeldaroswara: 😬
01/07/17, 13:55 - Lulu: 😄😄😄
01/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Why are we called cynical?
01/07/17, 13:56 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
01/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: I also do wierd laughing too
01/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: 😂😂
01/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: When I dont understand what someone sais
01/07/17, 13:58 - Lulu: I'm guessing it's due to the fact we are less in tube with our f side. So we don't value small talk or regular how's the weather conversation mixed with introversion makes us look that way
01/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: I my self am cynical
01/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: So
01/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: 😂😂
01/07/17, 13:59 - Lulu: Since we are sometimes less interested in others we seem to be full of ourselves lil
01/07/17, 13:59 - Lulu: I think everyone's a bit of a cynic lol
01/07/17, 13:59 - Amin: Beside murder, Ive done every other sins
01/07/17, 13:59 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: It's simply realistic😂😂😂
01/07/17, 13:59 - Amin: I guess, Im not sure though
01/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: Name a sin
01/07/17, 14:00 - Lulu: Rape

01/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: I said Im sry after though
01/07/17, 14:00 - Maureen: gross
01/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: 😂😂
01/07/17, 14:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Fuck no man
01/07/17, 14:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Damn
01/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: Dude
01/07/17, 14:00 - Lulu: I rly hope that was just a sick joke
01/07/17, 14:00 - Lulu: Lol
01/07/17, 14:00 - Maureen: oh yeah, "I'm sorry for destroying your life"
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Only God can judge me
01/07/17, 14:01 - Lulu: Not true
01/07/17, 14:01 - Lulu: Far from true lol
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Rape is not that bad
01/07/17, 14:01 - Maureen: every God will judge you for that
01/07/17, 14:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Everyone who breathes can judge you
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: 😂😂
01/07/17, 14:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What the hell are you talking about
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Ok
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Dont get distracted
01/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Another sin
01/07/17, 14:01 - Lulu: ?
01/07/17, 14:01 - Imeldaroswara: Isn't it because we sometimes overanalyze everything? good side and bad side.
So, we are not wearing the rose-colored glasses like other people.
01/07/17, 14:02 - Lulu: Good point as well, we are not easily influenced by lenses
01/07/17, 14:02 - Amin: Ok see
01/07/17, 14:02 - Imeldaroswara: Doing lots of bad things are not something to be proud of, if I am being honest.
01/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: I cant get along with most of people
01/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: I never judge people
01/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: Some like rape
01/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: Some like to be raped
01/07/17, 14:03 - Lulu: In all seriousness of man that's honestly one of the lowest of things
01/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Man stop
01/07/17, 14:03 - Lulu: If you like to be raped you are consenting and if it's consensual it's not rape
01/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're embarrassing yourself trying to defend
01/07/17, 14:04 - Lulu: Difference between a kink and an illegal act of dominance
01/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Mmmm
01/07/17, 14:04 - Maureen: rough sex is not rape
01/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Ok
01/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Just gimme some thing to read
01/07/17, 14:05 - Lulu: Read this, rape is disgusting
01/07/17, 14:05 - Lulu: Oop
01/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: I actually hate all 4 of you
01/07/17, 14:05 - Maureen: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape
01/07/17, 14:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: https://www.rt.com/usa/393638-kkk-active-adl-report-us/
01/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: So as long as we can keep it pro
01/07/17, 14:05 - Lulu: I don't hate you but I find your actions repulsive
01/07/17, 14:05 - Maureen: I would tell you a story but then you'd say that this is the reason why I'm gay
01/07/17, 14:06 - Maureen: and there is no reason one could be gay
01/07/17, 14:06 - Maureen: because it's natural
01/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Let me correct that. There is no "sane" reason one could be gay
01/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: Kool kids klub 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
01/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: God
01/07/17, 14:07 - Imeldaroswara: I read this, and it's quite graphic-read...

https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra?utm_term=.ps306LWrw#.dtWZb4Ol2
01/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I read this article once. It was about how a rapist and his victim collaborated to author a book years after the crime
01/07/17, 14:08 - Maureen: I heard about that too
01/07/17, 14:08 - Lulu: Hm
01/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Ok
01/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It was on that entire incident
01/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: IMO, huge stunt
01/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Can we please get over that rape stuff?!
01/07/17, 14:08 - Maureen: no
01/07/17, 14:08 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah....the opening made me think like she's just a normal, "common" girl like me. 😖
01/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: Oh God
01/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: I lied
01/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: Ok?
01/07/17, 14:09 - Lulu: We aren't really directing it to you anymore
01/07/17, 14:09 - Maureen: my father made me rub his penis when I was about 1.5/2 years old. I can remember.
01/07/17, 14:09 - Lulu: We are talking about rape in general
01/07/17, 14:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah, Amin
01/07/17, 14:10 - Lulu: Also holding such a lie for a long period of time before retracting it still leaves suspicion
01/07/17, 14:10 - Maureen: he raped my sister.
I found him touching my breast when I was sleeping over in my parents bed.
he stared at my chest when I was growing up.
01/07/17, 14:10 - Maureen: my father...
01/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: Is it about rape?!
01/07/17, 14:10 - Lulu: I'm over it, you did it or you didn't just know its a horrible thing to joke abour
01/07/17, 14:10 - Lulu: I hope he isn't in your life anymore
01/07/17, 14:11 - Maureen: no contact
01/07/17, 14:11 - Imeldaroswara: @Maureen, I have normal childhood, but I am sorry for you. 

Gosh....why there is no hug emoticon....
01/07/17, 14:11 - Lulu: Good
01/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: Ok bye 👋
01/07/17, 14:11 - Lulu: 👫
01/07/17, 14:12 - Lulu: Hands are pretty close to a hug lol
01/07/17, 14:12 - Maureen: for a long time I thought what happened to me were bad dreams and coincidence. then my sister told me what happened to her. my while life fell apart
01/07/17, 14:13 - Lulu: I could only imagine such a sinking feeling 😞
01/07/17, 14:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've been trying to act like I didn't see this but well I think it'd be easier for you to not bring it up
01/07/17, 14:14 - Maureen: I never talk about it. nobody knows. and I'm also not able to talk...
01/07/17, 14:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah, we understand Maureen
01/07/17, 14:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You need not talk about t
01/07/17, 14:14 - Lulu: Idk, I find talking about things can help with coping
01/07/17, 14:14 - Lulu: The important part is not to dewll
01/07/17, 14:14 - Lulu: Dwell*
01/07/17, 14:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's difficult to talk about something over and over again wibhout obsessing over it
01/07/17, 14:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not everyone can. And even if they could, it's a pain not worth taking
01/07/17, 14:15 - Lulu: But not impossible, it's all about self conditioning I think although its agree it's not for everyone
01/07/17, 14:16 - Lulu: Although if it makes you uncomfortable it would be best to cut this train of conversation
01/07/17, 14:16 - Maureen: I act the way I act because of reasons. when I say something about language (@554691068741) then it's because women are treated bad in any way. by men in their lives. name me one woman who hasn't experienced sexual harassment
01/07/17, 14:17 - Imeldaroswara: I will use japanese emoticon style for hug

(づ◡﹏◡)づ
01/07/17, 14:17 - Lulu: Verbal and physical
01/07/17, 14:18 - Lulu: The other day at work this old guy said I should be a secretary
01/07/17, 14:18 - Lulu: In reference to my fairly prominent butt

01/07/17, 14:19 - Lulu: 😂😂😂👊
01/07/17, 14:19 - Imeldaroswara: Physical, never.
But verbal so many times. I think we have same issue, Lulu, fairly prominent backside. That's why I rarely wear jeans... LOL...
01/07/17, 14:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Did you troll him?
01/07/17, 14:19 - Amin: So did you know jarredd leto is bisexual?!!!!!
01/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: Such a bummer
01/07/17, 14:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He looks pretty gay to me
01/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: I love him
01/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: He is so hot
01/07/17, 14:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He ruined the joker's role
01/07/17, 14:20 - Lulu: Nah it was an old guy, it was a short exchange and I didn't think much of it until the receipt was taking its time to print
01/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: Ok, dont make it personal
01/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: He is very hot anyway
01/07/17, 14:21 - Lulu: I'm a cashier so most things are just flow of the motion smile, hello, have a food day
01/07/17, 14:21 - Lulu: Good*
01/07/17, 14:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm not making it personal. I'm making it factual
01/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: Actally for boys
01/07/17, 14:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I see
01/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: Jash, gimme some thing nice to read
01/07/17, 14:22 - Lulu: My mom worries of me wearing leggings or certain things because of my body but the thing is no matter what I wear I will always probably get a look or comment so I don't think its worth  being self conscious over or adjusting myself too
01/07/17, 14:23 - Lulu: Although see through leggings are no go lol
01/07/17, 14:23 - Imeldaroswara: I don't have leggings... Hahaha..
01/07/17, 14:24 - Maureen: show what you got and destroy men when they harras you

01/07/17, 14:24 - Lulu: LOL BASICALLY
01/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: Short jeans
01/07/17, 14:24 - Lulu: How I live
01/07/17, 14:24 - Maureen: don't teach girls to play low, teach boys to be polite
01/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Brb
01/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: Cool, send them in private
01/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: Instead of overthinking about sex
01/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: We can always think about more important stuff
01/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: Like e.g.
01/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: Toefl exam
01/07/17, 14:26 - Lulu: I lived my early years like 12-14 being kind of more self conscious of my body because of how displayed and over sexualized it was in the media
01/07/17, 14:26 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 14:26 - Imeldaroswara: Oh man... Teenage years... What a painful memory..
01/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: So you cant blieve how much progress I have experienced
01/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: My accent got a lot better
01/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: And I can talk fast
01/07/17, 14:27 - Imeldaroswara: TOEFL is easy.... Compare to IELTS...
01/07/17, 14:27 - Lulu: I got over it and learned to love My body more lol, I mean I've never hated it but I was conscious of it
01/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: God I tried so hard
01/07/17, 14:27 - Imeldaroswara: It focus more on grammar..
01/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: Dont be unfair
01/07/17, 14:27 - Lulu: More embracing it I guess
01/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: They both are hard exams
01/07/17, 14:28 - Lulu: I can't read the small lettering on that pic sadly but I have heard a few of those
01/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: Ok
01/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: About sex, I prefer to pay fot sex, if dont get mad
01/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: And some look for only sex
01/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: They dont like feelings
01/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: I like those type of girls
01/07/17, 14:29 - Imeldaroswara: @Lulu, sometimes, I was like "I don't care. Since I have it, why don't I flaunt it?"...
Let makes those men have bloody nose...LOL..

But that will be like 1 day every 3-4 months...

I mean Kim Kardashian flaunt it in photoshopped style....so why can't I..?
01/07/17, 14:30 - Imeldaroswara: I read somewhere, girl's brain is coded differently when it comes to sex...
01/07/17, 14:30 - Imeldaroswara: Sex for women is used for bonding....
01/07/17, 14:31 - Lulu: Lol like I know what I have no need to tell me 😂
01/07/17, 14:31 - Lulu: TBH never had it but I think it would serve dual purpose for me
01/07/17, 14:32 - Lulu: Although I don't think I could do someone that I didn't get good vibes about or have a good convo with
01/07/17, 14:32 - Lulu: TBH though I'd be just as pleased if I had a boyish body, I could wear much cooler things
01/07/17, 14:32 - Lulu: Lol
01/07/17, 14:33 - Imeldaroswara: The more a woman has sexual activities with more men, somehow the hormones for bonding will be produced less and less everytime.
01/07/17, 14:33 - Amin: Oh God
01/07/17, 14:33 - Imeldaroswara: Let me find the article.
01/07/17, 14:33 - Lulu: I still like my style but my body prevents me from certain styles

01/07/17, 14:33 - Lulu: What if you're just doing it alone 😂
01/07/17, 14:34 - Amin: My body prevents me from opening my legs 180 degrees

01/07/17, 14:38 - Maureen: a cashier wouldn't want to give me cigarettes today bc she thought I wasn't 18... so I showed her my id, which says I'm 24
01/07/17, 14:38 - Amin: Infp 's
01/07/17, 14:38 - Maureen: real id

01/07/17, 14:46 - Lulu: We talk about how rape is a horrible acr
01/07/17, 14:46 - Amin: Boys are so bad

01/07/17, 14:48 - Lulu: I mean if he considers himself one
01/07/17, 14:48 - Juancho: This is not just math, this is physics. I don't even know wtf i'm doing it anymore. With the level of knowledge and understanding on the topics and the maths I have rn I can skip at least 2-3 years in college.
01/07/17, 14:49 - Maureen: I'm not a virgjn

01/07/17, 14:52 - Maureen: if I'd be an admin I would have deleted @989306939802 from the group, because no forum for rapists
01/07/17, 14:53 - Amin: Yeah
01/07/17, 14:53 - Lulu: Why does the term virgin seem to be such an insult to you?
01/07/17, 14:53 - Juancho: See the thing is, my society is comprised by imbeciles. Sex and masturbation are frowned upon in my society. Girls are restrained from said activities. People think i'm unhinged because of my controversial views. Hysterically enough, I always win the debates (and by landslide I might add)
01/07/17, 14:53 - Lulu: Like "ha you haven't had sex you loser"
01/07/17, 14:54 - Amin: Dude, just do it
01/07/17, 14:54 - Imeldaroswara: Sex is a multibillion dollars industry nowadays. That's why it gets so hype.
01/07/17, 14:54 - Juancho: I'd have to literally rape them.
01/07/17, 14:55 - Amin: Seriously, lets stop talking about three things:
1.rape
2.sex
3.virginity

01/07/17, 14:55 - Maureen: it wasn't us
01/07/17, 14:55 - Maureen: it was you
01/07/17, 14:55 - Juancho: You guys started this nonsense
01/07/17, 14:55 - Amin: Ok

Or not? Idk, amin can you confirm/disagree?
01/07/17, 14:57 - Amin: They say that they can leave every body

01/07/17, 15:04 - Lulu: I don't care about it when you talk to me about it over and over and don't resolve shit
01/07/17, 15:04 - Lulu: When someone disagrees I get
01/07/17, 15:04 - Lulu: 😎
01/07/17, 15:04 - Lulu: Curious
01/07/17, 15:04 - Amin: Please stop talking and start reading
01/07/17, 15:04 - Amin: https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling
01/07/17, 15:05 - Amin: After reading this, tell me if you find yourselves either thinking or feeling
01/07/17, 15:05 - Imeldaroswara: My sister tells me about her problems all the time. 

One time she complained that she ordered books through sms to an online book store. In the website, it is said already, the format of sms. But she sent sms differently, that's why her order got processed in a very long time, like more than a month. When I knew the real story, I blamed her, for not following the instructions mentioned in the website. 

This was like 2 years ago.
It's in the moment of enlightenment that I realize....what she looked for is someone to listen and to understand. 

Hahaha... I feel so guilty.
01/07/17, 15:06 - Maureen: "People with the Thinking trait are often just as emotional as those with the Feeling trait – but they tend to subdue and override their feelings with their rational logic."
01/07/17, 15:06 - Amin: True, whats their motto?
01/07/17, 15:06 - Amin: I mean thinking guys motto
01/07/17, 15:07 - Lulu: I'm pretty in tune with both sides TBH but I'm more on the t
01/07/17, 15:07 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 15:07 - Amin: It is called "x" on mbti
01/07/17, 15:07 - Lulu: Much relate to this
01/07/17, 15:07 - Amin: Inxp
01/07/17, 15:08 - Maureen: T clearly
01/07/17, 15:08 - Amin: Cool,
01/07/17, 15:08 - Amin: So maurreen
01/07/17, 15:08 - Lulu: I know I just rather refer with t because that's what trait comes up with me more
01/07/17, 15:08 - Amin: Did you know in hard situations like yours, INTPs degrade into ESFP
01/07/17, 15:09 - Lulu: Like if I had a lot of money I'd try to develop something to help people rather than dumping my money somewhere and being like do whatever
01/07/17, 15:09 - Arne: I got that feeling too
01/07/17, 15:09 - Amin: Very thinker of you
01/07/17, 15:09 - Maureen: I never have an E, so not for me
01/07/17, 15:10 - Lulu: It's what I want to do with my life, become well established and help foster kids up in life
01/07/17, 15:10 - Lulu: Educatr
01/07/17, 15:10 - Lulu: Educate*
01/07/17, 15:10 - Imeldaroswara: I think the NT part of me is when I want to show my emotion to someone, I take a step back, and think, if the person is not even in my top-50 person-in-my-life-list, usually I will just ignore the feeling and say nothing.
01/07/17, 15:10 - Maureen: same. last week I was into a donation run - helped a lot in the organisation
01/07/17, 15:11 - Amin: No, you are not ESFP, ure a true intp, but take it like this, when every thing is dark, you dont see anything, u may act irrational, but when lights come back, u become your self again.
01/07/17, 15:11 - Amin: Thay sounds f
01/07/17, 15:11 - Maureen: I was born in the dark 😂
01/07/17, 15:11 - Lulu: I did degrade at a point where I flipped , I was just out of it and felt airy, my anxiety and depression made a cocktail that made me ungrounded and confused and I became very compulsive
01/07/17, 15:11 - Amin: Very T of you
01/07/17, 15:12 - Maureen: I also sleep over one night before deciding something
01/07/17, 15:12 - Amin: Actually yes, but if I was you I would have killed my father, and continue my life in jail
01/07/17, 15:12 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 15:13 - Maureen: let's not talk about what I wish for him to happen
01/07/17, 15:13 - Lulu: I would hit the fucked up the hear with a base ball bat
01/07/17, 15:13 - Lulu: Head*
01/07/17, 15:13 - Arne: Rt
01/07/17, 15:13 - Lulu: Both heads
01/07/17, 15:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😂😂
01/07/17, 15:14 - Amin: Its not about wishing, I dont find killing others a bad attitude
01/07/17, 15:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: smaller one first. Let the fucker feel it
01/07/17, 15:14 - Imeldaroswara: It takes me a while...but..LOL
01/07/17, 15:14 - Amin: So life is like simple
01/07/17, 15:14 - Amin: Do what you need to do
01/07/17, 15:14 - Maureen: he had prostate cancer a few years ago and from what he told me he's impotent...
01/07/17, 15:14 - Amin: Or regret why you didnt do it for your whole life
01/07/17, 15:15 - Maureen: that's what I call karma
01/07/17, 15:15 - Arne: All the things you do are just "things you do" and the human will stick an ethical number upon it, if it's wrong or righr
01/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: Fuck karma
01/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: I am karma
01/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: Well said
01/07/17, 15:15 - Maureen: you're so right
01/07/17, 15:15 - Imeldaroswara: What goes around comes around...
01/07/17, 15:15 - Lulu: Whenever I see someone abusing an animal online though all sympathy drains from my body and I imagine shooting them in the head
01/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: Just read alittle bit of phylosophy
01/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: And freud
01/07/17, 15:16 - Arne: They say in my country as a saying among youth: "karma is a bitch"
01/07/17, 15:16 - Lulu: Like straight in the head
01/07/17, 15:16 - Maureen: same here neighbour
01/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: 😅😅😅 karma never happens
01/07/17, 15:16 - Lulu: Yep
01/07/17, 15:16 - Lulu: Idk I see it a lot in my life
01/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: You see it is really reasonable
01/07/17, 15:16 - Lulu: I don't think it should be depended on
01/07/17, 15:16 - Imeldaroswara: Uhm..no...
Karma has "her" own time.
01/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: There are some stupid guys who are stupidly wild
01/07/17, 15:17 - Lulu: Justice should be served when due but the severity is different for all
01/07/17, 15:17 - Arne: Just today I saw a video on Instagram where some boys where hitting a fish they catch, with a baseball bat
01/07/17, 15:17 - Amin: So they get stuck because of their own deeds
01/07/17, 15:17 - Maureen: no, it just happens. nobody can say when and where but it will hurt
01/07/17, 15:18 - Arne: Buddhists believe in karma, I heard?
01/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: I seriously believe that we should doubt every thing we do in a simlpe way
01/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: Do we like it to happen to us
01/07/17, 15:18 - Imeldaroswara: Buddhist..yes
01/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: If the answer is no
01/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: So we can do it
01/07/17, 15:18 - Maureen: we should doubt everythjng
01/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: Simple as that
01/07/17, 15:19 - Arne: But we can doubt as much as we can. But it won't work. Like we don't know shit, where you wanna start with doubting?
01/07/17, 15:19 - Maureen: isn't it in Christianity that your actions will be handled at the final court?
01/07/17, 15:19 - Amin: Im sayin that, when we want to do s.th, there is one moral, would you like some one else do that to us?!
01/07/17, 15:19 - Imeldaroswara: Moslem too
01/07/17, 15:20 - Arne: I don't know at least what I hear now from the church is that they are preaching kindness for the world, so I don't think it's from Christianity
01/07/17, 15:20 - Maureen: in school I was raised to be critical. to not believe everything online, to ask oneself if the stuff you hear could be possible and start to create your own mind
01/07/17, 15:20 - Amin: Muslim,
01/07/17, 15:20 - Maureen: I love my teachers for that
01/07/17, 15:21 - Lulu: Lol I went to a shirty Catholic school grade 1-7
01/07/17, 15:21 - Lulu: Shitty*
01/07/17, 15:21 - Maureen: yeah but when you're dead and stand in front of whoever they decide whether heaven or he'll based on your life
01/07/17, 15:21 - Maureen: or actions in life
01/07/17, 15:22 - Arne: Https://intpforum.com/showtread.php?=14115

This is (if the link is right) something about sensitive intp,
01/07/17, 15:22 - Maureen: *hell
01/07/17, 15:22 - Lulu: I gotta go to work soon
01/07/17, 15:22 - Lulu: I also gotta eat tho
01/07/17, 15:22 - Lulu: And showerr
01/07/17, 15:22 - Arne: I don't hear that from the church the place where I life. Maybe some more extreme churches still preach that
01/07/17, 15:24 - Maureen: it's the bible

01/07/17, 15:24 - Arne: You are probably right
01/07/17, 15:25 - Imeldaroswara: Actually that's not the correct statements for Christian. The correct statements are:
If you believe in Jesus as your Lord and God and Savior, then you will go to where He is, which is heaven. If you don't believe, then you will definitely don't want to be with him, which is what people call as hell.
01/07/17, 15:26 - Imeldaroswara: The good things that christian do is merely the reflections of his/her faith to Jesus.
01/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: but when I don't believe in Jesus and don't act the way I think he would then it's the same as "my actions will bring me to hell"
01/07/17, 15:27 - Imeldaroswara: I am a Christian. 👆🏻😊
01/07/17, 15:28 - Imeldaroswara: No...your non-existence faith is..
01/07/17, 15:28 - Maureen: faith is ruling my actions
01/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: U are right
01/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: Oh my goodness...
01/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: Pedophile?
01/07/17, 15:29 - Imeldaroswara: Faith of what...? What is the foundation of your faith?
01/07/17, 15:29 - Maureen: very
01/07/17, 15:30 - Imeldaroswara: Oh... I see +65... Greetings from the red dot...🖐🏼
01/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: There is a hug gif,wait a min
01/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: well when my faith is strong I act the way Jesus wants me to, right?
01/07/17, 15:30 - Imeldaroswara: Yes..
01/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 15:30 - Imeldaroswara: Cute..
01/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: Older sister?
01/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: Yep
01/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: so when I am a Christian but I don't believe in Jesus I don't care about my actions and whatever I want
01/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: Yep Lulu
01/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: I like you haha
01/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: older half sister - not his child
I don't even want to know what he did to my younger sistwr
01/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: 😘😘😘
01/07/17, 15:32 - Imeldaroswara: Uhmmm... You are a Christian but you don't believe in Jesus... I can't comprehend that statement.
01/07/17, 15:32 - Imeldaroswara: Jesus is the corner stone of the Christian faith...
01/07/17, 15:32 - Didier: R u bi?I'm bi haha
01/07/17, 15:32 - Imeldaroswara: If there is no Jesus, there is no Christian.
01/07/17, 15:32 - Didier: 😉
01/07/17, 15:33 - Didier: Dun worry,there r always ppl out there who will love u
01/07/17, 15:33 - Arne: Hee didier
01/07/17, 15:33 - Maureen: I know but you can have a christianing and be raised in a Christian home but not believe in Jesus
01/07/17, 15:34 - Didier: What's this?
01/07/17, 15:34 - Maureen: believe me, I live in a Christian country without a confession
01/07/17, 15:34 - Lulu: Find nothing but faith in nothing
01/07/17, 15:35 - Imeldaroswara: If you don't believe in Jesus, then you're not a Christian. 
Your religion is Christian.
01/07/17, 15:36 - Didier: It's not a dichotomy so yeah
01/07/17, 15:36 - Imeldaroswara: I also used to think like that, my parents are Christian, I was raised as Christian. So I am a Christian. Years later then I understand the difference. 

Now, I understand why some people said true Christian is a relationship between you and God, it's not merely a religion.
01/07/17, 15:37 - Maureen: that's what my Catholic family says. that believe makes them stronger and more open
01/07/17, 15:39 - Didier: No different
01/07/17, 15:39 - Didier: Because I know ESFPs
01/07/17, 15:41 - Didier: Dude,it's not a dichotomy
01/07/17, 15:41 - Didier: It's just about what's dominant
01/07/17, 15:41 - Maureen: THANK YOU 🙏🏻
01/07/17, 15:41 - Imeldaroswara: Although some days, I really doubt my own faith, especially when I feel like very cynical about life, etc.

That is part of dark side of INTP...when INTP is in stress.
01/07/17, 15:44 - Didier: Yes that's what mbti means
01/07/17, 15:45 - Didier: There are actually many misconceptions
01/07/17, 15:45 - Didier: Thinking,just means u are more comfortable with following ur mind so u do that
01/07/17, 15:45 - Didier: Feeling just means u are more comfortable with following ur heart so u do that
01/07/17, 15:45 - Didier: Feeling does not mean u cannot be logical
01/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: Thinking does not mean u cannot be emotional
01/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: It just means those feeling types tend to be more irrational then thinking types
01/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: However,thinking types can be more irrational too
01/07/17, 15:46 - Lulu: Agree v much although I took that as common sense before
01/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: For example,one who cannot handle emotions
01/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: Common sense is subjective haha
01/07/17, 15:47 - Lulu: It truly is lol
01/07/17, 15:47 - Didier: What is common to u might not be common to others 😂
01/07/17, 15:47 - Maureen: exactly
01/07/17, 15:48 - Lulu: I just take it as, even if we are types we still are human
01/07/17, 15:48 - Lulu: We fluctuate and we are not set in stone a lot of the time
01/07/17, 15:50 - Didier: Wtf?
01/07/17, 15:51 - Didier: Yup
01/07/17, 15:51 - Didier: And I don't think things should just be labeled "right" or "wrong" all the time
01/07/17, 15:51 - Didier: It's more like what u should or should not do
01/07/17, 15:52 - Maureen: but then again: who tells you what to do and what not?
01/07/17, 15:52 - Maureen: in the school I work the kids bring me in a lot of grey area situations...
01/07/17, 15:52 - Didier: I'm critical because of my experiences haha.I used to be naive but,not anymore.
01/07/17, 15:53 - Didier: What do you mean?
01/07/17, 15:53 - Didier: Haha that's why it depends
01/07/17, 15:53 - Lulu: English work?
01/07/17, 15:53 - Didier: Watch Psycho-pass.It brings up that question
01/07/17, 15:54 - Lulu: So does zakyou no terror
01/07/17, 15:54 - Didier: When you learn it the hard way.It's painful,but u gotta accept it
01/07/17, 15:54 - Lulu: Might have spelled that a bit wrong but you'll get it
01/07/17, 15:54 - Maureen: they take a lot literal: when they run around and I tell them to sit down they sit on their chair and move around with the chair
01/07/17, 15:54 - Didier: I wanted to watch it but never.Should I?
01/07/17, 15:54 - Didier: Zankyou no Terror
01/07/17, 15:55 - Lulu: If you're into a fast paced speed anime probably would get bored but for me it was worth it
01/07/17, 15:55 - Maureen: or they sit down but the wrong way because I didn't define the sitting
01/07/17, 15:55 - Lulu: There are more analytical moments
01/07/17, 15:55 - Lulu: A few dull ones but in a good way
01/07/17, 15:55 - Didier: Okay,I think I will like it
01/07/17, 15:55 - Didier: 😂
01/07/17, 15:55 - Didier: How old r they?
01/07/17, 15:56 - Lulu: I was meaning to watch psycho pass too, do you recommend it?
01/07/17, 15:56 - Maureen: the kids I work with are between 11 and 13, but I also saw this in elementary school

01/07/17, 16:03 - Didier: It talks about mankind
01/07/17, 16:03 - Didier: What can you define "right" or "wrong"?
01/07/17, 16:04 - Didier: I think they know what u mean.They just don't what to do it
01/07/17, 16:04 - Didier: want*
01/07/17, 16:05 - Maureen: I know that they know. but I said what they should do and they interpreted it as something diferent
01/07/17, 16:05 - Maureen: they did what I said but it was still wrong

01/07/17, 16:14 - Maureen: so I can work on it
01/07/17, 16:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Dairy food is cheese. If cheese is bad, ftw
01/07/17, 16:15 - Lulu: This may not be v intellectual but I made some really nice rice
01/07/17, 16:15 - Maureen: most cheese is lactose free btw
01/07/17, 16:15 - Lulu: It had beans tofu cilantro and peppers
01/07/17, 16:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Bc cheese is pizza
01/07/17, 16:16 - Maureen: and melted cheese combined with salami or ham is cancerous
01/07/17, 16:16 - Lulu: Oh god salami
01/07/17, 16:16 - Lulu: Ew
01/07/17, 16:16 - Lulu: I use to like it when I was little
01/07/17, 16:16 - Lulu: But it's just so
01/07/17, 16:17 - Janith: I'm really sorry Maureen. I was skimming through all the messages and it seemed like you guys were talking about stuff like hairstyles but I actually just didn't notice the context
01/07/17, 16:17 - Janith: Also what's psycho pass?
01/07/17, 16:17 - Maureen: don't do that to my heart 😂
01/07/17, 16:17 - Lulu: Oh that was just amin trolling us and undermining our experiences
01/07/17, 16:17 - Didier: An anime
01/07/17, 16:17 - Lulu: It's an anime
01/07/17, 16:18 - Didier: Answering this question
01/07/17, 16:18 - Didier: It made me ponder about many things
01/07/17, 16:18 - Lulu: Ever watched hyouka
01/07/17, 16:19 - Lulu: It's more a school life anime but a good one
01/07/17, 16:19 - Janith: Ah yes..Amin
01/07/17, 16:19 - Didier: I wanted to
01/07/17, 16:19 - Lulu: DO IT
01/07/17, 16:19 - Lulu: Sorry. Been obsessed since I was 13 lol
01/07/17, 16:19 - Didier: Ok,hope I can do that at the end of this year
01/07/17, 16:20 - Lulu: All my friends I asked to watch it gave up because there are quite a bit more dull moments than what they'd usually watch
01/07/17, 16:20 - Didier: I would watch it because I found some quotes I like there
01/07/17, 16:21 - Lulu: Beautiful animation and music and great story
01/07/17, 16:21 - Lulu: And the character development seems like not much but it's noticeable in the little things
01/07/17, 16:22 - Lulu: They are all their own people even though on the surface they seem like tropes
01/07/17, 16:22 - Lulu: Let me guess the "if I don't have to do it I won't " one lol
01/07/17, 16:22 - Lulu: Not exactly that but close to that
01/07/17, 16:23 - Lulu: I rly wanna exercise before I shower for work but I'm so lazy
01/07/17, 16:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'd watch it but can't download 😒
01/07/17, 16:24 - Lulu: Just go to an anime site
01/07/17, 16:24 - Lulu: No download needed c:
01/07/17, 16:24 - Didier: All the good sites are gone now.Where should I watch them?No chance this year (major exam this year)
01/07/17, 16:25 - Lulu: Rip kissanime
01/07/17, 16:25 - Lulu: Cartooncrazy.net
01/07/17, 16:26 - Lulu: Wait NVm wow
01/07/17, 16:26 - Lulu: Just checked they only have two posted?
01/07/17, 16:26 - Lulu: Oh I didn't realize
01/07/17, 16:26 - Lulu: Cartoon crazy does anime dubs
01/07/17, 16:27 - Lulu: But not subs
01/07/17, 16:27 - Didier: How about anime subs?I don't watch dubs
01/07/17, 16:27 - Lulu: I wouldn't know I only watch cartoons on thwre
01/07/17, 16:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Streaming needs data too😬
01/07/17, 16:27 - Lulu: www3.kiss-anime.me
01/07/17, 16:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I only have a GB a day
01/07/17, 16:28 - Lulu: Ah
01/07/17, 16:28 - Janith: What about www.animetoon.org?
01/07/17, 16:28 - Lulu: NVm doesn't work either
01/07/17, 16:29 - Lulu: Oooh are you my new Savior janith
01/07/17, 16:29 - Janith: Haha I can tell you it works well. I downloaded the final 3 episodes of Evangelion just half an hour ago
01/07/17, 16:29 - Janith: A lot of ads though
01/07/17, 16:30 - Lulu: They
01/07/17, 16:30 - Lulu: Only have hyouka dubbed
01/07/17, 16:30 - Lulu: 😭
01/07/17, 16:30 - Janith: Oh yeah...They mostly have dubbed
01/07/17, 16:30 - Lulu: I've never heard a hyouka dub, it seems ongoing I wonder who picked it up
01/07/17, 16:30 - Janith: Sorry 😅
01/07/17, 16:31 - Lulu: It's fine
01/07/17, 16:31 - Lulu: The struggle lol
01/07/17, 16:31 - Janith: @14843534493 Have you watched Evangelion??
01/07/17, 16:31 - Lulu: Nope but I want to
01/07/17, 16:31 - Janith: The final episodes are so damn confusing
01/07/17, 16:31 - Lulu: It looks good
01/07/17, 16:31 - Didier: Do they have subs?
01/07/17, 16:31 - Janith: It's AMAZING!
01/07/17, 16:31 - Lulu: Nope
01/07/17, 16:32 - Lulu: I don't like this hyouka dub
01/07/17, 16:32 - Janith: The final episodes get really philosophical
01/07/17, 16:32 - Lulu: I mean
01/07/17, 16:32 - Lulu: It could be worth tbh
01/07/17, 16:32 - Lulu: Worse
01/07/17, 16:33 - Lulu: Okay they did hyoukas dub justice I think it's not too bad
01/07/17, 16:33 - Lulu: OMG what's happening why can I only find dubs
01/07/17, 16:34 - Lulu: I'd best shower for work now, see Ya in a bit I'll look for more anime sites later maybe
01/07/17, 17:01 - Maureen: I was just in the bathtub 😂
01/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081028205658.htm
01/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: Hatred stops logical parts of brain
01/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: And reduces our reasoning ability
01/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: The intresting part is
01/07/17, 17:35 - Arne: ❤
01/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: Love does the same
01/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: So hate and love are kind of the same, why one is so blamed and the other is so praised?!
01/07/17, 17:37 - Arne: They just the opposite. It's like everything has his equal. Like black - white
Good - bad. You even said that INTP - can turn into ESFP in some situation
01/07/17, 17:38 - Arne: But you are right
01/07/17, 17:38 - Arne: It's weird
01/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: Mmmm
01/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: So you mean all opposite matters, are kind of same things
01/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: ?
01/07/17, 17:39 - Arne: They are two outcomes.
01/07/17, 17:39 - Amin: It sounds kinda right
01/07/17, 17:39 - Arne: But idk
01/07/17, 17:39 - Amin: But kinda creepy
01/07/17, 17:40 - Amin: Arne, you know how much I hate female gender
01/07/17, 17:40 - Amin: So Im gonna stop it from know on
01/07/17, 17:40 - Arne: Stop with what?
01/07/17, 17:40 - Amin: Because sience says that it disables my reasoning
01/07/17, 17:40 - Arne: It does, indeed
01/07/17, 17:41 - Arne: It's called: generalizing. I saw you did it more than once. If you are aware of it, you can change it. So it's a good thing you say it
01/07/17, 17:41 - Amin: Im aware of it
01/07/17, 17:42 - Amin: Its just alittle bit hard
01/07/17, 17:42 - Arne: I can understand, if it's deep, it's hard to just let go
01/07/17, 17:42 - Amin: Yeah brain's way
01/07/17, 17:43 - Amin: When it learns to think in a specific way
01/07/17, 17:43 - Amin: It doesnt like to work in a new way
01/07/17, 17:44 - Janith: Something interesting I noticed. Love and hate both involve a large personal commitment toward an individual or a group
01/07/17, 17:44 - Janith: If the commitment is positive then it's love. Negative is hate
01/07/17, 17:45 - Janith: That's the only difference between the two
01/07/17, 17:45 - Amin: Isnt it scary?!
01/07/17, 17:45 - Amin: The way it works
01/07/17, 17:45 - Arne: It is.
01/07/17, 17:45 - Janith: It does explain why people who break up tend to despise each other
01/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: I don't have an umbrella I'm about to be ducked in a Minute
01/07/17, 17:46 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 17:46 - Amin: Exactly
01/07/17, 17:46 - Arne: rip
01/07/17, 17:46 - Janith: @14843534493 Facebook status goes on Facebook
01/07/17, 17:46 - Arne: Ying - Yang is a very old symbol. Also opposite stuff.
01/07/17, 17:46 - Amin: So you can be loved alot, and suddenly, you are hated alot
01/07/17, 17:47 - Amin: Oh
01/07/17, 17:47 - Amin: Again chocolate and cocoa
01/07/17, 17:47 - Amin: Read this
01/07/17, 17:47 - Amin: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170629101648.htm
01/07/17, 17:48 - Amin: Ok its official
01/07/17, 17:48 - Janith: Yeah... Though I guess feelings of betrayal play a part in it too
01/07/17, 17:48 - Amin: Belive me we can get improved by chocolate
01/07/17, 17:48 - Arne: What will happen if you suppress one of these opposites, would it affect your behavior completely?
01/07/17, 17:48 - Janith: Depends on how you consider the change
01/07/17, 17:49 - Janith: I personally haven't been able to really hate people I loved
01/07/17, 17:49 - Amin: Yeah, Im just taking a glance, my hatred for girls is a result of loving them so much, thats what actually makes me scare
01/07/17, 17:49 - Arne: Same.
01/07/17, 17:50 - Janith: There's a girl who I let break my heart two times and I still love her 😂
01/07/17, 17:50 - Maureen: love the people you love, hate the people you hate, but never hate the people you used to love
01/07/17, 17:51 - Janith: Someone you love betray you amin?
01/07/17, 17:51 - Amin: Oh, Same happened to me, I just hate her, and Lets just get over it, she was a CHEATER
01/07/17, 17:51 - Amin: I just answered that
01/07/17, 17:52 - Janith: First part I agree with. 
Second I don't. Hate is a waste of mental resources. 
Third also agree
01/07/17, 17:52 - Amin: Im too smart to cry for love
01/07/17, 17:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol no
01/07/17, 17:52 - Janith: But it's hard
01/07/17, 17:52 - Amin: 154
01/07/17, 17:52 - Amin: I know u wont believe
01/07/17, 17:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sometimes there's one side despising and the other letting them despise
01/07/17, 17:52 - Amin: But I actually am 154
01/07/17, 17:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And the indifferent one gets wasted and blurts all kinds of shit then
01/07/17, 17:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆
01/07/17, 17:53 - Maureen: I agree with that hate part. I mean why wasting time and spit for a person who is worth nothing to you?
01/07/17, 17:53 - Maureen: and emotions
01/07/17, 17:53 - Arne: Damn that sucjs
01/07/17, 17:53 - Janith: Sometimes yes. But as long as one side hates then my statement stands
01/07/17, 17:53 - Amin: Love is not like that
01/07/17, 17:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You talk like you understand love 😂
01/07/17, 17:54 - Maureen: what is 154?
01/07/17, 17:54 - Amin: We mostly create the one we love, the real person is actually different from the one we've created
01/07/17, 17:54 - Arne: IQ
01/07/17, 17:54 - Maureen: ah thank you
01/07/17, 17:54 - Amin: So the person I love actually doesn't exist, the person I hate does
01/07/17, 17:55 - Janith: Exactly. Hate will happen. But it's important to flush it out after the initial situation. Letting it boil serves no purpose and just wastes resources
01/07/17, 17:55 - Amin: And we all love our mommies
01/07/17, 17:55 - Maureen: no
01/07/17, 17:55 - Arne: Atm I don't hate anyone. It seems I can't hate people, it's weird. I can dislike them, but never hate
01/07/17, 17:55 - Janith: Love is strange. I did an interesting experiment with love a little while back
01/07/17, 17:56 - Amin: Can you guess why you hate all boys?!
01/07/17, 17:56 - Amin: The same reason I love infp 's
01/07/17, 17:56 - Amin: You hate your dad
01/07/17, 17:56 - Amin: I love my mom
01/07/17, 17:56 - Amin: Intrested
01/07/17, 17:57 - Janith: Hate is a big commitment. The general intp laziness ends up being helpful for us there
01/07/17, 17:57 - Arne: Great
01/07/17, 17:58 - Maureen: I don't care about my mother because she doesn't care about me. the only love I got as a kid was from my father and I don't know what the base of his love was.
my older sister who is 13 years older raised me
01/07/17, 17:58 - Amin: There is a reason, maybe it's because u never wanted something so bad, and there is another person who has it and wont give it to you
01/07/17, 17:58 - Janith: The experiment was, for nearly half an year I asked everyone I knew and plenty of new people I met the question "how would you define love?"
01/07/17, 17:58 - Maureen: to quote desperate housewives: "The opposite of love isn't hate. It's indifference. And if you hate me, that means you still care, and we're still connected and I still have a chance to set you right."
01/07/17, 17:58 - Janith: Nearly everyone I asked gave a different answer.
01/07/17, 17:59 - Arne: They did?
01/07/17, 17:59 - Maureen: have you asked kids as well?
01/07/17, 17:59 - Janith: The only two answers I got which were similar was of me and a girl. We both used the dictionary definition
01/07/17, 17:59 - Amin: Sure, because its not a tangible concept
01/07/17, 17:59 - Arne: Can be true.
01/07/17, 18:00 - Janith: Yes. Not really small kids though. Over 13
01/07/17, 18:00 - Amin: Love is a choice
01/07/17, 18:00 - Amin: I actually define it like that
01/07/17, 18:00 - Arne: Love is not a choice, in the first place.
01/07/17, 18:00 - Maureen: ask kids who are younger than 10
01/07/17, 18:01 - Maureen: you can't chose love, love choses you
01/07/17, 18:01 - Janith: The fact that it's desperate housewives means I'll never watch that but that quote is definitely gold. I completely agree
01/07/17, 18:01 - Amin: Love is a choice, and not loving is a choice to
01/07/17, 18:02 - Janith: I doubt that Maureen. Love is definitely a choice
01/07/17, 18:02 - Amin: Let me illuminate you by a psychology article
01/07/17, 18:02 - Maureen: name one thing you actively chose to love
01/07/17, 18:02 - Janith: Yourself
01/07/17, 18:02 - Maureen: why?
01/07/17, 18:02 - Arne: Love is a choice after you fell in love. If we talk about that. There is also different love like in; friends, family.
01/07/17, 18:03 - Janith: Why do I love myself?
01/07/17, 18:03 - Amin: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/getting-back-out-there/201504/10-things-you-need-know-about-real-love
01/07/17, 18:03 - Maureen: you chose to act after love. but love comes first. then the coice
01/07/17, 18:03 - Maureen: choice
01/07/17, 18:03 - Arne: It's good if you do, it will get you accept yourself.
01/07/17, 18:03 - Amin: And I recommend phsycholohy today to every one
01/07/17, 18:03 - Arne: Indeed
01/07/17, 18:03 - Amin: I also recomend webmd
01/07/17, 18:04 - Maureen: I can't read complex stuff in english. I could but it'd melt my brain 😂
01/07/17, 18:04 - Amin: Try alittle bit, you sound depressed to me
01/07/17, 18:04 - Janith: Attraction, lust, desire, social bonds. All that might come first. But not love
01/07/17, 18:04 - Maureen: true
01/07/17, 18:05 - Amin: God I have to wake up tommorow
01/07/17, 18:05 - Janith: Real love is a choice. Made consciously and with great thought. That's why it's beautiful
01/07/17, 18:05 - Amin: And study for toefl
01/07/17, 18:05 - Janith: (or at least perceived to be)
01/07/17, 18:05 - Amin: So, wish you guys the best
01/07/17, 18:05 - Arne: No that has another name
01/07/17, 18:06 - Janith: Which is?
01/07/17, 18:06 - Arne: Unconditional love
01/07/17, 18:06 - Amin: 👋👋
01/07/17, 18:06 - Janith: Good luck Amin
01/07/17, 18:06 - Amin: Arne, janith is right
01/07/17, 18:06 - Didier: Just because they have a similar point does not mean they are the same
01/07/17, 18:06 - Amin: Bbye👋👋
01/07/17, 18:06 - Arne: I think, when I get a girlfriend, and we would move in together, I would show this article to her
01/07/17, 18:06 - Maureen: unconditional love is not a choice. it's what a mother has for her kid
01/07/17, 18:06 - Janith: Err.. You just used an Adjective plus the word 😅
01/07/17, 18:07 - Arne: And the mother choice to
01/07/17, 18:07 - Maureen: no
01/07/17, 18:07 - Amin: Didier, lovely infp teenager, I need to sleep now, we'll talk later
01/07/17, 18:07 - Amin: 👋👋
01/07/17, 18:07 - Arne: I translated it. I didn't know the word at the beginning
01/07/17, 18:08 - Maureen: a mother doesn't chose to love her kid. without love she couldn't handle the pain of birth
01/07/17, 18:08 - Maureen: so without love no kid
01/07/17, 18:08 - Janith: That's not true actually.
01/07/17, 18:08 - Arne: But there are situations where woman are very bad behave against their baby's
 What about that?
01/07/17, 18:09 - Janith: An example I can give you is when my mom had to keep a mother in the hospital because she was trying to ditch her baby and leave
01/07/17, 18:09 - Maureen: psychological damage
01/07/17, 18:09 - Arne: With the damage, can you still say it's love for the child?
01/07/17, 18:10 - Maureen: what about mothers who lift cars because their kid is under?
01/07/17, 18:10 - Maureen: no, I say the damage is so big they can't feel the love
01/07/17, 18:10 - Arne: I mean the woman who 'don't love' the children they get, just because the baby exist.
01/07/17, 18:10 - Janith: Or the necessary bonds haven't formed
01/07/17, 18:11 - Maureen: or the kid was made out of hate (like rape )
01/07/17, 18:11 - Maureen: it usually does
01/07/17, 18:11 - Arne: So the woman will never love her child, if the damage stays.?
01/07/17, 18:11 - Maureen: the cases you say are not the usual case
01/07/17, 18:11 - Didier: They are not opposites actually.They just look like it.The opposite of love is not hatred, but indifference. An indifferent person would lack the drive to kill or hurt.
01/07/17, 18:11 - Maureen: that's up to the individual
01/07/17, 18:12 - Arne: Yes, but would this make from love a choice, or just feeling it, bc it's her child
01/07/17, 18:12 - Janith: I wouldn't say that 😅
01/07/17, 18:12 - Maureen: they start feeling this love
01/07/17, 18:12 - Janith: You make a good point Maureen
01/07/17, 18:12 - Maureen: just think about post natal depression
01/07/17, 18:13 - Maureen: that's mostly the case why mothers leave their babies behind
01/07/17, 18:13 - Maureen: because they can't feel the love
01/07/17, 18:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Those mothers have something really fucking wrong with them
01/07/17, 18:13 - Didier: Love and hate are similar,but they are different
01/07/17, 18:14 - Didier: Let me read the rest
01/07/17, 18:14 - Janith: Though you can't say that all love isn't a choice just because of that
01/07/17, 18:14 - Maureen: so why do you say that when you think love is a choice?
01/07/17, 18:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How does your own baby not make you strong
01/07/17, 18:14 - Maureen: they could "just chose to love their kid"
01/07/17, 18:14 - Arne: Last time my mom said it was at first hard to get a good relationship with my dad. He isn't a talker at all, etc. But one day she realized she could give "unconditional" love. Not just love him. But more than that
01/07/17, 18:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's like you brought a life into this world, so you got the responsibility to make it proud of you
01/07/17, 18:14 - Janith: Maybe. Maybe the necessary processes needed to form the parent child bond hasn't happened
01/07/17, 18:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's not a joke
01/07/17, 18:15 - Maureen: be proud of your parents, that's sooo rare
01/07/17, 18:16 - Janith: They can choose to love their kid. They just don't
01/07/17, 18:16 - Janith: Most mothers don't have to choose. Evolution takes that choice away
01/07/17, 18:16 - Arne: Oh I didn't know it was rare, at least, if the parents have self growth, healthy it can come, but you have to stay still at this, to realize you can.
01/07/17, 18:16 - Maureen: so in other words: I dare you to chose to love me
01/07/17, 18:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You mean morality
01/07/17, 18:17 - Janith: Who me? 😅
01/07/17, 18:17 - Maureen: but then it's no choice
01/07/17, 18:17 - Maureen: yes
01/07/17, 18:17 - Maureen: when love is a choice you can chose to love me
01/07/17, 18:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What a way
01/07/17, 18:18 - Arne: This is the reason why I first didn't get it, why it isn't a choice. Like once you love someone, you can get "deeper" into it, and for me it feels like that is a choice.
01/07/17, 18:18 - Janith: No no. Evolution. It's a valuable trait for a species to have the offspring protected
01/07/17, 18:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Why?
01/07/17, 18:18 - Maureen: to keep the species
01/07/17, 18:18 - Janith: I can but I need to get to know you first. Compatibility is important 😅
01/07/17, 18:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What's the instrument?
01/07/17, 18:19 - Maureen: then it's not a choice
01/07/17, 18:19 - Janith: Humans especially need the protection. Our young take forever to grow up
01/07/17, 18:19 - Didier: Sure,later
01/07/17, 18:19 - Arne: And looking in the eyes
01/07/17, 18:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How does nature make sure of it? By inflicting moral damage if one doesn't
01/07/17, 18:19 - Janith: No it is. I just refuse to make it without sufficient knowledge
01/07/17, 18:19 - Arne: Into*
01/07/17, 18:20 - Maureen: but you couldn't do it right away
01/07/17, 18:20 - Maureen: by not destroying our offspring
01/07/17, 18:20 - Janith: @4915127175996 I'm sure you're a nice girl and all but I prefer to get to know the people I commit to 😅😂
01/07/17, 18:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Don't be stupid. Are you and Janith even related?
01/07/17, 18:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There's a different bond between a parent and a kid
01/07/17, 18:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's a whole different connection
01/07/17, 18:21 - Janith: I'm saying I wouldn't. It's illogical.
01/07/17, 18:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Unless you gave him birth
01/07/17, 18:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I mean no offence by that "stupid"
01/07/17, 18:22 - Janith: @919426153395 I think you misunderstood something important
01/07/17, 18:22 - Maureen: I'm gay so I get this quite often: it's a choice. no it's not! I wouldn't chose to be less privileged than my straight pals or even put myself in danger. if I had the choice I would live an easy life as a straight person. but I can't. I just can't spend my life with a man!
01/07/17, 18:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What?
01/07/17, 18:22 - Arne: But the step from loving to - "unconditional" love, hou abou da?
01/07/17, 18:23 - Janith: Because I'm not sure what my relationship with Maureen has to do with anything here
01/07/17, 18:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: SHe asked you to love her
01/07/17, 18:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: To demonstrate that it's a choice
01/07/17, 18:23 - Maureen: 👏🏻
01/07/17, 18:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's pretty clear
01/07/17, 18:23 - Amin: Lack of oxycitocin, I cant sleep
01/07/17, 18:24 - Janith: Ah. Here's where our definitions clash
01/07/17, 18:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The love that comes between that intimate relationship doesn't between you and her
01/07/17, 18:24 - Didier: Not all parents will love their child though
01/07/17, 18:24 - Arne: I feel like I missed something, is it a choice? Or where my little arguments so bad that I didn't see Maureen said that it is a choice
01/07/17, 18:24 - Didier: And I don't think love is a choice
01/07/17, 18:24 - Didier: We are just made like this biologically
01/07/17, 18:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Janith says he thinks love is a choice I think
01/07/17, 18:24 - Janith: I use the dictionary meaning of love. Basically that love is caring for someone a lot
01/07/17, 18:24 - Arne: Pls anyone react?
01/07/17, 18:24 - Didier: Our brain "chooses" u can say
01/07/17, 18:25 - Maureen: Maureen still says it's not a choice
01/07/17, 18:25 - Arne: Thanks for making it clear
01/07/17, 18:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think I agree with you
01/07/17, 18:25 - Didier: Yeah not a choice
01/07/17, 18:25 - Amin: Not fair
01/07/17, 18:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Totally fair
01/07/17, 18:26 - Janith: Well... There technically isn't unconditional love between healthy individuals
01/07/17, 18:26 - Arne: So this love doesn't exist?
01/07/17, 18:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Only a fucking psychopath brings a life into the world to suffer through not having a mother/father who is still alive
01/07/17, 18:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @989306939802
01/07/17, 18:26 - Janith: @4915127175996 define love
01/07/17, 18:27 - Amin: 😂😂
01/07/17, 18:27 - Amin: 👍👍👌
01/07/17, 18:27 - Didier: Yeah,I always wished that I was straight so I can be like everyone else,but I'm bi.
01/07/17, 18:28 - Maureen: spontaneous without thinking: love is when you don't want to go to sleep cause reality is better than the dream
01/07/17, 18:29 - Amin: 👌👌👌
01/07/17, 18:29 - Janith: I see. Well the love you define cannot be a choice
01/07/17, 18:29 - Janith: Like I said. This is where our definitions change.
01/07/17, 18:29 - Janith: The way I consider love, it's a choice
01/07/17, 18:29 - Arne: I still don't get it about "unconditional love" 

In so much books, and stuff this term is used. Like even swans stay once they are together, spend their whole life together, and if one dies, there is a change the other one dies too because of a broken heart
01/07/17, 18:30 - Amin: Read about oxytocine
01/07/17, 18:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I know all about it
01/07/17, 18:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I studied neuroscience
01/07/17, 18:30 - Janith: I could love you. I don't because I see no reason to
01/07/17, 18:30 - Arne: And you say it can't be done?
01/07/17, 18:30 - Maureen: but I won't care for everyone so I put labels on people before - that's what I would call a choice. but not the love part
01/07/17, 18:30 - Didier: I think what u mean is caring about a person
01/07/17, 18:31 - Didier: Like u choose to care about this stranger
01/07/17, 18:31 - Janith: Swans and humans are different. Swans mate for life. Humans don't
01/07/17, 18:31 - Amin: You need therapy
01/07/17, 18:31 - Didier: But if u thought of this stranger as repulsive,I bet you wouldn't continue to love the stranger even if u had a choice
01/07/17, 18:31 - Maureen: 🖕🏻
01/07/17, 18:31 - Arne: Doesn't mean it won't exist. Because individuals can be animals. Got youu
01/07/17, 18:32 - Didier: So though you can make or not make a choice,you still cannot make a choice so
01/07/17, 18:32 - Didier: I don't know how to explain this but
01/07/17, 18:32 - Didier: In the end,it's not just black or white
01/07/17, 18:32 - Arne: It's grayy
01/07/17, 18:32 - Didier: You don't just choose or not choose to love something
01/07/17, 18:32 - Janith: In a way yes. But there are some differences. No point elaborating
01/07/17, 18:32 - Didier: It's ur brain that just makes it so
01/07/17, 18:33 - Didier: Why no point?
01/07/17, 18:33 - Amin: You define diffrent, paycho, not fair
01/07/17, 18:33 - Janith: Fuck it. I'll do it anyway
01/07/17, 18:33 - Amin: Me too
01/07/17, 18:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Wym
01/07/17, 18:34 - Didier: What I mean is that you choose to care for someone,but you don't choose to love them.Because love is the state that the mind is in,while caring is an action.
01/07/17, 18:34 - Arne: But something else. There are some tricks to let people fall in love more easier, by doing some moves etc. Is it than the Choice of the one making the moves to let the other person fall in love, so it's not the choice for the one who fall in love, but for the one making 'em fall in love
01/07/17, 18:34 - ‪+27 72 655 5407‬ saiu
01/07/17, 18:34 - Amin: 😑
01/07/17, 18:34 - Janith: For me "caring" is in the moment. If I care about someone I will listen to them and offer advice but unless they seek me out I will have no desire to check in on them. Whatever happens with them won't affect me
01/07/17, 18:35 - Amin: 👌👌
01/07/17, 18:35 - Janith: If I love someone I will mane an active effort to see to it that they're well. I will remember their condition and work towards helping them
01/07/17, 18:35 - Maureen: but that would require sympathy
01/07/17, 18:36 - Arne: This can't be done if the other person, trying to get the other fall in love, hadn't choice for it, ofc.
01/07/17, 18:36 - Janith: Not really. It just requires emulation
01/07/17, 18:36 - Didier: Yeah,u choose to do something,but u don't choose what happens
01/07/17, 18:37 - Maureen: would you listen to someone you don't feel sympathy for?
01/07/17, 18:37 - Arne: I would
01/07/17, 18:37 - Maureen: I wouldn't 😂
01/07/17, 18:37 - Arne: Because
01/07/17, 18:37 - Amin: Because you dont know yourself I guess
01/07/17, 18:37 - Janith: Yes. I have. If I have nothing important to do at the time and if I'm willing to interact with them
01/07/17, 18:38 - Maureen: I do 😂
01/07/17, 18:38 - Arne: There will be always some sympathy in me for that different person. And  if they did somethibg so so bad, I couldnt even imagine if I would or wouldn't listen.
01/07/17, 18:38 - Amin: No, laughing at it is a deffense mechanism called denial
01/07/17, 18:38 - Janith: Also if someone can be useful to me in the future
01/07/17, 18:39 - Arne: True
01/07/17, 18:39 - Amin: I listen to every one who talks
01/07/17, 18:39 - Didier: Let's be honest,it's both and it depends
01/07/17, 18:39 - Amin: I like listening, as long as its not stupid things they talk about
01/07/17, 18:40 - Maureen: because I won't waste time to get to know someone I don't feel sympathetic. why would I? what does it give to me?
sympathy is essential for me in a relationship, platonic and romantic. so no sympathy no relationship
01/07/17, 18:40 - Arne: So no sympathy requires to listen to someone.
01/07/17, 18:40 - Arne: So basically, you have put the wrong question here?
01/07/17, 18:40 - Arne: No sympathy no love?
01/07/17, 18:41 - Maureen: when I don't like someone (aka no sympathy) then everything they say is stupid to me
01/07/17, 18:41 - Maureen: a platonic relationship doesn't require love
01/07/17, 18:41 - Amin: Why are you talking to us? Why would we listen to you?
01/07/17, 18:41 - Janith: Well that's bothersome. If prevents logical reasoning
01/07/17, 18:42 - Amin: Subjective view never helps
01/07/17, 18:42 - Maureen: because you are some words written on my phone
01/07/17, 18:42 - Didier: Let's just move on to another topix
01/07/17, 18:42 - Amin: Why do you read em?
01/07/17, 18:42 - Janith: I fail to see what difference this makes
01/07/17, 18:43 - Amin: 😂😂🐔🐔🐔
01/07/17, 18:43 - Janith: Sorry didi. INTPs 😂
01/07/17, 18:43 - Arne: I gotta go guys
01/07/17, 18:43 - Arne: Have to sleeo
01/07/17, 18:43 - Didier: Why chicken
01/07/17, 18:43 - Maureen: because I got somehow into it and I have severe fms (fear of missing something)
01/07/17, 18:43 - Arne: I hope you all stay nice to each other.
01/07/17, 18:43 - Janith: CHICKKKEEEENNN!!
01/07/17, 18:43 - Amin: Because you are so little in my mind
01/07/17, 18:43 - Arne: Or at least, don't fight
01/07/17, 18:43 - Maureen: I go to sleep to
01/07/17, 18:43 - Arne: Don't make a mess (:
01/07/17, 18:44 - Maureen: bye ✌🏻

01/07/17, 19:36 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: https://youtu.be/21DJgRP5A5w

Do you think this is real?
01/07/17, 19:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No. No one can simply lie there that calmly while their legs are being sawed off
01/07/17, 19:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: She reacted only a little later
01/07/17, 19:39 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: There's two assistants
01/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: One in the box, and that other guy in the video
01/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Right?
01/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: No, did you see the girl coming out of the box at the end?
01/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: The legs were hers
01/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh yes
01/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I missed that completely
01/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: I want to think it is fake
01/07/17, 19:43 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: But a lot of people say that it's not
01/07/17, 19:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It probably is
01/07/17, 19:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm sure you'd scream louder than chainsaws if I tried to cut your leg off
01/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Wait
01/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: WAIT
01/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But the leg weren't hers

01/07/17, 23:50 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah...
01/07/17, 23:51 - Imeldaroswara: Real life issue of INTP...
How to cancel your agreement to come to your friend's open house, because you don't feel like it, without sounding rude... Hahaha... Sigh..
01/07/17, 23:52 - Didier: Open house?
01/07/17, 23:53 - Didier: Yeah I do that,because of that,I seem insincere to my friends...
01/07/17, 23:53 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah...he just bought a new house...and finished renovation and moving.
01/07/17, 23:53 - Imeldaroswara: Earlier this week, I felt like I would like to come...
01/07/17, 23:54 - Imeldaroswara: But today... Ooppsie... No. 😅
01/07/17, 23:54 - Didier: Just tell him u cannot go anymore?
01/07/17, 23:55 - Imeldaroswara: But...why...?
01/07/17, 23:55 - Imeldaroswara: I was struck by non-existent thunder lightning.... Hahaha..
01/07/17, 23:56 - Didier: Wait why don't u want to go?
01/07/17, 23:57 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
01/07/17, 23:57 - Imeldaroswara: I don't want direct human contact today.
01/07/17, 23:57 - Imeldaroswara: But virtual is OK.
01/07/17, 23:58 - Didier: Omg I'm hungry
01/07/17, 23:58 - Didier: Tell him that if he's ur friend?
01/07/17, 23:58 - Didier: Or go at a later time
01/07/17, 23:58 - Didier: U say that u want to go but ___
01/07/17, 23:59 - Didier: Just wondering but what is his mbti?
01/07/17, 23:59 - Imeldaroswara: My colleague...so not exactly friend level. Hahaha... Let's see lah...in 1 or 2 hours.
02/07/17, 00:00 - Imeldaroswara: Uhmm...not sure... He's not in the top 50 most important people in my life...
02/07/17, 00:01 - Didier: If he's an introvert,I think he'll understand

02/07/17, 01:14 - Imeldaroswara: https://writersforensicsblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/q-and-a-how-long-does-it-take-for-someone-to-die-from-carotid-artery-compression/

So for an assassin....if she can create a certain tool to insert block of ice into someone's carotid... She will have perfect tool for her job. 
Because later on the ice will melt. Although the victim's blood may still flow out of his severed carotid...but the amount of blood shouldn't cause a person to die of blood loss (I assume).
I wonder what the forensic will say. Hahaha...
Just a random thought.
02/07/17, 01:17 - Amin: Yeah😂😂 precisely
02/07/17, 01:23 - Amin: Is it possible to inject a block of ice into someone's neck? And how? It doesnt sound probable to me
02/07/17, 01:24 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 01:24 - FABIO: Till valhall
02/07/17, 01:24 - Imeldaroswara: Hence the perfect tool for murder.
I don't know what kind of tool is it.

But all I know is, "when there is a will, there is a way."

02/07/17, 01:28 - Imeldaroswara: Oh...I remember an article...where it was assumed that viking is all men.. when in reality some of them were women also.

I really wish someone will make a movie out of this living legend.
02/07/17, 01:45 - Amin: Do you like to be badass?
02/07/17, 01:46 - Amin: And why women like badass women and hate beautifull ones
02/07/17, 01:46 - Amin: ?
02/07/17, 01:52 - Janith: I usually just say that something really important came up and that I'd come on another day
02/07/17, 01:57 - Janith: I don't know why but I read this in my head in a very frozen kinda way. 
(do you want to build a snowman song. Except the lyrics were "do you like to be a badass")

02/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: A character for the next pirates of the carribean movie maybe? 😃
02/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: No wonder I feel like my Fe is ridiculously underdeveloped when I'm talking with NT women 😅
02/07/17, 02:04 - Amin: So actually the very feeling of guilt that tells us when we dump a girl,she is sad, its actaually that serious
02/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: Depends on the girl though. 
And I've never felt that 😅
My emotions just don't respond when I'm supposed to feel stuff like that
02/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Interesting discovery. Women initially feel a breakup much stronger than men
02/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: But in the long run the woman will recover completely while the man will still deal with certain feelings of loss
02/07/17, 02:07 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I'm actually an INXX tbh, but an more of an INTP
02/07/17, 02:09 - Janith: I think that's the case with a lot of people. It just depends on the effort you've put into developing your functions
02/07/17, 02:10 - Amin: Felt it once, ruined my life
02/07/17, 02:10 - Amin: I agree
02/07/17, 02:10 - Janith: Damn. Guess I should be glad I have a convenient defense mechanism
02/07/17, 02:11 - Amin: I have to, I dumped a lot, I think think "alot" part was my problem
02/07/17, 02:12 - Amin: 👍

02/07/17, 02:41 - Amin: Ok about the ants part
02/07/17, 02:41 - Amin: We should take ants serious
02/07/17, 02:41 - Amin: Human-ant ratio decrease by time passing
02/07/17, 02:42 - Amin: I believe we should start wiping ants
02/07/17, 02:44 - Janith: Bad idea. We need them more than they need us

02/07/17, 03:23 - Janith: Highly unlikely considering the intelligence gap
02/07/17, 03:40 - Amin: Yeah, I guess you are right
02/07/17, 06:00 - Janith: Guys. People should be allowed to end their lives if they wish to and society and the government should allow assisted suicide not just for people with terminal illnesses but for those who are satisfied with life and just want to end it
02/07/17, 06:00 - Janith: Agree or disagree? and why?
02/07/17, 06:01 - Janith: Personally I think they should. A person's life belongs to them. They should get control over it
02/07/17, 06:02 - Arne: I think they should first talk to some professionals, to really see there is no other way, and there is no other way to get back in life. My opinion would be: they can leave this world.
02/07/17, 06:05 - Janith: True. Considering the fact that some people might just be in a depressive phase it would be wise to allow them access to counselling so that they canmake an unbiased decision
02/07/17, 06:07 - Janith: And we should make sure that society as a whole can discuss suicide in an open and objective manner
02/07/17, 06:07 - Janith: Things like religious beliefs shouldn't come into play when making that decision
02/07/17, 06:10 - Amin: You have a point, but people change their minds all the time, and if it becomes a culture, I guess smarter people find life more boring in young ages than others, so there might be a progress problem in human life, also I don't like our numbers to decrease, It might be dangerous to our universal dominance.
02/07/17, 06:11 - Amin: Religious people can avoid suicide
02/07/17, 06:14 - Janith: I don't necassarily think that. I mean if we're talking about smart people then they probably don't care much for social norms anyway
02/07/17, 06:14 - Amin: There should be some rules which I'm gonna explain:
02/07/17, 06:14 - Janith: Religious people can avoid it but in the end their reasoning is hollow
02/07/17, 06:16 - Janith: Alright
02/07/17, 06:16 - Amin: No Im not
02/07/17, 06:16 - Amin: Ok so something came to my mind
02/07/17, 06:16 - Janith: Lol why not?
02/07/17, 06:16 - Amin: What if a mother of a new born wants to suicide?
02/07/17, 06:17 - Amin: What if a president wants to suicide?
02/07/17, 06:17 - Amin: What if our beloved ones want to sucide?
02/07/17, 06:17 - Amin: The last one is just for fun
02/07/17, 06:17 - Amin: 😂
02/07/17, 06:17 - Amin: Answer my first two questions
02/07/17, 06:20 - Janith: She should have aborted before she decided that. But if we're dealing with that situation then we have to assume that the mother no longer wants to be with the child. So under those circumstances I think the mother is unfit to raise a child if she doesn't love the child enough to want to raise it. So she can kill herself. The baby would have to be given up for adoption
02/07/17, 06:20 - Janith: Though I guess there should be a period where the mother would have to look after the child
02/07/17, 06:21 - Janith: After the child is old enough to be easily adopted then she can kill herself
02/07/17, 06:21 - Janith: Let him. Just move the next election
02/07/17, 06:21 - Amin: Seems reasonable
02/07/17, 06:21 - Amin: Ok are you kiddin me?!
02/07/17, 06:22 - Maureen: I think Amins points are selfish points. *I* don't want my partner to leave. Even if they are sick and _might_ get better
02/07/17, 06:22 - Janith: Totally seroius
02/07/17, 06:22 - Maureen: what about the father or grandparents?
02/07/17, 06:22 - Janith: I think the third point is the most important
02/07/17, 06:22 - Janith: And the one I agree with the most
02/07/17, 06:23 - Janith: If you really love someone then you should give them the right to take their lives if that is what they wish
02/07/17, 06:23 - Janith: Yes you can be sad about it and you should let them know
02/07/17, 06:23 - Maureen: exactly
02/07/17, 06:23 - Janith: But as someone who loves them you should respect their decisions
02/07/17, 06:23 - Amin: I think the type of suicide which is as a result of running from a responsibility is not accepted, specially important political responsibilities
02/07/17, 06:23 - Janith: I'm thinking early breastfeeding times
02/07/17, 06:24 - Janith: I generally assume that the people who wants to run from responsibilities like that are unfit to have them in the first place
02/07/17, 06:24 - Maureen: Some mothers can't breastfeed because they have no milk or not enough. there are good alternatives (as I mentioned before, Nestlé was born out of that)
02/07/17, 06:25 - Amin: Yeah, but they should finish what they started
02/07/17, 06:25 - Janith: Also I thought the president would just want to kill himself cause he's done with life. Not cause he wants to run
02/07/17, 06:25 - Amin: If any one kills himself when things get hard, its wierd
02/07/17, 06:26 - Janith: Well if she's unable to breastfeed then there's no objections on my end. She can kill herself whenever she feels like it. If she can though I recommend keeping her around. Breast milk is a little too unique to completely replicate
02/07/17, 06:26 - Amin: Its not important what he wants, he is afflicting a lot of people's life
02/07/17, 06:26 - Janith: It is. But they do. And I'd rather not have someone like that governing a country
02/07/17, 06:26 - Maureen: I don't think that's a reason for suicide. most people kill themself when they see no other way. they don't go that way because it's the easiest but because they think they have no other choice
02/07/17, 06:27 - Janith: The thing is, there's always another choice. They just refuse to see it
02/07/17, 06:27 - Amin: No other way?! There are a lot of other ways, always, A LOT
02/07/17, 06:27 - Maureen: but they don't see it!
02/07/17, 06:28 - Janith: I was suicidal myself so I know how that mindset works
02/07/17, 06:28 - Maureen: me too
02/07/17, 06:28 - Janith: I don't think it's that they don't see Maureen
02/07/17, 06:28 - Amin: They should get their shit together, and stop nagging, and start creating
02/07/17, 06:28 - Janith: If we look at things from a logical perspective it becomes visible
02/07/17, 06:28 - Janith: But we don't. So we stop ourselves from seeing it
02/07/17, 06:29 - Maureen: not everyone is a T
02/07/17, 06:29 - Maureen: depression is a black hole
02/07/17, 06:29 - Janith: Indeed but logic is one of the best ways out of that hole
02/07/17, 06:29 - Amin: Depression is a choice
02/07/17, 06:29 - Janith: NO
02/07/17, 06:29 - Maureen: I know that's why I live
02/07/17, 06:29 - Maureen: no
02/07/17, 06:29 - Amin: It is
02/07/17, 06:29 - Janith: Also no
02/07/17, 06:29 - Maureen: what else?
02/07/17, 06:30 - Amin: Actually every mental process is a choice
02/07/17, 06:30 - Janith: But that's because of phsyics 😅
02/07/17, 06:30 - Janith: Dude it's like saying feeling pain if your bone fractured is a choice
02/07/17, 06:30 - Maureen: I didn't mean the black hole. I meant a black hole
02/07/17, 06:30 - Amin: Oh
02/07/17, 06:30 - Amin: My bad
02/07/17, 06:31 - Amin: I mean dealing with depression is a choice
02/07/17, 06:31 - Janith: No I mean you can't escape a black hole but you can escape depression
02/07/17, 06:31 - Janith: Unless of course you count the event horizon as suicide due to depression
02/07/17, 06:31 - Janith: In which case it's a very good comparison
02/07/17, 06:31 - Maureen: metaphorically speaking you can climb out of a hole
02/07/17, 06:31 - Amin: I know a lot of people suffer from dep
02/07/17, 06:31 - Amin: But we must decide to overcome it
02/07/17, 06:31 - Janith: This is true
02/07/17, 06:32 - Maureen: dude, story of my life
02/07/17, 06:32 - Janith: Oh wait...not the gravitational singularity type? :P
02/07/17, 06:32 - Maureen: yeah
02/07/17, 06:32 - Amin: You should see a therapist pal, believe me, it helps
02/07/17, 06:33 - Janith: Whoops. Sorry Maureen. My bad 😅
02/07/17, 06:33 - Maureen: due to my overthinking and my T I can't get therapy. we broke it off when I was high on starving. I was dealing with my own shit for too long to accept help
02/07/17, 06:33 - Janith: Can confirm. My OCD was causing it. Went to see a psychiatrist. Got some meds. Now I'm back to my pre-depression self for most of the day
02/07/17, 06:34 - Amin: Also I said it for about a 1000 time, read freud
02/07/17, 06:34 - Maureen: therapy helped me with my anxiety tho
02/07/17, 06:34 - Janith: Dude I nearly walked into a tree the day after I read Frued 😂
02/07/17, 06:34 - Janith: Why overthinking?
02/07/17, 06:34 - Janith: It helped me with therapy actually
02/07/17, 06:35 - Janith: Only had to go for 2 sessions
02/07/17, 06:35 - Maureen: because I was basically therapeing myself
02/07/17, 06:35 - Maureen: which was - of course - contrary to my therapizt
02/07/17, 06:35 - Janith: Cause I'd figure out most of my problems and causes before I went. So that when I did see my psychiatrist I could get confirmation into suspicions and I had better info to give her
02/07/17, 06:36 - Amin: Dude, psychology is science, there have been people with your situation before, psychologists solved it and shared the results, step by step, they started to understand human brains issues like dep
02/07/17, 06:36 - Amin: 😂😂 you'll get used to it
02/07/17, 06:36 - Janith: Ah...that's a problem. Sometimes you gotta trust the psychologist Maureen
02/07/17, 06:36 - Amin: I walked into a lot of things in my life
02/07/17, 06:36 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/07/17, 06:36 - Janith: They do have more in depth knowlege in the field
02/07/17, 06:36 - Maureen: I know but I can't accept help
02/07/17, 06:37 - Amin: You can tell that to your therapist
02/07/17, 06:37 - Janith: It's that you won't accept it Maureen. Make the distinction
02/07/17, 06:37 - Maureen: so, I was about to go smoking when I had to text you guys
02/07/17, 06:37 - Amin: Its actually an intp thing
02/07/17, 06:38 - Maureen: I know 😂
02/07/17, 06:38 - Janith: I have that problem too. But I realized that I can never be fully myself if I don't fix my problem
02/07/17, 06:38 - Amin: Freud died because of jaw cancer
02/07/17, 06:38 - Amin: But he never stoped smoking
02/07/17, 06:38 - Maureen: for all I know I have med insurance until the end of August. don't have a job yet. so I won't start anything before I don't know about my near future
02/07/17, 06:39 - Amin: As you wish
02/07/17, 06:39 - Janith: From a logical point of view it made sense to swallow any and every emotion and argument I had because getting my suicidal tendancies sorted was vital
02/07/17, 06:39 - Janith: Do you know what's wrong with your mind ?
02/07/17, 06:40 - Maureen: I pulled myself out of my eating disorder - it worked until I moved back home
02/07/17, 06:40 - Janith: I actually found the one reason to say that smoking is okay 😂
02/07/17, 06:40 - Janith: Recently
02/07/17, 06:40 - Janith: What's the disorder?
02/07/17, 06:41 - Maureen: in that time I barely had anxiety or depression. I didn't cut myself - so I know how it works
02/07/17, 06:41 - Amin: Dude, we have duties for society. For ourselves, we should invent stuff, and influence the world, because we are almost the only ones
02/07/17, 06:41 - Maureen: anorexia and binge eating - that's why I was never skinny
02/07/17, 06:42 - Arne: https://youtu.be/UXp6dq5jg1g
02/07/17, 06:42 - Maureen: so I'm off - see you later
02/07/17, 06:42 - Janith: Unfortunately I can't agree with that. Duty is a lie. Just like the universe doesn't owe us anything we don't owe the universe anything either
02/07/17, 06:43 - Janith: That being said I still will be going into biology to do research and contribute but it's not because of duty anymore
02/07/17, 06:44 - Janith: I do it because that's what I want to do. I like experimenting and finding things. I like making discoveries and seeing their results and applications. So I will do it
02/07/17, 06:45 - Janith: So your anxiety and depression is rooted in your eating disorder?
02/07/17, 06:45 - Amin: I agree, we are born for this shit
02/07/17, 06:47 - Arne: Duty for your self?
02/07/17, 06:47 - Maureen: no but my mind changed. I think there is no root. it's all of them combined in some way.
but I thought "I don't have to be skinny to be happy" and I started to listen to my gut about food. when I felt like having fish I had fish. when I felt like pasta I had pasta etc...
I started to feel myself again and that helped a lot
02/07/17, 06:47 - Arne: To yourself?*
02/07/17, 06:48 - Janith: Yes actually. I only care that I do what I love and want to do and I must make sure that I do it well
02/07/17, 06:48 - Janith: So why did that change when you came home?
02/07/17, 06:49 - Janith: Because you were definitely going the right direction. why'd you stop?
02/07/17, 07:06 - Maureen: because I live under the same roof as my mother
02/07/17, 07:07 - Maureen: and she decides what to cook and my friends are back at their homes far away from me
02/07/17, 08:28 - Amin: Ok
02/07/17, 08:30 - Amin: I have an offer, start doing something daily, as a job, with no reason, just say this:
Life is bullshit, I dont understand it, because Its stupid, so lets live stupid life like stupid people, find a job, improve in your job, you are actually smarter than others, you can beat them in stupid things they think it is hard to get
02/07/17, 08:32 - Maureen: I have a job 😂
02/07/17, 08:33 - Maureen: but it's limited until the end of august. so I need to find something from September on
02/07/17, 08:33 - Maureen: and that's effing hard
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: Ok
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: Very good
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: So does it contain improving
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: Ok
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: Listen
02/07/17, 08:35 - Amin: I have a theory
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: And you know Im smarter than most
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Here it goes
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Stop being lesbian
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Stop sex
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Actually
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Both lesbian
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: And straight
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: No mate
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: Talk to Gof
02/07/17, 08:36 - Amin: God*
02/07/17, 08:37 - Amin: 10 minutes every night
02/07/17, 08:37 - Amin: Tell him whatever you want, just talk to him
02/07/17, 08:37 - Amin: Do it for 7 days
02/07/17, 08:37 - Amin: And tell me whats happens
02/07/17, 08:39 - Janith: Which God? 😂
02/07/17, 08:40 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 08:41 - Maureen: I don't believe in any god
02/07/17, 08:42 - Maureen: and I can't stop being a lesbian. and since I dint have sex at the moment that's a no brainer
02/07/17, 08:44 - Janith: But you do believe in the flying spaghetti monster right?
02/07/17, 08:44 - Maureen: no 🙈
02/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

HERASY!!!
02/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: *HERESY
02/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: 😂
02/07/17, 08:45 - Maureen: not a Christian so no problem
02/07/17, 08:46 - Maureen: never had a christening, never visited religion lessons in school, never had a connection to god
02/07/17, 08:47 - Maureen: (I live in a christian country, so most people I know are christians)
02/07/17, 08:47 - Janith: But you don't have to be a Christian to believe in his noodliness. All you have to do is believe ✨
02/07/17, 08:48 - Janith: Where are you from?
02/07/17, 08:49 - Maureen: germany
02/07/17, 08:49 - Janith: Agnostic/atheistic family?
02/07/17, 08:49 - Maureen: father Catholic, mother atheist
02/07/17, 08:49 - Maureen: but I don't believe
02/07/17, 08:49 - Janith: Oh right. Europe is generally less religious than the US
02/07/17, 08:50 - Maureen: no don't say that. it's just different
02/07/17, 08:50 - Janith: Alright alright fine 😂
02/07/17, 08:50 - Maureen: Spain and Italy are very catholic
02/07/17, 08:50 - Maureen: Germany has both catholic and protestants
02/07/17, 08:50 - Janith: Ah right. I guess generalizing to an entire continent is a dumb move 😅
02/07/17, 08:50 - Maureen: yes
02/07/17, 08:51 - Maureen: the US has every religion
02/07/17, 08:51 - Janith: Hey isn't turkey gonna join the EU anymore?
02/07/17, 08:51 - Maureen: they are not a religious country
02/07/17, 08:51 - Janith: I heard something along those lines some time back
02/07/17, 08:52 - Janith: The US isn't very religious? O_o
02/07/17, 08:52 - Maureen: I don't think Erdoğan can make those terms he needs to join
02/07/17, 08:52 - Janith: I mean yes it has a large group of agnostics and atheists but aren't there a lot of religious folk over there too?
02/07/17, 08:52 - Maureen: Trump is
02/07/17, 08:53 - Janith: Well I doubt the majority of his followers are non-religious
02/07/17, 08:53 - Janith: Political arguments are always fun 😂
02/07/17, 08:53 - Maureen: sooo the USA doesn't have religion lessons in school. kids go to church for that
02/07/17, 08:54 - Maureen: in Germany (in my federal state in the south) you HAVE to graduate in religion. or ethics when you're not christian
02/07/17, 08:54 - Maureen: there is only christian religion lessons
02/07/17, 08:55 - Maureen: Muslim kids aren't allowed there
02/07/17, 08:55 - Maureen: atheist kids are allowed in protestantic religion lessons
02/07/17, 08:55 - Maureen: not catholic
02/07/17, 08:55 - Maureen: religion is world wide, but how every state handles it is different
02/07/17, 08:56 - Janith: Whoa.. Personally I agree with the current US stance. Religion doesn't belong anywhere near schools
02/07/17, 08:56 - Janith: (or humans but that's a different matter)
02/07/17, 08:57 - Janith: And we have that system here too. I had to study Buddhism to graduate
02/07/17, 08:57 - Janith: Ended up with an A too 😂
02/07/17, 08:57 - Maureen: when there is a Christian holiday everyone has a day off
02/07/17, 08:57 - Janith: I can't see anyone complaining about that 😂
02/07/17, 08:58 - Maureen: we don't 😂
02/07/17, 08:58 - Amin: Just do it, I know, just do it
02/07/17, 08:58 - Maureen: Muslim kids get a day off on their holidays tho but they also have the Christian days
02/07/17, 08:58 - Maureen: no
02/07/17, 08:58 - Janith: The benefit of being in a country with a lot of religions is you get a bunch of holidays. At least we do over here
02/07/17, 08:59 - Amin: Have your own God
02/07/17, 08:59 - Maureen: oh and sunday is a dead day. nothing is open but some restaurants and cafes
02/07/17, 08:59 - Janith: Why would anyone do it?
02/07/17, 08:59 - Janith: Because of church?
02/07/17, 08:59 - Maureen: yes
02/07/17, 08:59 - Maureen: "on Sunday you shall rest"
02/07/17, 09:00 - Maureen: we're not allowed to be loud - by society tho
02/07/17, 09:00 - Amin: I have my reasons
02/07/17, 09:00 - Janith: @989306939802 what's your religious affiliation?
02/07/17, 09:00 - Amin: Islam
02/07/17, 09:00 - Maureen: but you were raised that way, right?
02/07/17, 09:00 - Janith: I think that should apply for nearly all days. I like the silence
02/07/17, 09:00 - Amin: Just do it
02/07/17, 09:01 - Janith: Do you guys have a special day of the week for religious stuff too?
02/07/17, 09:01 - Amin: Ok isnt it fun to have ur personal God?!
02/07/17, 09:01 - Amin: No
02/07/17, 09:01 - Janith: I noticed that a lot of belief systems use Sunday
02/07/17, 09:01 - Maureen: I'm an intp, that would work for like a week
02/07/17, 09:01 - Maureen: as long as I'm invested
02/07/17, 09:01 - Janith: What's fun about an imaginary friend?
02/07/17, 09:02 - Maureen: Islam is Friday and judaism is Saturday
02/07/17, 09:02 - Janith: Actually... An imaginary friend would be better
02/07/17, 09:02 - Amin: Ok make it like this, God is a kind father, which never hurts you, and loves you alot
02/07/17, 09:02 - Janith: I did not know that. Thank you for clearing that up Maureen 😊
02/07/17, 09:02 - Amin: Alot of things
02/07/17, 09:02 - Janith: No. He isn't. He created a world with pain
02/07/17, 09:03 - Janith: Then an imaginary friend is preferable to a God!
02/07/17, 09:03 - Amin: Dude are you mr.robot ing me?
02/07/17, 09:03 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/07/17, 09:03 - Maureen: I think it's scary to praise an imaginary person
02/07/17, 09:04 - Amin: Universe is scary
02/07/17, 09:04 - Maureen: I have imaginary friends since I was little. helps me a lot. but nothing about it makes me want to praise it
02/07/17, 09:04 - Janith: I want to disagree with you... But I use imaginary avatars too sometimes 😂
02/07/17, 09:04 - Janith: They're fun dudes
02/07/17, 09:04 - Maureen: yeah but you don't praise them
02/07/17, 09:04 - Amin: Ok talk to your imaginary friends more
02/07/17, 09:04 - Amin: Ask them for signa
02/07/17, 09:05 - Amin: Signs
02/07/17, 09:05 - Janith: True
02/07/17, 09:05 - Janith: Dude. No
02/07/17, 09:05 - Maureen: that would turn them into a God and that's what I don't want
02/07/17, 09:05 - Amin: Have patience
02/07/17, 09:05 - Maureen: just accept that not everyone's like you
02/07/17, 09:05 - Janith: Negative😂
02/07/17, 09:05 - Janith: There's no evidence for a God
02/07/17, 09:06 - Janith: There's no way a personal God can exist without being completely useless
02/07/17, 09:06 - Janith: There's no room in reality for a God to exist even (as described in religious scripture)
02/07/17, 09:07 - Amin: But what if they give you signs, what if they are real
02/07/17, 09:07 - Janith: Listen @989306939802 I get that it's tempting to go God with the unanswered questions and I admit I've toyed around with the idea of cosmic intelligences before but more often than not the simplest answer to something is the truth
02/07/17, 09:07 - Maureen: universe gives enough signs
02/07/17, 09:08 - Janith: And God is not an answer
02/07/17, 09:08 - Amin: Dude just wait
02/07/17, 09:08 - Janith: What signs??
02/07/17, 09:08 - Janith: Serious question.
02/07/17, 09:08 - Amin: Maureen would you like to try it or not?
02/07/17, 09:08 - Janith: I've been missing out on these signs 😅
02/07/17, 09:08 - Amin: Your call
02/07/17, 09:09 - Maureen: no
02/07/17, 09:09 - Amin: Cool
02/07/17, 09:09 - Amin: I blieve in choices
02/07/17, 09:09 - Amin: None
02/07/17, 09:10 - Maureen: we know that by now 😂
02/07/17, 09:11 - Amin: @94754191589 I cant reason God, cause its nothing reasonable
02/07/17, 09:12 - Amin: But I believe in God, stronger than every religious person, because of signs, I cant understand a little bit of islam, but I believe its a perfect religion
02/07/17, 09:12 - Amin: I know
02/07/17, 09:13 - Amin: It doesnt make sense to you
02/07/17, 09:13 - Amin: And its cool
02/07/17, 09:18 - Janith: I understand. I don't agree with the methods used but I understand they exist, why and how they're used
02/07/17, 09:18 - Amin: Exactly
02/07/17, 09:19 - Amin: Dude we may be simulation, u should know that
02/07/17, 09:19 - Janith: Honestly though as long as no one tries to pull an "Earth is flat" or "evolution is fake" I don't really care about the existence of religion
02/07/17, 09:20 - Janith: It only matters if it gets in the way of progress
02/07/17, 09:20 - Amin: No it wont
02/07/17, 09:20 - Amin: Actually progress is helping human to reach the point I blieve
02/07/17, 09:20 - Amin: That world is some ones pc
02/07/17, 09:21 - Amin: We are just learning about the softwares
02/07/17, 09:21 - Amin: And the way it works
02/07/17, 09:21 - Janith: Indeed we could. But that isn't a case for religion you know? 
If you're gonna take a logical stance then you'll have to state that there's an equal chance of every god ever mentioned being the creator
02/07/17, 09:21 - Maureen: science without religion is okay. religion without science is stupid
02/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: Ah yes. The often misunderstood quote by Einstein
02/07/17, 09:22 - Amin: Yeah
02/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: Who despised the very notion of a personal God
02/07/17, 09:22 - Amin: Thats why I believe we should believe in fake things
02/07/17, 09:23 - Janith: He preferred Spinoza's God. And I can see the allure of that too
02/07/17, 09:23 - Amin: Because its fake, its a little bit hard to explain
02/07/17, 09:23 - Maureen: I got it from Orphan Black - you guys should totally watch it!!!
02/07/17, 09:23 - Janith: What is it?
02/07/17, 09:23 - Maureen: a TV show about human cloning
02/07/17, 09:24 - Maureen: 24 episodes by now
02/07/17, 09:24 - Janith: Aaand it's added to the list 😂
02/07/17, 09:24 - Maureen: oh sorry, 44
02/07/17, 09:24 - Maureen: it's now in its 5th and last season
02/07/17, 09:24 - Maureen: in the beginning it's about science and religion
02/07/17, 09:25 - Amin: So I guess Im out, bye for now then 👋
02/07/17, 09:25 - Maureen: bye
02/07/17, 09:25 - Janith: I thought you were gonna explain this 😅
02/07/17, 09:25 - Janith: Mind PMing me the explanation when you can?
02/07/17, 09:26 - Janith: Are those the only topics they discuss?
02/07/17, 09:26 - Maureen: noooo
02/07/17, 09:26 - Janith: What else does it have?
02/07/17, 09:26 - Janith: Or does it approach a whole bunch?
02/07/17, 09:27 - Maureen: dude, it's complex
02/07/17, 09:27 - Janith: Awesome. I'll check it out
02/07/17, 09:27 - Janith: I gotta go now too.
02/07/17, 09:27 - Janith: Time for some alone time with the computer 😁
02/07/17, 09:27 - Maureen: there are 5 main clones: con artist, scientist, soccer mom, religious fanatic, and ceo
02/07/17, 09:28 - Maureen: but more than 20 clones in total
02/07/17, 09:28 - Janith: Do you know where I can watch it?
02/07/17, 09:28 - Maureen: (I lost count at 21)
02/07/17, 09:29 - Maureen: I watch it here: http://www.thedarewatch.com/orphan-black
02/07/17, 09:44 - Janith: Thanks 😁
02/07/17, 09:45 - Janith: @4915127175996 does the plot end somewhere in the middle?
02/07/17, 09:45 - Janith: It says it's on hiatus
02/07/17, 09:46 - Maureen: it's in the 5th season now
02/07/17, 09:46 - Maureen: no hiatus
02/07/17, 09:46 - Maureen: the plot there is shit but the streams are gold
02/07/17, 09:48 - Maureen: I mean what's on the page
02/07/17, 09:48 - Maureen: 😂
02/07/17, 09:48 - Janith: Alright. Thanks again
02/07/17, 09:49 - Maureen: the plot itself is awesome
02/07/17, 10:44 - Amin: Sure, Im a little bit tired right now
02/07/17, 11:55 - Didier: Can I join this discussion?
02/07/17, 11:55 - Didier: I agree
02/07/17, 11:56 - Janith: Of course. Do you have any specific ideas on it you'd like to put forward?
02/07/17, 11:57 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 11:57 - Didier: Though it's sad the person can't live with their life,it's their decision what to do with their own lives
02/07/17, 11:58 - Didier: If they feel that there is really no point in their lives and it is like that,I don't see a reason why to stop them as long as they thought about it
02/07/17, 11:58 - Didier: I think the most important is to give them some time first
02/07/17, 11:59 - Didier: Life is about living.Even if u kill urself,u still lived.Life is filled with a person's own decisions.We shouldn't take away that freedom.
02/07/17, 12:00 - Didier: A lot more to add but I'm hungry and eating now haha 😅
02/07/17, 12:00 - Janith: I don't quite get what this means when it says that everything worth wanting will be lost the moment it's obtained 😅
02/07/17, 12:01 - Janith: Haha no problem. Take your time
02/07/17, 12:01 - Didier: I think it refers to his personal experiences
02/07/17, 12:01 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 12:02 - Didier: Who knows what one thinks about death?
02/07/17, 12:03 - Janith: We really do obsess about the things we fear don't we
02/07/17, 12:03 - Janith: I never thought of it like that
02/07/17, 12:04 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 12:04 - Didier: Yep because it's always on our minds
02/07/17, 12:04 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 12:05 - Didier: How ought they live?No one can say.
02/07/17, 12:05 - Didier: Life is about living,whether sad or happy,whether it has ended or it's still continuing
02/07/17, 12:06 - Didier: All we have is the right to waver,fight for and search for the correct way to live our lifes
02/07/17, 12:07 - Imeldaroswara: "It is a given that everything that is worth wanting will be lost the moment I obtain it".
That is gold.

I remember I read something about an athlete who got gold medal in olympic. Instead of feeling happy, he felt misery instead. Because the goal/wanting is fulfilled now and that goal is his life's purpose. 
So, there is no point to his life anymore?
02/07/17, 12:07 - Didier: Not that there is no point,but he lost one of them
02/07/17, 12:08 - Didier: Because of that,they have to search for more
02/07/17, 12:08 - Didier: A reason to live
02/07/17, 12:08 - Lulu: I don't really agree with letting someone or helping them throw their life away if there is something that can be done to helo
02/07/17, 12:08 - Lulu: Help*
02/07/17, 12:09 - Didier: Yeah,what I mean is,we should help them first,but it's not up to us to decide or just force
02/07/17, 12:09 - Didier: Because while some people find no point in their lives anymore,some still wants to live,just that they feel helpless
02/07/17, 12:09 - Janith: Actually there was a study done about this. It showed how goal oriented thought might actually be bad for people
02/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: And that system oriented approaches can lead to higher levels of satisfaction
02/07/17, 12:10 - Lulu: People will do what they want anyways but I don't think assisted suicide for those who are suicidal is right
02/07/17, 12:10 - Didier: Ya haha that's one thing I notice from my sister.She is a judging type,full of goals unlike me
02/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: Because when people achieve those goals they feel empty and the achievement itself feels anti-climactic
02/07/17, 12:11 - Imeldaroswara: Frankly speaking, seeing my grandmother, she is still alive, probably she is around 90 years old by now. She experiences everything.
The loss of:
- husband
- son
- daughters (2)
- son in law
- daughter in law
- granddaughter
- grandson
- brother
- sister
- brother in law
- sister in law
😖
So I made peace with death.
02/07/17, 12:12 - Didier: I think that we should allow suicide but I don't think assisted suicide is fine though
02/07/17, 12:12 - Didier: Because first of all,suicide should be done by yourself
02/07/17, 12:12 - Didier: No one should go through the trauma of helping u with it
02/07/17, 12:13 - Didier: It is only allowed when they are able to accept it
02/07/17, 12:13 - Didier: Just like u see in shows
02/07/17, 12:13 - Arne: So jumping in front of a Train is good? Just let them swallow some pills and let them die...
02/07/17, 12:13 - Lulu: That's too easy
02/07/17, 12:13 - Didier: Made peace with death?
02/07/17, 12:14 - Didier: Not jumping in front of a train.There are other ways
02/07/17, 12:14 - Imeldaroswara: Won't that be great if we can create computer program to simulate how the world will look like after someone's suicide?

I am saying like...how people in their life will continue their life after effected by his/her suicide.
02/07/17, 12:14 - Lulu: I just think, if you actually really want to die taking pills is too easy, and it leaves time for them to reflect and change their minds
02/07/17, 12:14 - Didier: Because since from the very beginning of mankind,we already did that
02/07/17, 12:14 - Arne: If you don't help then realize there are other ways, they will still jump. And that's the reason why you should help them commit suicide
02/07/17, 12:15 - Didier: Yeah that's why I say assisted suicide should be allowed depending on
02/07/17, 12:15 - Didier: Whether the person helping will accept it
02/07/17, 12:15 - Arne: ?
02/07/17, 12:15 - Imeldaroswara: Too many variables to depend on
02/07/17, 12:15 - Didier: Assisted suicide haha
02/07/17, 12:15 - Didier: Just one actually
02/07/17, 12:16 - Arne: Exactly
02/07/17, 12:16 - Imeldaroswara: What?
02/07/17, 12:16 - Lulu: If they really want to they will realize there are other ways
02/07/17, 12:16 - Didier: If I see my friend sufferring,and only helping her with suicide will make her feel better,I will help her no mattet how painful
02/07/17, 12:16 - Arne: This one I mean with exactly
02/07/17, 12:16 - Didier: So this kind of situation is allowed
02/07/17, 12:16 - Lulu: I think it's selfish to ask someone to help you take your own life
02/07/17, 12:16 - Didier: What variables?
02/07/17, 12:16 - Imeldaroswara: Agreed
02/07/17, 12:16 - Didier: Yeah but
02/07/17, 12:17 - Lulu: We mean for suicidal people not medical
02/07/17, 12:17 - Lulu: I mean I'll try to help them until the end
02/07/17, 12:17 - Didier: U never know.That's why we should give them some time before they decide first
02/07/17, 12:18 - Arne: If they take the step they already thought about it for pretty long time. In almost all cases
02/07/17, 12:18 - Didier: Yeah I will too but you won't know what's the end and how u can help them
02/07/17, 12:18 - Didier: The best is when a person is rather self-aware
02/07/17, 12:18 - Didier: Some who wants suicide r self-aware while some aren't
02/07/17, 12:19 - Lulu: Just personally, if someone were decide to take their own life close to me and told me I'd to prevent it or help them in any way I could but when but comes to the act I want no part in it
02/07/17, 12:19 - Lulu: I'd try to*
02/07/17, 12:19 - Didier: It's also selfish to prolong someone's suffering
02/07/17, 12:19 - Didier: So it's best to have some time to explore
02/07/17, 12:20 - Imeldaroswara: I think... What people don't realize about death is that it's so final. There is no undo button for that.

Some people, mentally, are not equipped to accept that struggles are part of being alive.

It's a yin-yang situation. You know sadness, in order for you to know what happiness is.
02/07/17, 12:20 - Lulu: They can take their own life if they want, I don't think anyone is prolonging anything
02/07/17, 12:20 - Amin: It sounds lazy
02/07/17, 12:20 - Lulu: They prolong their own suffering
02/07/17, 12:20 - Arne: You don't have to take part. There are people "specialized" in this.
02/07/17, 12:20 - Imeldaroswara: Is it? Do they graduate from grim reaper university?
02/07/17, 12:20 - Didier: Yeah u r right.If u noticed,yin and yang is very prominent on this world
02/07/17, 12:21 - Didier: Ia me even doing an yin and yang piece for my major exam
02/07/17, 12:21 - Didier: I am*
02/07/17, 12:21 - Arne: At least, in the Netherlands, doctors can do it
02/07/17, 12:21 - Imeldaroswara: What exam?
02/07/17, 12:21 - Didier: Art haha
02/07/17, 12:21 - Lulu: I might just sound stubborn or cruel but I don't think
02/07/17, 12:21 - Amin: They can always search for reasons, isn't that basically because they have info lack?
02/07/17, 12:21 - Imeldaroswara: Oh...I was thinking how to put yin-yang in math formula.. LOL
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: Because people choose to turn back sometimes
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: And if you help them
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: And ots quick
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: They can't turn back
02/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: I will read the rest when I'm done with my dinner
02/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: Byee
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: There is no chance
02/07/17, 12:22 - Lulu: For recovery
02/07/17, 12:22 - Imeldaroswara: Preach it Sista!!
02/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: Might not be lack of info
02/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: That's why it depends,because it's not the same for everyone
02/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: 😂
02/07/17, 12:23 - Arne: That's the reason I said some hours ago, they should have a convorsation with a psychologist, to see if there is a way out.
02/07/17, 12:23 - Amin: Its more complicated than that
02/07/17, 12:23 - Imeldaroswara: Huh...Dinner at 11 PM
02/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: Yep
02/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: Of course
02/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: Yup haha
02/07/17, 12:24 - Didier: I eat late cuz haven't eaten
02/07/17, 12:24 - Amin: This is progress
02/07/17, 12:24 - Imeldaroswara: Ah..the doom of INTP.. need to eat, bath..😆
02/07/17, 12:24 - Lulu: Ur having dinner while I'm having breakfast lkl
02/07/17, 12:24 - Didier: 😆
02/07/17, 12:24 - Lulu: Lol*
02/07/17, 12:25 - Lulu: 11am
02/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: Will reply the rest when I'm back
02/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: It's the opposite here
02/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: 11pm
02/07/17, 12:25 - Imeldaroswara: Seriously...why people still not invent a pill that can give us 2 weeks energy...? Sigh...
02/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: While u can debate here first
02/07/17, 12:25 - Arne: That pill would be very unhealthy, I think.
02/07/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Probably
02/07/17, 12:26 - Didier: If it's a single pill,the person might stay awake and that will result in insomnia
02/07/17, 12:26 - Imeldaroswara: Why?
02/07/17, 12:26 - Arne: I go to a restaurant in about a few minutes
02/07/17, 12:26 - Imeldaroswara: No...even we burn calories while sleeping.
02/07/17, 12:26 - Didier: But yes it can result in insomnia haha
02/07/17, 12:26 - Didier: Not a healthy dosage
02/07/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Our body does lots of stuff while we sleep so staying up that long won't be healthy lol
02/07/17, 12:27 - Didier: In the far future I guess
02/07/17, 12:27 - Imeldaroswara: Imagine the spare time...we can save.. 1 hour per meal * 3 times a day * 7 days a week = 21 hours to spend on "important stuff"
02/07/17, 12:27 - Arne: All energy drinks, even coffee give you a fake energy boost. Because it doesn't give you energy, but helps you burn the stuff you already ate faster.
02/07/17, 12:28 - Amin: Ok, when you earn s.th you don't lose it, you own it, so you go for the next thing, and its pretty obvious
02/07/17, 12:29 - Amin: A regular use of coffee boosts your focus
02/07/17, 12:29 - Didier: Yeah
02/07/17, 12:29 - Didier: But sadly the pill worth of 2 weeks energy cannot be used at different intervals,the body will use it all at once
02/07/17, 12:30 - Lulu: Maybe a daily pill
02/07/17, 12:30 - Didier: And that's why u eat the same medicine at different times.If u eat that,u will be high on drugs
02/07/17, 12:30 - Lulu: Coffee makes me hype for a short burst of time then I feel horrible
02/07/17, 12:30 - Didier: It helps as temporary relief though haha
02/07/17, 12:31 - Amin: Intp s has the most drug tendency
02/07/17, 12:31 - Didier: Oh really 😂
02/07/17, 12:31 - Didier: Why is that so
02/07/17, 12:31 - Amin: Yeah, I sent a youtube video
02/07/17, 12:31 - Amin: Go watch it
02/07/17, 12:31 - Lulu: Escapism
02/07/17, 12:32 - Amin: I dont recall the reason
02/07/17, 12:32 - Lulu: P sure it was part of the dark side of intp
02/07/17, 12:32 - Amin: 👆👆👆
02/07/17, 12:32 - Lulu: Self destructive tendencies
02/07/17, 12:32 - Didier: If we can overcome this,we can eat a pill worth 2 weeks on energy just once without worrying that our body is hyperactive.So as long as we make the body use the energy at different intervals
02/07/17, 12:32 - Lulu: And more susceptible to drugs as an escape
02/07/17, 12:33 - Didier: Oh yeah
02/07/17, 12:33 - Amin: We are kind of add also
02/07/17, 12:33 - Amin: Attention deficit disorder
02/07/17, 12:35 - Amin: Ok send me some thing interesting to read please
02/07/17, 12:35 - Didier: Yes
02/07/17, 12:35 - Didier: I noticed that different mbti types r more susceptible to some disorders
02/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: I think I'm starting to develop add especially in school...
02/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: I can't focus
02/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: It wasn't as bad last time
02/07/17, 12:37 - Lulu: Do you feel the need to move around and such
02/07/17, 12:38 - Didier: Yep
02/07/17, 12:38 - Didier: I am becoming more fidgety than ever
02/07/17, 12:39 - Lulu: Do you have an habits that you can maybe subconsciously focus on
02/07/17, 12:40 - Didier: Like?
02/07/17, 12:40 - Didier: I think so
02/07/17, 12:40 - Didier: I try to
02/07/17, 12:41 - Lulu: Idk like tapping or leg movements or such
02/07/17, 12:41 - Didier: Yeah
02/07/17, 12:41 - Didier: I tap the table
02/07/17, 12:41 - Didier: Or sometimes with my feet
02/07/17, 12:41 - Lulu: Does that help you focus more
02/07/17, 12:41 - Didier: Hmm,not exactly,but after that I try to return to the topic
02/07/17, 12:42 - Lulu: It's really a lot about conditioning yourself to realize when ur zoning out
02/07/17, 12:42 - Lulu: And redirecting yourself to the topic
02/07/17, 12:44 - Didier: Do u have add or sth?
02/07/17, 12:45 - Lulu: Nah but in the later half of my senior year I developed some pretty bad anxiety that would get me jittery and off track in my brain in similar ways
02/07/17, 12:45 - Lulu: Like when I felt the anxiety pressing down I would be jittery as fuck
02/07/17, 12:46 - Lulu: It was mostly in this one class that I really needed to pass too which didn't help lol
02/07/17, 12:46 - Didier: When what happens?
02/07/17, 12:46 - Didier: Ik that feeling haha
02/07/17, 12:46 - Didier: It's worse if the teacher's teaching method doesn't help
02/07/17, 12:47 - Lulu: I was lucky to have a rly understanding teacher
02/07/17, 12:48 - Lulu: Like we never talked directly about anything but I could tell that he could tell that I was struggling in some ways
02/07/17, 12:48 - Lulu: Also I was SAP'd at a point and I think they inform the teachers when they do that
02/07/17, 12:49 - Lulu: SAP is basically student assistance program and it happens when a student or staff member reports it for you being a possible danger to yourself or others
02/07/17, 12:50 - Lulu: Ranges from threatening violence to self harm lol
02/07/17, 12:51 - Lulu: I just feel lucky to have the teachers I had that year, I'm grateful TBH they really helped me along
02/07/17, 12:51 - Lulu: Without hand holding either
02/07/17, 12:54 - Didier: That's good,because mine's not understanding...
02/07/17, 12:55 - Didier: Our personalities just can't understand each other
02/07/17, 12:57 - Didier: But I have one good teacher.She doesn't know about my problems though
02/07/17, 12:57 - Amin: Cool
02/07/17, 12:57 - Didier: Why did u get SAPd
02/07/17, 12:58 - Lulu: Probably my grades and noticible lack of motivation to do most things
02/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: U can get SAPd for that?
02/07/17, 12:58 - Lulu: I was very at risk for failing the year
02/07/17, 12:59 - Lulu: And I had problems in the past,
02/07/17, 12:59 - Lulu: They usually don't take sapping lightly so IDK some other stuff probably?
02/07/17, 12:59 - Lulu: The year before was also bad
02/07/17, 12:59 - Lulu: And the year before that was the worst but no one noticed then
02/07/17, 13:00 - Didier: U r fine now?Much better than before yeah?
02/07/17, 13:00 - Lulu: I was depressed as fuck in grade 10
02/07/17, 13:00 - Lulu: Yeah honestly definitely way better
02/07/17, 13:00 - Didier: Wait,u r in college now right?I hope it'll be the same for me
02/07/17, 13:01 - Lulu: No more feeling numb, or like a lump of heavy skin that can't get out of bed  bed
02/07/17, 13:01 - Lulu: Hopefully!
02/07/17, 13:01 - Lulu: I start in August
02/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: Haha I'm glad for you
02/07/17, 13:02 - Didier: How did u overcome that?
02/07/17, 13:02 - Lulu: I am doing two years general studies at a community then transferring IDK what I wanna do yet
02/07/17, 13:02 - Lulu: Well
02/07/17, 13:02 - Lulu: I just came to a point
02/07/17, 13:02 - Lulu: Idk it was about two months into that summer vacation
02/07/17, 13:03 - Lulu: Which I had been in bed doing nothing for all my days
02/07/17, 13:03 - Lulu: It just came to a point where I started hating myself hated feeling nothing and hated
02/07/17, 13:03 - Lulu: Just it
02/07/17, 13:04 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/07/17, 13:04 - Lulu: I felt like I was wasting away physically and mentally and I was wasting my life and thoughts like that would usually fuel the bad thoughts but after feeling nothing for a while rage was nice
02/07/17, 13:04 - Lulu: I think I kind of took that?
02/07/17, 13:04 - Lulu: And
02/07/17, 13:04 - Lulu: Went forward
02/07/17, 13:04 - Lulu: Idk
02/07/17, 13:05 - Lulu: I honestly don't remember much I'm speculating a bit but I remember feeling like a piece of shit
02/07/17, 13:05 - Amin: Lulu, do you read news?
02/07/17, 13:05 - Lulu: I basically told myself to stop being a little bitch and live the life I haf
02/07/17, 13:05 - Lulu: Not actively, although I should
02/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: I have a question
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: Have*
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: He?
02/07/17, 13:06 - Didier: Wait,so as time passed,it just became better and u got better?
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: Hm*
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: Well not exactly
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: There were relapses
02/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: Is economist hard to understand for native Americans to?
02/07/17, 13:06 - Lulu: Here and there
02/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: Too*
02/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: To*
02/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: Oh God😂
02/07/17, 13:07 - Lulu: I don't quite get that question tbh
02/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: Economist is a newspaper
02/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: Ok check this
02/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21724435-worlds-biggest-landlocked-country-open-business-only-half-ready-it-kazakhstan
02/07/17, 13:07 - Didier: Yeah there were relapses but in the end,everything became better?
02/07/17, 13:08 - Lulu: It was a lot about redirecting myself and finding things I liked in myself instead of despised, although I'd have panic attacks when I felt numbness creeping in because I was afraid of it
02/07/17, 13:08 - Amin: Is it easy for you to understand @14843534493 ?
02/07/17, 13:09 - Lulu: Yeah pretty easy
02/07/17, 13:09 - Didier: I'm not American,but it's ok I guess.I just don't understand the content because I don't read it
02/07/17, 13:09 - Amin: I hate you 😔😔😭😭
02/07/17, 13:09 - Lulu: Lol
02/07/17, 13:10 - Amin: Its very hard for me, and guess what, I am an economics undergrad
02/07/17, 13:10 - Amin: Actually Im a bachelor
02/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: Haha my panic attacks only happen when there r people around me.I feel numbness too but I don't have it with panic attacks.
02/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: 😂
02/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: Find another article
02/07/17, 13:11 - Amin: No way
02/07/17, 13:11 - Amin: I never back down
02/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: Same language level
02/07/17, 13:11 - Lulu: You kind of need to keep working at it, it became easier over time and harder at points when My anxiety developed in  my senior year. I can't say that it will stay this way or that it is definitely better but I would say currently this is the best spot I have been at in my life for a while
02/07/17, 13:12 - Didier: But a topic easier for u to understand first?
02/07/17, 13:12 - Amin: Process of fast learning
02/07/17, 13:15 - Lulu: I know what kind of future and I want but I have no idea what kind of job I want
02/07/17, 13:15 - Lulu: Teaching, physical therapy, possibly massage therapy, pharmacy,
02/07/17, 13:16 - Lulu: Idk man
02/07/17, 13:16 - Lulu: Then I lean more and more towards art again but graphic design seems like a pain
02/07/17, 13:16 - Lulu: Animating seems nice but wh
02/07/17, 13:16 - Lulu: He*
02/07/17, 13:33 - Mohamed: It's pretty known that INTPs can be misunderstood quite often، even by people who knows them well, my question is : how much does it bother you ? 
I personally don't care much if someone misunderstood something i said or did, but it gets annoying when he thinks he has me all figured out and start taking action to help me with "a problem" he/she assumed existed.
02/07/17, 13:33 - ‪+593 98 708 3360‬ saiu
02/07/17, 13:35 - Lulu: See if someone misunderstands a point I'm making I try to clarify but if they assume my character through a short amount of interactions that they mistook then whatever
02/07/17, 13:37 - Lulu: But then you have the people that get all offended when you try to explain your Points because they take correction and explanation as "you're so full of yourself you think you're better than me you think I'm dumb"
02/07/17, 13:39 - Mohamed: It got very annoying when people keep telling me i should do that and don't do that in order to solve my problems, while there are actually no problems at all, just me being me
02/07/17, 13:40 - Mohamed: A lot of people sees my "need to stay away from social interaction" as a sign of depression
02/07/17, 13:51 - Didier: Yeah.Even if there are problems,you help,not just talk
02/07/17, 13:51 - Didier: That's just introversion...
02/07/17, 13:56 - Didier: Yes totally agree
02/07/17, 13:56 - Didier: Most people use religion in a wrong way
02/07/17, 13:59 - Didier: Yeah.If he isn't in the state to take care of himself,he can't take care of a country
02/07/17, 14:01 - Didier: He is already unfit to have those political responsibilities then.Even if he didn't kill himself,a new president will be needed.
02/07/17, 14:01 - Didier: Yep exactly
02/07/17, 14:02 - Maureen: well, in german "assisted suicide" is called "help to die" and suicide is "self murder"...
02/07/17, 14:02 - Maureen: so we make a literal distinction
02/07/17, 14:02 - Didier: Sometimes u have to adopt different perspectives.It might be difficult/painful at times,but it helps to understand this world better so that we can make it a better place
02/07/17, 14:02 - Didier: Oh
02/07/17, 14:05 - Didier: Well there r other ways but it's not that they refuse to see it,it's not a choice for them anymore
02/07/17, 14:05 - Didier: It depends
02/07/17, 14:07 - Didier: It's not a choice.It's just a psychological process,which means it's a natural process for humans
02/07/17, 14:08 - Didier: If humans did not have mental processes,we would be dead and those problems wouldn't have existed
02/07/17, 14:08 - Didier: It's when those psychological processes get fucked up,other psychological processes get created and that's where u get ur mental disorders
02/07/17, 14:09 - Didier: are*
02/07/17, 14:09 - Didier: That's why u have people who can understand u and people who can't
02/07/17, 14:09 - Didier: Different experiences wire a mind
02/07/17, 14:16 - Didier: Yeah.Duty is something we ourselves created.We feel that we have responsibilities,that we are inclined to do what makes us belong here.But who knows what happens when that sense of duty is gone
02/07/17, 14:21 - Didier: Samw
02/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: 😂 Maureen vs Amin
02/07/17, 14:25 - Maureen: 😂
02/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: I wonder where is Fabio
02/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: Yall can't battle anymore
02/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: It is his quote?
02/07/17, 14:28 - Arne: I "snap" my wrist
02/07/17, 14:29 - Didier: Snap?U mean u bend it and there will be a sound?
02/07/17, 14:32 - Didier: 🤔 nvr tried that
02/07/17, 14:32 - Arne: Yeah
02/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: How do u do that
02/07/17, 14:33 - Arne: It is very annoying, because it ain't that good for my wrist
02/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: I wanna try now (curious,just once) 😆
02/07/17, 14:33 - Arne: Dont
02/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: It's addictive?
02/07/17, 14:33 - Arne: Not everyone has it
02/07/17, 14:33 - Arne: It is
02/07/17, 14:33 - Arne: And it doesn't feel good
02/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: I crack my knuckles now to help me
02/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: If not my hands feel uncomfortable
02/07/17, 14:34 - Arne: I do that too, just like my ankles and my big toe
02/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: Ankles O.o
02/07/17, 14:34 - Arne: Also my neck, which is bad too
02/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: Yeah same,not my wrist though
02/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: I'm curious now haha
02/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: I get tense there and I have to do that
02/07/17, 14:35 - Arne: And about my wrist, I can do it two ways
02/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: So the neck is not so bad
02/07/17, 14:35 - Arne: Two different ways.*
02/07/17, 14:36 - Arne: No it is bad for your neck.
02/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: Maybe we do it differently haha
02/07/17, 14:36 - Arne: Probably
02/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: Mine is because my body gets tense
02/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: And it aches
02/07/17, 14:37 - Arne: And also, I can dislocated my shoulder if I wanted.
02/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: Thanks to that,I'm a pro with cracking my knuckles now haha.I wasn't able to do it last time
02/07/17, 14:37 - Arne: Never did it totally out of it, but a little bit is ok
02/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: Wow,can't do that
02/07/17, 14:38 - Arne: I'm not so good in cracking buckles, but everytime I do, at least some of them will
02/07/17, 14:39 - Maureen: I do my ankle too but in may I got a swollen ankle and since then I can't do it anymore 😐
02/07/17, 14:39 - Didier: I do it for my big toe or my second toe to
02/07/17, 14:39 - Didier: too*
02/07/17, 14:39 - Didier: Or sometimes the area with all my toes if I feel a need to
02/07/17, 14:39 - Arne: Oh yeah, when I got injuries too around my ankle, I can't do it either. But I never had a real big injury, lucky for me
02/07/17, 14:40 - Didier: Like I just step back and stand on it
02/07/17, 14:40 - Didier: Dk how to say
02/07/17, 14:40 - Arne: I had some days, when I just walked in my house without shoes, that my big toe instant cracked
02/07/17, 14:40 - Didier: I only do that accidentally.But when it's accidental,it actually feels nice
02/07/17, 14:41 - Didier: Hahaha
02/07/17, 14:41 - Didier: Btw,leg sprains
02/07/17, 14:41 - Didier: How many did u have and how was it?
02/07/17, 14:42 - Didier: I only had 1 and it hurt like hell at first.After 3 days,it was fine though.Embarrassing story behind it
02/07/17, 14:42 - Arne: When I stretch my leg, and put my feet up, so the muscle has some tense, and bend it, it also cracks
02/07/17, 14:42 - Didier: ankle*
02/07/17, 14:43 - Maureen: my knee cracks
02/07/17, 14:43 - Maureen: you mean ankle sprains?
02/07/17, 14:43 - Didier: Yep
02/07/17, 14:43 - Didier: Ignore the leg 😂
02/07/17, 14:43 - Arne: When I get up, from a sitting, my knee cracks a little too
02/07/17, 14:44 - Didier: But how do u even bend ur wrists I'm gonna find out now
02/07/17, 14:44 - Didier: crack*
02/07/17, 14:45 - Arne: Don't
02/07/17, 14:45 - Arne: I tell you
02/07/17, 14:45 - Maureen: I had 2 ankle sprains. one because I felt one leg being numb and got up. I didn't feel the other one tho and landed on the ground when I took a step...
02/07/17, 14:45 - Arne: The "normal" crack of your wrists you can do by holding your hand horizontal, and put it to the left or right, you can get a sound
02/07/17, 14:46 - Didier: Well I don't think I cracked my wrist but I heard a sound.I think I'm just relieving all the tension.I just pushed my whole palm down towards my wrist
02/07/17, 14:46 - Arne: But I have also the "bad" crack
02/07/17, 14:46 - Didier: A slight sound only
02/07/17, 14:46 - Didier: A good not bad one 😂
02/07/17, 14:46 - Arne: That is not how I do it
02/07/17, 14:46 - Maureen: the other one in may which was an inflammation (but I thought it was sprained until 3 weeks ago) and it's still swollen
02/07/17, 14:46 - Didier: I should stop cracking my fingers though
02/07/17, 14:46 - Didier: It's weird
02/07/17, 14:46 - Arne: You may also crack your shoulder
02/07/17, 14:47 - Maureen: do you also get those stares when you crack in public?
02/07/17, 14:47 - Didier: 😂 I had it when I danced and there was a bed near me and I tripped over it
02/07/17, 14:47 - Arne: There was a study about it someone cracked his knuckles like 5 times a day for 10 years, almost no difference with someone who didn't.
02/07/17, 14:47 - Didier: I was like wth happened and nobody was there to help me,which made it worse
02/07/17, 14:48 - Didier: Hmm,I'll search it up then
02/07/17, 14:48 - Arne: Don't know it for sure, didn't read it myself, but a friend told me he did
02/07/17, 14:49 - Didier: Can't haha.I think it's uncomfortable.Thank god
02/07/17, 14:49 - Arne: Haha
02/07/17, 14:49 - Didier: Not sure actually 😂 a bit at least I think
02/07/17, 14:49 - Didier: My classmates
02/07/17, 14:50 - Didier: I thought I must look like a weirdo in front of them
02/07/17, 14:50 - Didier: Like I'm cracking my body  during class
02/07/17, 14:51 - Arne: I got someone in my class who does the same. When he cracked his knuckles it is very easy to hear
02/07/17, 14:53 - Didier: I don't think mine is loud though.Mine is a gentler kind haha but still cracks
02/07/17, 14:53 - Didier: I know one painful way to crack ur fingers.I don't do it though
02/07/17, 14:54 - Didier: My sister does it to other people.It's only not painful sometimes.Ur nail faces u and u push the nail towards the third section of ur finger(inwards)
02/07/17, 14:55 - Didier: Ok this time it's loud 😂
02/07/17, 14:55 - Maureen: I do it that way - not painful to me
02/07/17, 14:55 - Didier: It depends haha.Not painful for my sister but painful for me.It's painful for most ppl tho I think
02/07/17, 14:55 - Maureen: or is it painful when somebody else does it to you?
02/07/17, 14:56 - Didier: Yeah.But it's painful when I do it to myself too 😂
02/07/17, 14:56 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 14:58 - Didier: So that's what u mean,can't do it haha
02/07/17, 14:58 - Didier: It looks cool actually
02/07/17, 14:59 - Didier: Now I have to search up on this haha

02/07/17, 15:02 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>

02/07/17, 15:03 - Maureen: I think it's +56

02/07/17, 15:15 - Arne: Eto'o was the player I liked the most
02/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: He played very beautifull
02/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: There players more successfull than him
02/07/17, 15:15 - Arne: He did! Unfortunately he was before my time
02/07/17, 15:15 - Amin: But he played very beautifull
02/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: Such a shame 😔

02/07/17, 15:21 - Maureen: 1
02/07/17, 15:23 - Maureen: it's not about success
02/07/17, 15:24 - Maureen: it's about their play and what they mean to a team
02/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: Hahaha 7-1
02/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: In that case messi is a very good team player
02/07/17, 15:24 - Maureen: never said that
02/07/17, 15:25 - Didier: 7-1 is a lot of difference
02/07/17, 15:25 - Maureen: 4 or 5 goals were within 20 minutes
02/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: Thomas muller is a very good player too
02/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: Pretty good scorer
02/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: Thomas Müller 😍
02/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: Very intelligent
02/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: Manuel Neuer as well
02/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: best goal keeper
02/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: also best meme ever
02/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: Yeah, it was going to be dangerous for them
02/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: Very good also in going forward, he sometimes go risky though
02/07/17, 15:27 - Maureen: in the end they weren't playing, they were analizing how they could leave the stadium safely
02/07/17, 15:27 - Maureen: but he knows what to do
02/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: Exactly, that was pretty smart
02/07/17, 15:27 - Maureen: he's never careless
02/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: Yeah he is very sharp
02/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: And very agile
02/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: Boateng has e serious role in diffence too
02/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: He is very strong
02/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: K, I have to tell you about the Manuel Neuer meme: we had this coke zero commercial. a hot girl tells her BF "maybe its not a real coke but coke zero. maybe I'm not your girlfriend, but Manuel Neuer. And we won't watch the game [at home] but [in the stadium]. and after the game we won't celebrate backstage but in bed. not as Manuel Neuer"
02/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: so "maybe I'm not xy but Manuel Neuer" is huuuuge
02/07/17, 15:31 - Amin: She looks sluty 😂
02/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: "American guys have trust issues because their girlfriend wears make up. German guys have trust issues because their girlfriend might be Manuel Neuer "
02/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: I wish I was manuel noire in that case
02/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: You know how much I appreciate girls beauty
02/07/17, 15:32 - Maureen: <Mídia omitida>
02/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: He is a wild giant
02/07/17, 15:33 - Maureen: good to have boateng as a neighbour
02/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: Seriously
02/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: 😂😂
02/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: I think others does not have sufficient info about soccer
02/07/17, 15:34 - Maureen: a right wing politician said he wouldn't want Boateng as a neighbour - because of the skin color and the African background. every sane person was furious. and then boateng saved the ball out of the goal. Neuer was glad to have Boateng as a neighbour 😂
02/07/17, 15:34 - Maureen: only about my team and important cups

02/07/17, 16:57 - Didier: I don't see us any different from animals other than more complex thinking
02/07/17, 16:57 - Didier: Probably the only creature that can ponder about our own existence
02/07/17, 16:58 - FABIO: and cars... we have cars... it makes all the difference

02/07/17, 17:06 - Amin: Monkeys can talk?!
02/07/17, 17:06 - FABIO: 😏😏
02/07/17, 17:06 - Didier: Well,they communicate at least?
02/07/17, 17:06 - FABIO: i think.. if monkeys learn to talk and use tools.. we will slave then
02/07/17, 17:07 - Didier: Um,I hope u enjoy it
02/07/17, 17:07 - FABIO: oh i do.... believe me
02/07/17, 17:07 - FABIO: 😈
02/07/17, 17:07 - Didier: I can imagine it.Scary actually.Enslaving those animals
02/07/17, 17:07 - Amin: This is sick
02/07/17, 17:08 - FABIO: dont think so... it will be something like apple`s factory in china
02/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: We are talking meta cognitive
02/07/17, 17:08 - FABIO: we will make then pay taxes and stuff
02/07/17, 17:08 - FABIO: basically slavery.. from their point of view now
02/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: It goes for stuff like contemplating about our being
02/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: And about our thoughts
02/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: And learning stuff
02/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: Reasoning
02/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: I dont know
02/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Some thing came to my mind
02/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Did monkeys evolve them selves to human?
02/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Like consciously?
02/07/17, 17:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Of course not

02/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's all suddenly a lot more fun
02/07/17, 17:12 - Amin: Once we were reasoning why we need sun
02/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Wtf

02/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: He is funny
02/07/17, 17:13 - Didier: I am reading the article that I realise there is so much more to go.The article is long
02/07/17, 17:13 - Didier: then*
02/07/17, 17:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I usually just get high alone
02/07/17, 17:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: So none of those problems
02/07/17, 17:15 - Didier: Ok maybe it's not as bad as I thought but we will still enslave them?
02/07/17, 17:15 - Didier: So,what's the conclusion of the article
02/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: That monkeys can learn and improve them selves I guess
02/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: And thats not good to hear
02/07/17, 17:17 - Didier: Well,it seems like they are rather intelligent animals from what I noticed
02/07/17, 17:17 - Didier: They can be good at stealing
02/07/17, 17:18 - Didier: What else
02/07/17, 17:19 - Didier: Monkeys attacking humans
02/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: Yeah
02/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: I think this is just a phase
02/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: I cant trust the article
02/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: So monkeys have philosophers?
02/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: 😂😂
02/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: Spinosa version of monkey
02/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: 😂😂
02/07/17, 17:27 - Didier: https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/06/03/dying-may-not-be-that-bad-after-all/121430.html

I think that this is a good and interesting article.Read the whole thing.
02/07/17, 17:29 - Didier: Maybe they r meta cognitive in a more subtle way
02/07/17, 17:31 - Amin: Wow, thar was awsome👌
02/07/17, 17:31 - Amin: I like your psychology taste

03/07/17, 00:04 - Janith: Yes it is
03/07/17, 00:05 - Janith: Welcome
03/07/17, 00:10 - Lulu: Hello
03/07/17, 00:14 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Hii
03/07/17, 00:14 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I just found out that i'm an intp
03/07/17, 00:15 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I dont know how to interact with society
03/07/17, 00:18 - Janith: Well.. I'm actually not too great with that either
03/07/17, 00:19 - Janith: I try to avoid interaction unless necessary
03/07/17, 00:19 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Smartest thing to do
03/07/17, 00:19 - Janith: But when I do I prefer to emulate the types I'm talking to
03/07/17, 00:20 - Janith: It's basically an unconscious reaction
03/07/17, 00:20 - Janith: It makes INTPs seem a lot more sociable than they are
03/07/17, 00:33 - Lulu: Basically me my whole life
03/07/17, 00:33 - Lulu: Lol
03/07/17, 00:34 - Lulu: I feel bad like I'm being fake when I do that because I am aware of it but it also doesn't really feel fake ?
03/07/17, 00:34 - Lulu: Idk
03/07/17, 00:35 - Lulu: I just read into bits of their personalities and comfort towards certain actions
03/07/17, 00:37 - Imeldaroswara: I don't see it as being fake person. 

I see it as me being the "kind" INTP that I am...trying to submit to the society's expectation, giving people what they "think" they need and not what "I think" they need.

Though this is not applicable to my family and closest friends. LOL..
03/07/17, 00:38 - Lulu: Same
03/07/17, 00:39 - Lulu: I don't see it as fake but I also make sure to catch myself when I play into it too much
03/07/17, 00:40 - Lulu: Cuz I still kinda try to act like me
03/07/17, 00:40 - Imeldaroswara: I read in pinterest...something like... An alien trying to learn humans' emotion and they decide to study it from INTP person.
Oh boy...oh boy...
03/07/17, 00:40 - Imeldaroswara: It gets me exhausted pretty quickly...usually..
03/07/17, 00:42 - Juancho: @94754191589, i'm currently looking into both Chaos and Group theory; I encourage you to quickly browse through the rather compendious definition given by Wikipedia and if abstract math is something you're fond of then do look into it as well.
03/07/17, 00:43 - Imeldaroswara: Is it...something like the chaos will one day turn to order and likewise...the order will turn to chaos...?
03/07/17, 00:44 - Janith: Aand you gave me a reason to jump out of bed 😂
Thanks and I'll check it out
03/07/17, 00:44 - Imeldaroswara: Oh..probably not..
03/07/17, 00:47 - Juancho: Hahahaha. Just reciprocating the favor for you.
03/07/17, 00:48 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I only speak well to people I know very well
03/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Exactly
03/07/17, 00:55 - Amin: But the point is, INTPs are most introvert types beside INTJs
03/07/17, 01:10 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah...during the weekdays..I always plan for weekend..going to this exhibition..that museum..etc..
But when the weekend comes.. I will be hermit...hiding in my room...

S*cks....because so many beautiful/fun things can be enjoyed outside of my room...but my brain just don't allow it.

I wonder when we will have virtual museum/exhibition... So I can enjoy them from the comfort of my bed.
03/07/17, 01:12 - Amin: Hmmm, Laziness plays a role in that too, I love my room so much too 😅
03/07/17, 01:13 - Amin: My pillow
03/07/17, 01:13 - Amin: I love my pillow too

03/07/17, 02:05 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 02:11 - Imeldaroswara: 👍🏻
03/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: Used to be mine too. But recently I've been getting better at reeling it in. To the point where u almost became an intj 😂
03/07/17, 02:16 - Imeldaroswara: Traitor. ..😅
03/07/17, 02:17 - Janith: 😂 not yet though. I may be getting better at focus but I'm still as nutty as most INTPs
03/07/17, 02:18 - Imeldaroswara: 3 jobs that suited INTP, I think:
1. Freelance Programmer
2. Novel thriller writer
3. ....I forget....LOL..
03/07/17, 02:23 - Janith: What about mad scientist that almost takes over the world 😜
03/07/17, 02:23 - Janith: In theory 😂
03/07/17, 02:24 - Imeldaroswara: I thought that is secret mission that all INTP knows ever since their birth... (by default)
03/07/17, 02:25 - Imeldaroswara: I don't like to imagine the end of the world...
But I love to imagine perfect crime...or perfect murder... LOL...
03/07/17, 02:25 - Imeldaroswara: Not that I have someone that I need to eliminate... 😆
03/07/17, 02:26 - Imeldaroswara: That's why conan and QED were my favorite mangas...
03/07/17, 02:29 - Amin: Try ted
03/07/17, 02:30 - Amin: God bless you
03/07/17, 02:30 - Amin: Booooooooo😂😂
03/07/17, 02:30 - Imeldaroswara: I think they have another one..opposite of TED....something like doing action instead of just talking..
I forget the name.
03/07/17, 02:31 - Amin: 👌👌
03/07/17, 02:32 - Amin: TED is sometimes pure crap, like this one

03/07/17, 04:34 - Amin: Articles approved by ISI
03/07/17, 04:34 - Juancho: In my country 6/10 people use eyeglasses
03/07/17, 04:34 - Amin: are approved by universities you apply too
03/07/17, 04:34 - Juancho: But this is only true for teens
03/07/17, 04:34 - Juancho: And 20yr olds
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: So i've been thinking about it hard
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: For a whole 3 days
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: I reached a conclusiono
03/07/17, 04:35 - Amin: Wait
03/07/17, 04:35 - Amin: Write it bold
03/07/17, 04:35 - Janith: Increased time studying and staring at books under artificial lighting increases the prevalence of myopia in children
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: Which I plan on submitting it to the government
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: See
03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: That's the thing

03/07/17, 04:35 - Juancho: In my country
03/07/17, 04:36 - Juancho: The poverty rate is at 60%+
03/07/17, 04:36 - Juancho: They can't afford phones with led screens

03/07/17, 04:37 - Amin: Thats why we love carrots
03/07/17, 04:38 - Juancho: And the main food these poor people eat are rice and these things called TORTILLAS
03/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: Yes. Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness
03/07/17, 04:38 - Juancho: Rice is low on vitamin A
03/07/17, 04:38 - FABIO: I like tortillas
03/07/17, 04:38 - FABIO: 😂😂
03/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: So there's a vitamin A deficiency in the population?
03/07/17, 04:38 - Juancho: And the eyeglass phenomena is only true for poor people
03/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: I suggest getting the farmers to switch to Golden rice
03/07/17, 04:38 - Juancho: Yes
03/07/17, 04:38 - Juancho: Precisely
03/07/17, 04:39 - Juancho: Golden rice?

03/07/17, 04:39 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: i think someone in your government can see that already
03/07/17, 04:39 - Juancho: ?
03/07/17, 04:39 - Amin: Same thought here
03/07/17, 04:39 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: but they tend to ignore it
03/07/17, 04:39 - Amin: Exactly

03/07/17, 04:42 - Juancho: Hahaha. Exactly my point
03/07/17, 04:42 - Janith: I think the government should be able to distribute golden rice strains to farmers and subsidize its growth in the early ears
03/07/17, 04:42 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: cmiiw, youre western but modify rice

03/07/17, 04:56 - Janith: You got the ranks from a report
03/07/17, 04:56 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: i can confirm this
03/07/17, 04:56 - Amin: Juancho did
03/07/17, 04:57 - Amin: Ive just accepted what he said
03/07/17, 04:57 - Janith: We have something like that in our country too. Sure the idiots are all around throughout the country but they're not taken seriously except by other idiots
03/07/17, 04:57 - Amin: Because he is japanese
03/07/17, 04:57 - Amin: 😂😂
03/07/17, 04:57 - Juancho: Anyways. My theory is this: during wwll, scholars were the ones to not serve in the war. These along with rich people of higher IQs were salvaged from death. Most of the offspring cane from these people.
03/07/17, 04:58 - Janith: Sorry. Both your messages have the same shade of blue today
03/07/17, 04:58 - Juancho: Although now that I think about it

03/07/17, 05:18 - Janith: You need to remember that the measure is highly subjective and not a very good measure of intelligence
03/07/17, 05:18 - Amin: Seriously, celebrities rock

03/07/17, 05:19 - Juancho: Ding ding ding. You got it.
03/07/17, 05:19 - Amin: They are cool though
03/07/17, 05:19 - FABIO: but i do believe.. if i test again today.. i will pass 130 easy
03/07/17, 05:20 - Amin: The test is bullshit
03/07/17, 05:20 - Janith: I don't know but here's what you should feel. 
The guy with the highest iq in the world is currently a run of the mill engineer in South Korea

03/07/17, 05:20 - FABIO: iq is all about patter recognition and math
03/07/17, 05:20 - Amin: Thats what they tell about me
03/07/17, 05:20 - Janith: Their existence is purely for the entertainment of the masses
03/07/17, 05:20 - Juancho: Not at all.

03/07/17, 05:59 - Janith: Because I find appearances uninteresting
03/07/17, 05:59 - Juancho: Couldn't have defined it better.
03/07/17, 05:59 - Amin: I rather porn
03/07/17, 05:59 - Amin: Not gram

03/07/17, 05:59 - FABIO: social things.. are important
03/07/17, 05:59 - FABIO: not as science.. but still.
03/07/17, 05:59 - Amin: Shallow
03/07/17, 05:59 - FABIO: its life
03/07/17, 05:59 - Amin: 😂😂
03/07/17, 06:00 - FABIO: no shallow.. true
03/07/17, 06:00 - FABIO: =D
03/07/17, 06:00 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 06:00 - Janith: Wow. I would dump her faster than a tachyon 😂
03/07/17, 06:00 - Juancho: Check this girl out
03/07/17, 06:00 - Amin: Honest but shallow
03/07/17, 06:00 - Amin: Sure
03/07/17, 06:00 - FABIO: its just the truth
03/07/17, 06:00 - FABIO: i wouldnt have talked to her.. if she wasnt pretty either
03/07/17, 06:00 - Janith: It's not the only form of living @554691068741
03/07/17, 06:00 - Juancho: Ahh
03/07/17, 06:00 - FABIO: appearence.. matters
03/07/17, 06:01 - Janith: It does in certain circles
03/07/17, 06:01 - Juancho: Nothing better than drifting off into a completely random conversation at 3 am
03/07/17, 06:01 - FABIO: 6 here
03/07/17, 06:01 - Amin: Dude you should have raped her in school
03/07/17, 06:01 - FABIO: big test today
03/07/17, 06:01 - FABIO: woke up cant sleep anymore
03/07/17, 06:01 - FABIO: hahahahaha
03/07/17, 06:01 - Janith: But it serves no purpose for me. Appearances wither away. Personalities don't
03/07/17, 06:01 - Juancho: Wtf are we doing with our lives?
03/07/17, 06:02 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
03/07/17, 06:02 - Janith: I'm currently debating whether or not to work some more or read
03/07/17, 06:02 - Amin: Depends on ur purpose of relation
03/07/17, 06:02 - Janith: Can't decide so procrastinating
03/07/17, 06:02 - FABIO: i think you can have both
03/07/17, 06:02 - FABIO: so.. why not?
03/07/17, 06:02 - Amin: Time is gold
03/07/17, 06:02 - Juancho: Depends
03/07/17, 06:02 - FABIO: appearence AND personality
03/07/17, 06:03 - Juancho: Me everyday
03/07/17, 06:03 - Janith: True. Ideal situation
03/07/17, 06:03 - FABIO: its what i try to do with me
03/07/17, 06:03 - Janith: But for me the latter is essential
03/07/17, 06:03 - FABIO: and wat i want for me..
03/07/17, 06:03 - Janith: I can't notice the former if the latter sucks
03/07/17, 06:03 - Juancho: Then it blows up in my face and somehow manage to salvage whatever it is i was trying to do or was supposed to do
03/07/17, 06:04 - Janith: Or if she's hot both and isn't intelligent or passionate about the field she's in
03/07/17, 06:04 - Janith: *intelligent and passionate
03/07/17, 06:04 - Janith: Beauty is a dime a dozen
03/07/17, 06:05 - Juancho: Like I said before. I will only mary a girl with a high iq.
03/07/17, 06:05 - Juancho: And decent looking of course
03/07/17, 06:05 - FABIO: Marry
03/07/17, 06:05 - FABIO: Hahahahhahahaha
03/07/17, 06:05 - Janith: Dude iq is not an accurate measure 😅
03/07/17, 06:05 - Juancho: It is
03/07/17, 06:06 - FABIO: I have the best girl.. and dont wanna marry
03/07/17, 06:06 - Amin: I don't believe in relationships
03/07/17, 06:06 - Amin: I rather pay for sex
03/07/17, 06:06 - FABIO: Not yet
03/07/17, 06:06 - Janith: Also I'm not that big on the idea of marriage either. Just another contract
03/07/17, 06:06 - FABIO: 👆🏻
03/07/17, 06:06 - FABIO: We all do
03/07/17, 06:06 - FABIO: In a way
03/07/17, 06:06 - Juancho: I wouldn't mind a dumb as a rock but hot as fuck gr
03/07/17, 06:06 - Juancho: Gf
03/07/17, 06:06 - Juancho: Just not a wife
03/07/17, 06:06 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂 well said
03/07/17, 06:07 - Janith: Dude she's far from the best if the only reason she's talking to you in the first place is cause you look good
03/07/17, 06:07 - Juancho: I agree. Why tie myself down if it all goes to hell, i'll get fucked over.
03/07/17, 06:07 - FABIO: Nope
03/07/17, 06:07 - FABIO: Its how it works
03/07/17, 06:07 - FABIO: Appearence is for gaining attention
03/07/17, 06:07 - Amin: Janith, Fabio is very connected to his emotions, specially about girls
03/07/17, 06:07 - Janith: My brain tries to kill itself if I even talk to people like that 😶
03/07/17, 06:07 - FABIO: Then you need presobality
03/07/17, 06:08 - Juancho: @94754191589 but you know how it is. Social convention states you have to and the girl will probably want to get married so.
03/07/17, 06:08 - Janith: Fuck that
03/07/17, 06:08 - Amin: Seriously, pure crap dude
03/07/17, 06:08 - Juancho: I'm with people like that whenever I walk out of my house.
03/07/17, 06:08 - Janith: I don't give a damn about what society states unless it benefits me
03/07/17, 06:08 - Juancho: Me to
03/07/17, 06:08 - Amin: Hail
03/07/17, 06:09 - Juancho: But if it means not having kids
03/07/17, 06:09 - Juancho: I'll just make her sign a preenup
03/07/17, 06:09 - Juancho: And no prob
03/07/17, 06:09 - Amin: Juancho how old are you?
03/07/17, 06:09 - Janith: Procreation is overrated 😂
03/07/17, 06:09 - Juancho: 15
03/07/17, 06:09 - FABIO: I want kids
03/07/17, 06:09 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
03/07/17, 06:09 - Amin: You'll change your mind
03/07/17, 06:09 - FABIO: A little intp
03/07/17, 06:09 - Amin: You will be a good father
03/07/17, 06:10 - FABIO: Who will fuck every hot girl in his class
03/07/17, 06:10 - Juancho: I want to have kids with high iqs sow I can teach em all kinds of shit
03/07/17, 06:10 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
03/07/17, 06:10 - Janith: But on a more serious note @50494800614 if you want to have kids and are in the financial position to do so but haven't found someone you could try artificial 😅
03/07/17, 06:10 - Juancho: And they will already know it and become the arrogant assholes i an now

03/07/17, 06:11 - Janith: Mute the group. Try a red filter on the screen and read a boring article
03/07/17, 06:11 - FABIO: 😂😂😂

03/07/17, 07:01 - Imeldaroswara: Totally agree
03/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: Homosexual activity if u don't allow it,I understand because of the recent increase in guys using young boys
03/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: But if u r married to ur partner,why not
03/07/17, 07:02 - Didier: That's why I think I should be one of the law makers here

Hmmm.... Usually in crime series... Oh..the level of arsenic is in this level...yes he is indeed died due to arsenic poison

So, I was thinking... What if there is a substance/plant that can alter the level of arsenic in someone's body, to make it lower. So that even in very very small dosage of arsenic, that person will die.

But then how to test it....
How to perfect the measurements....
Oh....the assasin can work as a chef in a prison...and starts to work to get perfect ratio of the substance and arsenic with someone's body mass.

03/07/17, 09:19 - Janith: Yeah but just think about exactly what we'd need for there to be even sex slaves. Never mind the child variety

03/07/17, 09:21 - Lulu: Amin gave his farewell address that seemed like a sign off and bolted

03/07/17, 09:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I thought he's just going offline
03/07/17, 09:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Anyone offended him?.... Or was that just ....... A dramatic exit ?
03/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: He needs some time to himself
03/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: He's going into hermit mode
03/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: I asked him
03/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah. Sometimes I too need that.
03/07/17, 09:23 - Lulu: Ah okay, I was gonna ask but I don't think he favors me much lmaoo
03/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He said he'll be back
03/07/17, 09:23 - Lulu: Coolio
03/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I guess Didier had a few questions about India...

03/07/17, 09:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This usually happens with me. My gut instincts are often right. Even if they are absolutely random!!!

03/07/17, 09:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I had framed a brief idea myself about it
03/07/17, 09:36 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ttyl
03/07/17, 09:36 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Second class
03/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: Kk ttyl
03/07/17, 09:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Huge ants?
03/07/17, 09:38 - ‪+60 11-1145 0308‬: Cutie??
03/07/17, 09:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol
03/07/17, 09:39 - Didier: What kind of ant is that?It's huge
03/07/17, 09:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: One got into the kitchen somehow
03/07/17, 09:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh there's two more
03/07/17, 09:39 - Didier: Happy living with them
03/07/17, 09:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They react to intense light
03/07/17, 09:40 - Didier: U don't usually see them?
03/07/17, 09:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I do, but I still don't know what you call them
03/07/17, 09:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And they're usually in the garden around the house
03/07/17, 09:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not inside
03/07/17, 09:43 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:42 - Didier: Search this picture on google?I forgot how to do that
03/07/17, 09:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It shows no results
03/07/17, 09:44 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:44 - Didier: Those look like fangs
03/07/17, 09:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Pincers?
03/07/17, 09:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol yeah
03/07/17, 09:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They have those
03/07/17, 09:45 - Didier: Any INTP gardeners lol
03/07/17, 09:45 - Didier: Let me search now
03/07/17, 09:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If they try to bite you, you need to snap their head off to make them stop
03/07/17, 09:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Or else they won't let go of your skin
03/07/17, 09:45 - Didier: Where do u live again?
03/07/17, 09:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: India
03/07/17, 09:46 - Didier: Omg I'm scared of how those creepy crawlies look but I'm still searching them up 😂
03/07/17, 09:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Hahha
03/07/17, 09:50 - Didier: Do those ants sting?
03/07/17, 09:51 - Didier: I think it's a carpenter ant
03/07/17, 09:51 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:51 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:51 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:52 - Lulu: Don't know why I loaded that image
03/07/17, 09:52 - Didier: Hahaha
03/07/17, 09:52 - Lulu: Lol
03/07/17, 09:52 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 09:52 - Arne: 👀
03/07/17, 09:54 - Didier: I used to play trivia crack
03/07/17, 09:54 - Didier: And piano tiles
03/07/17, 09:54 - Arne: I don't play these games anymore too, just still got them
03/07/17, 09:55 - Didier: What is mindfck?
03/07/17, 09:55 - Didier: 666 haha
03/07/17, 09:55 - Arne: Oh you didn't see it?
03/07/17, 09:56 - Didier: Oh colour switch,I played it on my friend's phone and forgot about it.Now I'm gonna download it
03/07/17, 09:56 - Didier: Now I see it
03/07/17, 09:56 - Arne: Haha
03/07/17, 09:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh
03/07/17, 09:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Cool
03/07/17, 09:57 - Lulu: Isn't it great when you give kids paper to draw and they do math
03/07/17, 09:57 - Didier: And when you give kids paper to do math,they draw
03/07/17, 09:58 - Arne: Idk, I like my creativity
03/07/17, 09:59 - Lulu: They draw too
03/07/17, 09:59 - Lulu: But they are eager to learn
03/07/17, 09:59 - Lulu: And that's cute
03/07/17, 09:59 - Lulu: They are also trying to impress me with what they know lol
03/07/17, 10:00 - Arne: Oh that's cool
03/07/17, 10:00 - Didier: Who are those kids?
03/07/17, 10:00 - Lulu: My little cousins
03/07/17, 10:00 - Didier: Haha so cute
03/07/17, 10:01 - Didier: Let thwm know more
03/07/17, 10:01 - Didier: What did they use to impress u?
03/07/17, 10:02 - Lulu: 21 plus one , although they only memorized what it was so I'm trying to teach them more
03/07/17, 10:02 - Lulu: Like if I ask them 32 plus 3 they will add it to the wrong place
03/07/17, 10:03 - Didier: Lol
03/07/17, 10:03 - Didier: Isn't it just 22
03/07/17, 10:03 - Didier: It means they don't know what is addition yet
03/07/17, 10:03 - Maureen: how old are they?
03/07/17, 10:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Maureen outta the blue 😆
03/07/17, 10:05 - Maureen: 🙋🏼
03/07/17, 10:11 - Maureen: so how old are they?
03/07/17, 10:22 - Lulu: 8 7 and 5,they can do basic addition but they get confused about some stuff
03/07/17, 10:25 - Lulu: The one is actually 4 but she's turning 5 soon
03/07/17, 10:25 - Maureen: but 7 and 8 should be able to add 3 to 32
03/07/17, 10:26 - Lulu: They are really smart, sadly IDK what they teach them at school
03/07/17, 10:26 - Maureen: just ask them to add 3 to 2 and let them add 30
03/07/17, 10:26 - Lulu: I know that they really simplify it tho
03/07/17, 10:26 - Lulu: I told them to do it like that
03/07/17, 10:27 - Lulu: But I was also trying to teach them placements
03/07/17, 10:27 - Lulu: Like first and second which I don't know how they don't know
03/07/17, 10:27 - Maureen: what is placements in math?
03/07/17, 10:27 - Lulu: I mean like
03/07/17, 10:27 - Lulu: The first place and second place in 21
03/07/17, 10:27 - Maureen: ah
03/07/17, 10:27 - Lulu: One being the first 2 being second
03/07/17, 10:28 - Maureen: we call it ones, tens, hundreds...
03/07/17, 10:28 - Lulu: Yes we do too
03/07/17, 10:28 - Lulu: Just like for their level
03/07/17, 10:28 - Lulu: Wait
03/07/17, 10:28 - Lulu: That's higher level lol I forget how it went
03/07/17, 10:28 - Maureen: no we keep it that way 😂
03/07/17, 10:29 - Maureen: they start in elementary school and keep it until secondary school
03/07/17, 10:29 - Lulu: Here just for the sake of simplicity they call it first second third and therefore
03/07/17, 10:30 - Lulu: I really don't remember actually
03/07/17, 10:30 - Lulu: Maybe they just call it ones and tens for decimal teaching I think
03/07/17, 10:31 - Maureen: I think when you teach kids the stuff in the first place they will keep it
03/07/17, 10:32 - Maureen: why simplifying when the real thing is close?
03/07/17, 10:32 - Maureen: isn't it more confusing to change terms than to learn one?
03/07/17, 10:33 - Lulu: See I didn't have much stable teaching third through seventh grade because I was in a shirty school lol
03/07/17, 10:33 - Lulu: Idk
03/07/17, 10:33 - Maureen: no, it's also for written calculation
03/07/17, 10:33 - Maureen: like:
  23
+  3
______
  26
03/07/17, 10:34 - Lulu: Yeah
03/07/17, 10:34 - Maureen: it's also good for our multiplication/division system, which us different from US
03/07/17, 10:35 - Lulu: I think here it's first and second for addition and ones and tens for decimals?
03/07/17, 10:35 - Lulu: How does yours work
03/07/17, 10:38 - Maureen: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 10:38 - Lulu: "I cut myself" 
Is it bleeding?
"Noo"
Then you're fine
03/07/17, 10:38 - Lulu: I have said that
03/07/17, 10:38 - Lulu: So many times this morning
03/07/17, 10:39 - Lulu: What on the hell
03/07/17, 10:39 - Lulu: In*
03/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: in school it is:
"I need a band-aid"
"is it bleeding?"
"no"
"then you don't need one"
03/07/17, 10:41 - Lulu: Okay but what's going on in that multiplication
03/07/17, 10:41 - Lulu: Lol
03/07/17, 10:42 - Lulu: Oh wait I see
03/07/17, 10:42 - Maureen: multiplication: first 3x23=69, then 1x23=23 and then add both but take care of the positions...
03/07/17, 10:45 - Lulu: ....
03/07/17, 10:48 - Didier: Ok I get it
03/07/17, 10:49 - Didier: I forgot how we did it in elementary sch but it was diff
03/07/17, 10:50 - Lulu: That's a lot of work for what you get lil
03/07/17, 10:50 - Lulu: Lol
03/07/17, 10:51 - Lulu: Although I guess ours there is a lot more mental math ?
03/07/17, 10:51 - Didier: What about the one on the right?
03/07/17, 10:51 - Didier: Ours Idk but I don't like how math is taught here
03/07/17, 10:52 - Lulu: That's division right
03/07/17, 10:52 - Lulu: Well typically they will have you memorize or gain general understanding of the times tables
03/07/17, 10:53 - Lulu: Then to multiply
03/07/17, 10:53 - Lulu: Hold on
03/07/17, 10:54 - Didier: It's interesting how diff countries have diff teaching style and some may prefer this and the rest may prefer that
03/07/17, 10:54 - Didier: styles*
03/07/17, 10:56 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 10:56 - Lulu: It's actually more steps but more simple for teaching I guess
03/07/17, 11:00 - Didier: Yeah I think we do this too
03/07/17, 11:05 - Maureen: 5:4=1 (in head: 1x4=4) (write under 5) 
5-4=1, get 7 from above
17:4=4 (in head: 4x4=16)
(write 16 under 17)
17-16=1, get 3 from above...

03/07/17, 11:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: So they  just let their heads hang with the wound?

03/07/17, 11:58 - Arne: Is it just by accident you got here too, and he?
03/07/17, 11:59 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I will ask him

03/07/17, 12:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But he does not have that name in the number which I have
03/07/17, 12:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He could have two
03/07/17, 12:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Btw, he is a professional guitarist
03/07/17, 12:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Lead guitarist of our school band
03/07/17, 12:03 - Arne: He didn't, he just random sent that foto
03/07/17, 12:04 - Janith: I was about to kick him out cause I thought he was just here to troll 😂
03/07/17, 12:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I asked him. He says he never joined any group
03/07/17, 12:05 - Maureen: maybe that voldemort guy just used his picture
03/07/17, 12:05 - Arne: But how can he have send a selfie
03/07/17, 12:06 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It could be that someone got that photo from fb. He posted it a few days ago
03/07/17, 12:06 - Arne: Which is not him, but how would the other person would choice his photo
03/07/17, 12:06 - Arne: Unluckily
03/07/17, 12:06 - Arne: I think he is trolling
03/07/17, 12:06 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Definitely
03/07/17, 12:07 - Maureen: @919554137104 maybe you could give him the number of the guy who used his picture
03/07/17, 12:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Faria ?
03/07/17, 12:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That is my sisters name
03/07/17, 12:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Wait
03/07/17, 12:08 - Maureen: isn't it Faraz?
03/07/17, 12:08 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yes
03/07/17, 12:08 - Maureen: but?
03/07/17, 12:09 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This number once belonged to her😒
03/07/17, 12:09 - Maureen: what number?

03/07/17, 12:10 - Arne: So it was her..?
03/07/17, 12:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Who ?
03/07/17, 12:10 - Arne: Your sister
03/07/17, 12:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Voldemort ?
03/07/17, 12:10 - Arne: Sending this random Pic of your friend
03/07/17, 12:10 - Arne: Not into jokes rn, sorry.
03/07/17, 12:11 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My man, for real ?😂
03/07/17, 12:11 - Arne: Oh
03/07/17, 12:12 - Arne: But from who is that other number
03/07/17, 12:12 - Maureen: +91 870799188
03/07/17, 12:12 - Maureen: Faraz, give it to your friend
03/07/17, 12:12 - Arne: Sorry, had read that wrong
03/07/17, 12:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Says he doesn't know
03/07/17, 12:15 - Janith: The mystery intensifies
03/07/17, 12:16 - Arne: He knows about mbti right?
03/07/17, 12:16 - Janith: Anyway that joker is gone now so why bother?
03/07/17, 12:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yes
03/07/17, 12:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 12:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not yet. I am curious
03/07/17, 12:17 - Arne: This makes it more clearer the fact he probably is that person
03/07/17, 12:18 - Arne: Ask him which mbti personality he thinks he is.
03/07/17, 12:18 - Maureen: because there is someone going around sending pictures that don't belong to them
03/07/17, 12:19 - Maureen: but maybe he could text him and ask why using this pic?
03/07/17, 12:19 - Arne: Possible, but it's unlikely
03/07/17, 12:19 - Maureen: why?
03/07/17, 12:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: he is ENFP. We took the test together
03/07/17, 12:19 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
03/07/17, 12:19 - Arne: Exactly that picture, from the millions there are?
03/07/17, 12:20 - Janith: From the lucifer effect
03/07/17, 12:20 - Arne: Yes, but does he really *thinks* he is ENFP?
03/07/17, 12:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But, don't you think that could be said for any pic he would have sent ?
03/07/17, 12:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He is sort of complicated
03/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He tells me that he took the test several times before me and got different results
03/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But, could that really be ?
03/07/17, 12:23 - Arne: Idk, I can't say for real
03/07/17, 12:23 - Arne: Steal his phone tomorrow
03/07/17, 12:24 - Arne: And search for ecidence
03/07/17, 12:24 - Arne: Evidence
03/07/17, 12:24 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That is a piece of cake
03/07/17, 12:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But, did he just pop into the group one fine day and suddenly posted a pic and disappeared ?
03/07/17, 12:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Is THAT not wierd ?
03/07/17, 12:25 - Arne: No, he was here some days, not saying anything at all, or it hadn't anything to do with the subject
03/07/17, 12:26 - Arne: It is
03/07/17, 12:26 - Lulu: Small world? Lol
03/07/17, 12:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: So, during those "some days", all he did was send a pic of my friend's haircut ?
03/07/17, 12:27 - Lulu: I don't think si
03/07/17, 12:27 - Lulu: I remember
03/07/17, 12:27 - Arne: Can't say for sure, but that's what I remembered
03/07/17, 12:27 - Lulu: He said before and aftrr
03/07/17, 12:28 - Lulu: I had a short exchange with him I forget about what

03/07/17, 12:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Oh yeah. I got 1500+ texts within 8hours
03/07/17, 12:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And you must be talking about days
03/07/17, 12:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: So, never mind
03/07/17, 12:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😅😅😂😂
03/07/17, 12:32 - Arne: 😆
03/07/17, 12:33 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I trust my buddy. If he says he didn't do any such rubbish, I trust him
03/07/17, 12:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But
03/07/17, 12:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: If I steal his phone
03/07/17, 12:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I will have to check his chats
03/07/17, 12:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Which have password
03/07/17, 12:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And even if he did , he would have deleted it
03/07/17, 12:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Did anyone save his do?
03/07/17, 12:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: *dp

03/07/17, 12:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Was there any introduction for this guy, or did Lord Voldemort just came in to have his own leasure time ?
03/07/17, 12:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Now this is getting serious.
03/07/17, 12:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This guy........ not only left the group.......
03/07/17, 12:58 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: .....he left WhatsApp
03/07/17, 12:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How's it getting serious
03/07/17, 12:59 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am calling it. Unreachable or switched off.
03/07/17, 12:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What does it matter man
03/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Why are you so concerned
03/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That bastard had my brother's pic. Now he disappeared
03/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He has no identity

03/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well maybe that Bastard was your brother?
03/07/17, 13:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Lets see what I can do with that number tomorrow....
03/07/17, 13:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Any new topic for now ?
03/07/17, 13:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: This is illogical. Fish and mice aren't related at all. Pisces and mammalia. Thus a mouse can't become a fish by being born in an aquarium. On the other hand, whether Muslims or Christians, were Homo sapiens. Thus, a Muslim born in Sweden is Swedish. There's no analogy between the two

03/07/17, 13:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The OP meant to be racist against Muslims
03/07/17, 13:40 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Dude take it easy

03/07/17, 22:35 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: hello
03/07/17, 22:35 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: what topic do we have today?
04/07/17, 00:57 - Imeldaroswara: We're talking about Philip Zimbardo....

I remember I watched him in TEDTalk few years back.

Philip Zimbardo: The psychology of evil
http://go.ted.com/dHkiVA

Janith said: "It's about how situational forces can make even good people do horrible things"

But I was personally thinking, 
isn't that similar like peer pressure in teenage world that can cause a person to do horrible things...?

So, there is no difference between an adult and a teenager. Humans still succumb to the peer pressure, human is social creature after all.
Except maybe INTP... hahaha...
04/07/17, 00:57 - Imeldaroswara: It's closer to midweek madness wednesday... Sigh
04/07/17, 01:58 - Amin: What's the interesting point of this video?
04/07/17, 01:59 - Imeldaroswara: Ah... I thought you went to seclusion.. 😝
04/07/17, 02:01 - Amin: 👆👆👆
04/07/17, 02:01 - Imeldaroswara: It answers the question of whether people are evil by nayure or because of environment.
04/07/17, 02:01 - Imeldaroswara: *nature
04/07/17, 02:02 - Amin: Hmmm... alright, thanks.
04/07/17, 02:07 - Imeldaroswara: He gave example of the abuses in prison in iraq.... Some horrible pictures...
Some prisoner guards abuses their power by torturing the prisoners.
Perhaps some of the guards are "good" people...but because maybe one/two people abuse the power....the others followed.
04/07/17, 02:08 - Imeldaroswara: It made me remember a quote:
Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
04/07/17, 02:38 - Maureen: you don't know the true character of a person until you give them power
04/07/17, 02:38 - Maureen: have you seen the movie "the experiment"?
04/07/17, 03:01 - Janith: Doesn't he describe peer pressure as a contributing factor? He defines it as "groupthink"
04/07/17, 03:03 - Janith: This is also different from peer pressure because the unlike in situations where people are drawn to do bad things by someone who has done it, the people in these situations are just acting on the situational forces that drive their behavior
04/07/17, 03:47 - Amin: I believe we can always choose
04/07/17, 03:49 - Amin: Seen it, loved it, Adrien Brody rocks 🤘
04/07/17, 04:01 - Janith: Welcome back 😂
04/07/17, 04:01 - Amin: Thanks 🙏😅
04/07/17, 04:05 - Imeldaroswara: No.. haven't. Let me google later.
04/07/17, 04:08 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: "Let me google later" - Classic INTP
04/07/17, 04:08 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: kinda weird to see someone using same word u always use
04/07/17, 04:32 - Janith: It's a movie based on the Stanford prison experiment
04/07/17, 04:32 - Janith: Though it seems to be sensationalized 😑
04/07/17, 05:38 - Maureen: of course it is
04/07/17, 05:39 - Maureen: aka "I'm so sorry I forgot"

One of my fav quotes:
In order to measure a person’s worth, you must do more than push them. The real way to test their worth is to give them power. When they gain the freedom to act outside the boundaries of law and ethics, you can sometimes see their souls. When the weak become strong... When good citizens become free to engage in violence... I'm interested to see what is the outcome of that.

04/07/17, 08:42 - Amin: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/2eoeo2/does_anyone_else_love_small_spaces/
04/07/17, 08:43 - Amin: Ok I love small places, can it be a intp thing too?
04/07/17, 08:44 - Amin: <Mídia omitida>
04/07/17, 08:44 - Amin: See this is me
04/07/17, 08:45 - Amin: <Mídia omitida>

04/07/17, 09:28 - Didier: I'm curious what the outcome will be too.Can you imagine?
04/07/17, 09:28 - Didier: Yep 😂
04/07/17, 09:28 - Imeldaroswara: Shivers....reading this..

I figured this might be an infp thing because I seem to just enjoy physical contact in general (snuggling, sitting next to people, can't sleep without a blanket touching me, sleeping in pajamas because I like the feeling of having clothes on, etc.)
04/07/17, 09:30 - Didier: Might just be an inxp thing,depends
04/07/17, 09:30 - Amin: I dont like physical contact, except for sex
04/07/17, 09:32 - Amin: <Mídia omitida>
04/07/17, 09:32 - Amin: And take a look at this it
04/07/17, 09:32 - Didier: I only like physical contact with peeps I'm close with
04/07/17, 09:32 - Didier: At least I know it kills my creativity 😂
04/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: Aka as when u have too many constraints
04/07/17, 09:33 - Amin: Over think the reasons for physical contacts?!
04/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: Aka*
04/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: What u mean haha
04/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: No,I'm just uncomfortable with peeps I'm not close with
04/07/17, 09:33 - Amin: Like, I dont know, being shy type of thing
04/07/17, 09:34 - Amin: No not my prob, I over think. And get shy
04/07/17, 09:34 - Didier: Reminds me,just curious,any INTP teacher here?

04/07/17, 09:35 - Maureen: I work in a school
04/07/17, 09:35 - Lulu: Maybe in the Future haven't decided
04/07/17, 09:35 - Imeldaroswara: Ah.. I watched that..long time ago...
04/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: What do u do exactly
04/07/17, 09:36 - Lulu: The idea of being a social worker has now been added to things I consider for my future lol
04/07/17, 09:36 - Lulu: Ugh
04/07/17, 09:36 - Amin: A Very awsome man he is
04/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: I prefer teaching a small group of students though
04/07/17, 09:36 - Maureen: I take care of the kids, I'm in class assisting the teacher, do stuff for teachers...
04/07/17, 09:36 - Lulu: So assistant teacher?
04/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: Just like Jesus and his disciples
04/07/17, 09:36 - Lulu: Lmak
04/07/17, 09:37 - Lulu: Lmao*
04/07/17, 09:37 - Maureen: basically, but just for 1 year
04/07/17, 09:37 - Didier: So u teach too sometimes?
04/07/17, 09:37 - Lulu: Is it to gain experience to be ur own teacher
04/07/17, 09:37 - Amin: I teach math some times
04/07/17, 09:37 - Lulu: Or for other things
04/07/17, 09:37 - Amin: To kids I like
04/07/17, 09:37 - Maureen: it's to kill some time 😂
04/07/17, 09:37 - Amin: But its nothing serious
04/07/17, 09:37 - Lulu: Oh 😭😭lol
04/07/17, 09:38 - Didier: Haha
04/07/17, 09:38 - Maureen: rarely
04/07/17, 09:38 - Imeldaroswara: Being social worker...will need lots of interaction with people. 😁
04/07/17, 09:38 - Amin: I always over explain stuff
04/07/17, 09:38 - Amin: Like putting too much effort
04/07/17, 09:38 - Maureen: for me it's different with kids
04/07/17, 09:38 - Lulu: Yeah but it's something I wouldn't mind
04/07/17, 09:38 - Amin: And the kids is like dude, I got it, Im not dumb
04/07/17, 09:38 - Amin: 😂😂😂
04/07/17, 09:38 - Lulu: Like I like helping people
04/07/17, 09:38 - Didier: Ikr,it's also in my list though,just not at the top
04/07/17, 09:39 - Lulu: Which is also why teaching and physical/massage therapy has been considered
04/07/17, 09:39 - Didier: Yeah it sounds really nice
04/07/17, 09:39 - Didier: I wonder how much they earn though?
04/07/17, 09:39 - Didier: Because I always hear people saying they earn little
04/07/17, 09:40 - Lulu: Teachers make the lowest liveable wage in this country so I kinda like push that one aside, maybe being a tutor or part time sub can fulfil that tho
04/07/17, 09:40 - Lulu: Hm
04/07/17, 09:40 - Amin: I did too in the past, not right now though
04/07/17, 09:40 - Lulu: Idk for my country

04/07/17, 09:41 - Didier: I'm also considering it because it sounds helpful for myself and others.I mean,massage therapy needs skill!
04/07/17, 09:41 - Maureen: Kindergarten teachers earn very low tho
04/07/17, 09:42 - Lulu: See I have been massaging my parents for a long time
04/07/17, 09:42 - Amin: Its a very good job
04/07/17, 09:42 - Didier: Wow,teachers earn quite a lot here
04/07/17, 09:42 - Amin: Its actually my life goal

04/07/17, 09:59 - Arne: You mean, he gets good grades, so he should do more for things he don't understand? Maybe nothing with school subjects to do, but getting better is the whole point?

04/07/17, 10:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol there are tons of people over the world who have ancient Persian names
04/07/17, 10:25 - Amin: Ok
04/07/17, 10:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: India has a mix of various people
04/07/17, 10:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And my face is so not Iranian!!!!!
04/07/17, 10:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Maybe your great great great great grandfathers or something were Iranian
04/07/17, 10:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: -_-

04/07/17, 10:27 - FABIO: hahahaha
04/07/17, 10:27 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It doesn't matter who they were. What matters is who I am.
04/07/17, 10:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Who they were determines who you are
04/07/17, 10:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am a homo sapien. And I am from earth.
04/07/17, 10:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: (As I was told)
04/07/17, 10:28 - FABIO: you can say all you want... but you does not go to far from what your parents are
04/07/17, 10:28 - FABIO: you always will be similar
04/07/17, 10:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I wish not
04/07/17, 10:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's what I'm saying
04/07/17, 10:28 - FABIO: i tryed so hard not to be like my father (who is an estp)... really really hard
04/07/17, 10:28 - Amin: Dude, it's Ok
04/07/17, 10:29 - FABIO: just to end being almost the same as hin
04/07/17, 10:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are not of flexible minds
04/07/17, 10:29 - FABIO: @919426153395 i was agreeing with you =D
04/07/17, 10:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I got that 😅😄
04/07/17, 10:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I could be a bit like them. But I am way too different from anyone else in my family
04/07/17, 10:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Alright let's get over this
04/07/17, 10:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're not getting it
04/07/17, 10:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I did
04/07/17, 10:32 - Aaron: I'm travelling with an isfj girl (gf of a very good friend) for a whole month now, in a car. I think I might actually get more insane than I already am
04/07/17, 10:33 - Aaron: Anyone got any tips on how to survive the coming two months?
04/07/17, 10:33 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My dad is ISFJ. So I guess I can underatand what you are dealing with
04/07/17, 10:34 - Aaron: Pls gief instruction manual
04/07/17, 10:34 - FABIO: how.. you travel with a gf of a friend
04/07/17, 10:34 - FABIO: thats not something to do.
04/07/17, 10:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😂
04/07/17, 10:34 - FABIO: hahahaha
04/07/17, 10:35 - Aaron: That friend is travelling with us.. In case you hadn't realised that..
04/07/17, 10:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😂😂
04/07/17, 10:35 - Didier: I agree
04/07/17, 10:35 - Didier: My moms is either an esfj/isfj
04/07/17, 10:36 - Didier: U r finally here Aaron!
04/07/17, 10:36 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My mom-ESFJ. My dad-ISFJ
04/07/17, 10:37 - Didier: And my sis is an ISFJ too,so crazy time
04/07/17, 10:37 - Aaron: How do you deal with them taking everything you say as a personal remark? And crying all the time and needing SOOOO much personal validation, all the time?
04/07/17, 10:37 - Didier: How is she like?What r yall doing?
04/07/17, 10:37 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I dealed with him as a son. Don't know how exactly to work if it is as a friend
04/07/17, 10:37 - Aaron: Hey Didier! Yeah, I've been crossing the outback and it's hard to get reception here
04/07/17, 10:38 - ‪+60 16-816 4493‬ saiu
04/07/17, 10:38 - Didier: Wow,mine are noisy but not crying all the time
04/07/17, 10:38 - Didier: Is it her personal problems?
04/07/17, 10:39 - Aaron: I think so.. Not really sure
04/07/17, 10:39 - Didier: Best way to deal with sensors is be straight to the point,do not talk with them but just have fun (physical whatever) with them
04/07/17, 10:40 - Didier: If she has a schedule,at least stick to it a bit
04/07/17, 10:40 - Aaron: She's not that good with genuine communication, everything sounds scripted sp it's hard to tell..
04/07/17, 10:41 - Aaron: Well, I don't really know how not to be straight to the point and that's the problem..
04/07/17, 10:41 - Didier: Do u have an example of how she takes things personally?
04/07/17, 10:42 - Didier: From how I deal with them,as long as they stay happy (u ensure this),u r fine
04/07/17, 10:43 - Didier: She must be an unhealthy ISFJ,sounds like a friend I used to have in the past
04/07/17, 10:44 - Aaron: Sure, we've got this big thermos to keep our coffee hot and one day it was full of dents and bumps so I made a jokingly remark about it half asking what had happened with it and she took it as a personal accusation of causing it.
04/07/17, 10:44 - Didier: Do not talk about her then,because she will take is as a personal remark and will need personal validation
04/07/17, 10:44 - Lulu: Lol
04/07/17, 10:45 - Didier: What...The thermos is for everyone?
04/07/17, 10:45 - Aaron: She needs the validation 24/7 and when I keep the conversation from getting personal she cries because she feels I don't want to really talk to her
04/07/17, 10:46 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I think the bigger question should now be that how does your friend tolerate her as a GIRLFRIEND ???
04/07/17, 10:46 - Lulu: Well talking about her is a personal remark and should be taken as such lol
04/07/17, 10:46 - Aaron: I don't get her, I wasn't made for this..
04/07/17, 10:46 - Lulu: She sounds a little bratty
04/07/17, 10:47 - Lulu: I mean not a little
04/07/17, 10:47 - Didier: 😂 Will need more details in order to help u
04/07/17, 10:47 - Lulu: But yeah
04/07/17, 10:47 - Didier: Yeah
04/07/17, 10:47 - Aaron: Yeah, but it's not like it's a bad thing. Who cares if she dropped itor her boyfriend.. Why would anyone take this as a personal affront?
04/07/17, 10:47 - Didier: OH YEAH
04/07/17, 10:47 - Didier: And r they even getting along
04/07/17, 10:48 - Aaron: Yeah, I'm abit scared to ask him that question..
04/07/17, 10:48 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: What is your friend's mbti ?
04/07/17, 10:48 - Aaron: I mean, she got angry at him for spilling just a tiny bit of beer on a fucking hostel dinner table..
04/07/17, 10:48 - Didier: Hahaha
04/07/17, 10:48 - Aaron: I think entp
04/07/17, 10:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Is she kind of hot ?
04/07/17, 10:49 - Aaron: Not to me
04/07/17, 10:49 - Aaron: At all
04/07/17, 10:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They will break up soon
04/07/17, 10:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They should
04/07/17, 10:50 - Aaron: But she thinks I am, and I just feel really awkward about that
04/07/17, 10:50 - Didier: No offence,but I think they will
04/07/17, 10:50 - Aaron: Meh, I'm not the one to make a judgement about that..
04/07/17, 10:50 - Didier: I get along with isfjs fine at first but in the end we fight
04/07/17, 10:50 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Exactly
04/07/17, 10:50 - Aaron: Yup
04/07/17, 10:51 - Didier: Wtf?Is there any justifiable reason behind that
04/07/17, 10:52 - Didier: This type of couple does not last long
04/07/17, 10:52 - Didier: Must find out what is wrong
04/07/17, 10:52 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They tend to be like what they think is what is right. Without even listening the sentence of the other person
04/07/17, 10:52 - Aaron: None whatsoever, but I am a highly logical being and I'm really blind when it gets to these weird sensing feeling kind of things..
04/07/17, 10:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: me too
04/07/17, 10:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: INTPs are that
04/07/17, 10:53 - Didier: One thing I admire about sensors is that they help me not overthink
04/07/17, 10:53 - Didier: I rlly appreciate this
04/07/17, 10:53 - Didier: Live in the moment,the fun
04/07/17, 10:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But some times I too get a bit emotional about things
04/07/17, 10:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Like what could happen for infp
04/07/17, 10:54 - Aaron: Weird thing is, she does overthink everything. But she's definitely a sensor
04/07/17, 10:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I had my best bonding with an INFP girl.
04/07/17, 10:55 - Aaron: Infp girls are the best imho
04/07/17, 10:55 - Didier: I think she might be an unhealthy isfj.Any reason why?
04/07/17, 10:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah. She was totally my type
04/07/17, 10:55 - Didier: Ooo.What happened there
04/07/17, 10:56 - Didier: Seems like intp and infp get along haha
04/07/17, 10:56 - Aaron: She's stuck in a childhood trauma of being judged, but she's judging others all the time herself
04/07/17, 10:56 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That was two years ago. And I am madly in love with her
04/07/17, 10:56 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Still
04/07/17, 10:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And always
04/07/17, 10:57 - Aaron: So I just told her what she was doing and oh boy, was that a bad idea..
04/07/17, 10:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
04/07/17, 10:57 - Didier: Tell her u r gonna be a friend,not a nasty foe
04/07/17, 10:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Throw her out of the car !!
04/07/17, 10:58 - Didier: 😂
04/07/17, 10:58 - Aaron: I did! Many times
04/07/17, 10:58 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ever tried this??!
04/07/17, 10:58 - Didier: HMM,she needs some mental tuning
04/07/17, 10:58 - Didier: I guess only ur friend can help now
04/07/17, 10:59 - Didier: It shouldn't be ur problem anyway
04/07/17, 10:59 - Didier: Ur friend should understand
04/07/17, 10:59 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: More than half of the global population needs it
04/07/17, 10:59 - Didier: Oh yeah right reminds me
04/07/17, 11:00 - Aaron: He has no clue on how to help her with this, I've a pretty clear view though but I just don't have the patience anymore..
04/07/17, 11:00 - Didier: I support ur unrequited love 😊.Did u try pursuing it?
04/07/17, 11:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I still am
04/07/17, 11:00 - Didier: I'm so glad 😪
04/07/17, 11:01 - Aaron: Oh boy.. Been pursuing for two years? Time to close that deal!
04/07/17, 11:01 - Didier: Exactly Faraz
04/07/17, 11:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I tried to. But just can't
04/07/17, 11:01 - Didier: What do u mean 😂
04/07/17, 11:01 - Aaron: Why not?
04/07/17, 11:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Don't know
04/07/17, 11:01 - Aaron: Yeah you do
04/07/17, 11:02 - Didier: One thing infps can't turn down is when they know someone loves them
04/07/17, 11:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm in kinda similar a situation but just tired of the fucking bullshit
04/07/17, 11:02 - Aaron: What does your gut/heart tell you?
04/07/17, 11:02 - Didier: If u let her know,I'm sure she is willing to try
04/07/17, 11:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: So about to smash it all into the freaking wall
04/07/17, 11:03 - Didier: With an infp?
04/07/17, 11:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah
04/07/17, 11:03 - Didier: Well,we can't turn down when people genuinely love us
04/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: Have you tried actually //pursuing her like what do you do
04/07/17, 11:03 - Didier: We will at least appreciate it
04/07/17, 11:04 - Didier: Ikr
04/07/17, 11:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: We were together for six months
04/07/17, 11:04 - Lulu: Ohh
04/07/17, 11:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ofcourse. The heart knows when the search is over
04/07/17, 11:05 - Didier: That's so vague haha
04/07/17, 11:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: She knows it. For two years
04/07/17, 11:05 - Didier: Then...?
04/07/17, 11:05 - Didier: Then?
04/07/17, 11:05 - Didier: Well we are shy beings too so forgive us
04/07/17, 11:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'd love to talk about that sometime later
04/07/17, 11:06 - Didier: We r the kind u must approach first
04/07/17, 11:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I really gotta go for now
04/07/17, 11:06 - Didier: Kk sure Jash
04/07/17, 11:06 - Lulu: Ttyl
04/07/17, 11:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lmao she was the one who approached me rather 😂
04/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I never confessed it directly because I always feared losing her as a friend
04/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: We rarely approach though we do 😂
04/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: But it takes a lot of courage
04/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: Maybe she knows u r not the kind to approach first too
04/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: She also was the first one to start flirting
04/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's what impressed me tbh 😂
04/07/17, 11:08 - Didier: THE MORE TO CONFESS
04/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: I've simply just had a lot of crushes in my day loll
04/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Why I'm saying in my day I don't know, I am only 17
04/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Lol
04/07/17, 11:08 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am more of a constant person.
04/07/17, 11:08 - Didier: It's fine,cuz if we take u as our friend,even if u confess,u'll still be our friend
04/07/17, 11:08 - Didier: Take it easy Faraz
04/07/17, 11:09 - Lulu: But like they are few and far in between
04/07/17, 11:09 - Didier: But not to the point u let it go
04/07/17, 11:09 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: You don't get it Didier. It's too late now
04/07/17, 11:09 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I wish had done it at the right moment
04/07/17, 11:09 - Didier: Who knows how late it is haha
04/07/17, 11:09 - Didier: She's not taken is she?
04/07/17, 11:10 - Lulu: As long as you are willing to make it work as a friend if she denies you then it will work, I mean if she is willing WA well
04/07/17, 11:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: On 7th August 2015
04/07/17, 11:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Maybe she found a better friend than me
04/07/17, 11:11 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Feel so like snape
04/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: Oh no,we have few friends.I believe u must be important to her if she still sees u
04/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: Idk man I'm real good at becoming emotionally detached when I don't see a future for it
04/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: WA?
04/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: So seeing this here is interesting although I understand it in a way
04/07/17, 11:11 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: We rarely talk
04/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: As*
04/07/17, 11:12 - Didier: Then u should talk more
04/07/17, 11:12 - Didier: Cuz infps and intps think too much 😂 u need to get out there if u want to make ur feelings across ok says me
04/07/17, 11:13 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It is more complicated than it seems. I will have to start it from day 1
04/07/17, 11:13 - Aaron: Alright guys, got to go! I've really no idea whatsoever on how to deal with this isfj issue but we'll see how it goes! Until next time I get some connection!! :)
04/07/17, 11:13 - Lulu: Then start from day 1
04/07/17, 11:13 - Lulu: Seeya*
04/07/17, 11:13 - Lulu: !*
04/07/17, 11:13 - Didier: Like I have old friends I wanna talk to,but I don't because I thought it might be weirs for them
04/07/17, 11:13 - Didier: weird
04/07/17, 11:14 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Hmm.... That could be her
04/07/17, 11:14 - Didier: Sure!Ttyl Aaron,and best of luck!!
04/07/17, 11:14 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah man. Ttyl. All the best tolerating her
04/07/17, 11:14 - Aaron: Thanks!
04/07/17, 11:14 - Didier: Haaha exactly
04/07/17, 11:15 - Didier: Don't worry,we like it when someone genuinely wants to talk to us
04/07/17, 11:15 - Didier: U can tell me more about it tho
04/07/17, 11:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Last time I saw her , she smiled at me for the first time in months and seemed eager to know my MBTI
04/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: THAT'S AN EVEN BETTER SIGN
04/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: Because,we only ask the mbti of people we care about
04/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: And we don't just smile at anyone
04/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: Maybe u make her smile
04/07/17, 11:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But that was just on a fine day
04/07/17, 11:17 - Lulu: #ISmileAtPrettyMuchEveryone
04/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: Hahaha
04/07/17, 11:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Just out of the blue
04/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: Anyone what I'm trying to say is,talk to her,she won't mind that
04/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: Approach her
04/07/17, 11:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Thankfully, I had smiled back
04/07/17, 11:17 - Lulu: Usually in eye contact or passing glances
04/07/17, 11:17 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
04/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: anyway*
04/07/17, 11:19 - Didier: If it looks like a genuine smile,that's one sign
04/07/17, 11:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I tried to suicide a few times when I get too frustrated. It didn't work out well. I felt like suiciding a few days ago
04/07/17, 11:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It didn't seem fake
04/07/17, 11:19 - Didier: Aw Faraz,y is that so?No worries ok!!
04/07/17, 11:20 - Didier: When it isn't fake,the upper muscles move
04/07/17, 11:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Didier, maybe you can understand her better . I will tell the entire story
04/07/17, 11:21 - Didier: I think you are a really lovely person
04/07/17, 11:21 - Didier: Someone who can become even better
04/07/17, 11:21 - Didier: Kk sure
04/07/17, 11:22 - Didier: I think u should just let it all out
04/07/17, 11:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Even if it would have been a fake smile, I don't think she would do that just for fun
04/07/17, 11:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Wait. Just a min
04/07/17, 11:26 - Janith: Check the corner of the eyes
04/07/17, 11:26 - Janith: There are some involuntary muscles there that contract only when someone smiles genuinely
04/07/17, 11:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I joined this school three years and three months ago
04/07/17, 11:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I used to live in another country earlier
04/07/17, 11:27 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I know that. I saw it from a distance while walking. So, didn't observe much. But I think there were some wrinkles around her eyes
04/07/17, 11:27 - Janith: Basically a duchenne smile
04/07/17, 11:28 - Janith: Then it was probably genuine
04/07/17, 11:28 - Janith: Who are we talking about?
04/07/17, 11:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: The girl I love
04/07/17, 11:29 - Janith: I just noticed you guys were talking about the authenticity of a smile and thought I'd offer my 2 cents 😂
04/07/17, 11:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My aunt was a very respe
04/07/17, 11:29 - Janith: Love is a strong word... Don't you think? 😅
04/07/17, 11:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Respected teacher of that school
04/07/17, 11:29 - Janith: Unless you know her intimately
04/07/17, 11:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I know
04/07/17, 11:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That's why I am using it
04/07/17, 11:30 - Janith: So what's the problem here?
04/07/17, 11:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Go read the previous messages
04/07/17, 11:30 - Didier: 😂

04/07/17, 11:31 - Didier: Here onwards
04/07/17, 11:32 - Janith: Can I guess instead? 
There's a girl. You really like her. Kinda afraid to make a move
04/07/17, 11:32 - Janith: @6582280971 am I close?
04/07/17, 11:32 - Didier: You can say so 😂
04/07/17, 11:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And she had helped me with my admission. Also made an extremely "good boy" reputation in from of the teachers , even before I came to india
04/07/17, 11:32 - Didier: But there's more to the story
04/07/17, 11:33 - Janith: Alright then.. Gimme a minute to check 😂
04/07/17, 11:33 - Didier: Nice auntie
04/07/17, 11:34 - Didier: He's actually saying it now 😂
04/07/17, 11:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I joined in 8th. And I had a micro-crush on a girl(not her), which ended up in a tragedy
04/07/17, 11:34 - Janith: Can understand that 😂
Just ended a similar thing two weeks ago
04/07/17, 11:35 - Didier: Y is that so
04/07/17, 11:35 - Didier: But anyway,I think that intp guys need to learn to make a move
04/07/17, 11:35 - Janith: We're like 2 months apart as far as questionable like decisions are concerned
04/07/17, 11:35 - Didier: Plus,infp girls usually don't make a move first haha
04/07/17, 11:36 - Janith: So current problem. What's stopping you @919554137104?
04/07/17, 11:37 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Many students came to know about my crush and framed it to her in I don't know what manner. So , she almost starting hating me
04/07/17, 11:38 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And I wasn't even that serious about that stupid girl
04/07/17, 11:38 - Janith: @919554137104, how old are you?
04/07/17, 11:38 - Didier: What the.Thank god it's not the biggest crush u have so far

04/07/17, 11:38 - Janith: Wow

04/07/17, 11:39 - Janith: No no. Most of the time I just use "wow" as a placeholder while I try to gather my thoughts
04/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: see
04/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: this is what i keep talking all the time here
04/07/17, 11:40 - Didier: Ok I get it 😂,but why is that super weird haha

04/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: and dont bother with it anymore
04/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: so you can focus on the things that really matter
04/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: SCIENCE
04/07/17, 11:40 - Janith: I'm actually surprised this time cause Faraz is basically mirroring what I did when I was 15 😂
04/07/17, 11:40 - Didier: 😂
04/07/17, 11:40 - Didier: Ask Fabio
04/07/17, 11:40 - Didier: U get life lessons from him

04/07/17, 11:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And when we talked during our free periods, it was as if, we were exactly like one another
04/07/17, 11:48 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: We could spend hours debating on almost nothing that made no sense to others listening

04/07/17, 15:18 - Janith: Amin. Bro. We can all be chill about this. I have no problem with that. But I must ask, How do you reconcile the contradictions?
04/07/17, 15:18 - FABIO: when they were building valhalla... there was a constructor and his magic horse.... so to gain a bet. loki had to distract the horse... he transformed hinself in a horse. and 9 months later gave to odin his 6 legs horse..
04/07/17, 15:18 - FABIO: do the math

04/07/17, 15:19 - Janith: Infalliable book with the word of god says earth is a frisbee
04/07/17, 15:19 - Janith: Earth is not a frisbee
04/07/17, 15:20 - Amin: No, my book never says that
04/07/17, 15:20 - Janith: Someone screwed something up
04/07/17, 15:20 - Janith: Flat, frisbee, pancake
04/07/17, 15:20 - FABIO: @989306939802  you reallly believe?
04/07/17, 15:20 - Janith: You know what I mean
04/07/17, 15:20 - FABIO: alla? or maome?
04/07/17, 15:20 - FABIO: i always mix those religions

04/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: What is maome

04/07/17, 15:21 - FABIO: ala?
04/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: Yeah
04/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: Allah
04/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: The one and only GOD
04/07/17, 15:21 - FABIO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad
04/07/17, 15:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Hm. I could do that
04/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: For me
04/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: And for muslims
04/07/17, 15:21 - Janith: From personal experience, People of the muslim faith tend to cognitively separate their religion and rationality
04/07/17, 15:21 - FABIO: sounds fun tho..
04/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Muslims are seriously rational
04/07/17, 15:22 - Janith: I'm actually kinda impressed at Amin for being an INTP who does that
04/07/17, 15:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah lol
04/07/17, 15:22 - Janith: Not when it comes to your beliefs
04/07/17, 15:22 - FABIO: im impressed he lets someone says to hin what to do.. or yet.. believe in an afterlife
04/07/17, 15:23 - FABIO: its both things.. i can not accept.. i will gadly die.. and probably saying that i will go to valhalla... but i do not belive in it.. if i just die and cease to exist..
04/07/17, 15:23 - FABIO: will be good for me
04/07/17, 15:23 - Amin: Actually there is a saying in my book, it goes like these, there is not even a little force in islam, any one who reads the book and says no to it can live his life as a none muslim
04/07/17, 15:23 - FABIO: but if there is actually an afterlife... i will bring hell to it
04/07/17, 15:24 - Janith: This!
My family is kinda religious too but I still put on my "Yeeeaaahh suuuurreee" face whenever they get religious
04/07/17, 15:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @989306939802 so what's that story about Muslims believing that non-Muslims are devil worshippers and thus should be killed?
04/07/17, 15:24 - Janith: There probably is...but there's also other areas in the book that say the opposite
04/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: For real?
04/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: Dude, God doesnt persist you to believe him, he doesnt give a fuck, he only tells you the truth
04/07/17, 15:25 - FABIO: or that homossexual is sin
04/07/17, 15:25 - FABIO: to me it is he giving a shit
04/07/17, 15:25 - Janith: Honestly I'm amazed at the fact that muslims tend to kill more muslims than non-muslims
04/07/17, 15:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah. There was this documentary i saw and a book I read. They described this
04/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: Pute lie dude, read the book
04/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: For muslims again
04/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: Not for non-muslims
04/07/17, 15:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Great man
04/07/17, 15:26 - FABIO: yeah
04/07/17, 15:26 - FABIO: the same
04/07/17, 15:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I suddenly respect you more
04/07/17, 15:26 - FABIO: i want to be muslim.. and want to give my ass
04/07/17, 15:26 - Didier: 😂
04/07/17, 15:26 - Didier: Oh god
04/07/17, 15:26 - Janith: There was a verse
04/07/17, 15:26 - FABIO: so i can not
04/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: Muslim are prohibited from killing, unless some one force em not to pray
04/07/17, 15:26 - FABIO: to me its telling mt i can not
04/07/17, 15:26 - Janith: Sura 2...something something
04/07/17, 15:26 - Janith: If I remember correctly
04/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: Its your choice dude, you can do whatever you want 😂😂
04/07/17, 15:27 - FABIO: hahahaha
04/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: Show it
04/07/17, 15:28 - Janith: Can't remember the exact verse. Like I said 2:...and something
04/07/17, 15:28 - FABIO: @989306939802 do you want to go to "heaven" and why?
04/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: There is no verse like that, the only time we are told to kill is the time that they didnt let us pray makka, and force us not to pray
04/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: I dont give a shit about heaven, I cant ignore signs dude
04/07/17, 15:29 - FABIO: LOL
04/07/17, 15:29 - FABIO: so you believe in all this
04/07/17, 15:29 - FABIO: yet do not care
04/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: Dude Ive been an atheist
04/07/17, 15:29 - Janith: Aaand..it's....okay to kill people just cause you can't pray?
04/07/17, 15:29 - Janith: I mean listen. I don't really give a shit about people myself
04/07/17, 15:30 - Janith: But that doens't sound like a very merciful god
04/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: No, there was a war, started by none muslims, they told us you cant have your own religion, and we said we wanna pray makka, u cant expel us from our own country
04/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: And in the war
04/07/17, 15:31 - Amin: God told us do not show mercy, its a war, no place for kindness
04/07/17, 15:31 - Janith: Selectively "merciful"
04/07/17, 15:31 - Amin: Its pretty simple dude
04/07/17, 15:31 - Janith: Wonder why the god didn't just...you know....stop the war
04/07/17, 15:32 - Janith: Omnipotence and all that
04/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: Dude, he doesnt play like a mad dog
04/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: He plays by reason
04/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: He gives us all opportunities
04/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: He gives us choice
04/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: To do whatever we want
04/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: This world is ours
04/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: We are free to do whatever we want
04/07/17, 15:33 - Janith: So it's not reasonable to stop a war because war bad?
04/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: As longs as we dont disrespect each others lives
04/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: No, its not reasonable not to stop people who dont respect others belief
04/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: Im telling you
04/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: Its all about freedom and choices
04/07/17, 15:34 - Janith: Soo...we shouldn't stop islamaphobia?
04/07/17, 15:35 - Janith: or any other religion based discrimination
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: We should stop terrorists
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: With all we got
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Read well what I said
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: I dont like repeating my self
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Told you
04/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Freedom till we dont disrespect eachothers rights
04/07/17, 15:36 - Janith: And then he went ahead and ignored when his own follower's rights were being ignored
04/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: Huh?
04/07/17, 15:36 - Janith: He could have just stopped the fighting
04/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: No he couldnt dude
04/07/17, 15:37 - FABIO: he kills.. so many unborn children
04/07/17, 15:37 - FABIO: kill the bad ones
04/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: He had no superpower
04/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: He had signs
04/07/17, 15:37 - FABIO: its easy.. just need a better managment
04/07/17, 15:37 - Janith: Omnipotence isn't a superpower?
04/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: It was his choice
04/07/17, 15:37 - FABIO: hahahaha
04/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: To believe them or ignore them
04/07/17, 15:38 - Amin: God never intervened during mohammad time
04/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: @989306939802 Take a step back. Take off the religion glasses and look at what you've been typing
04/07/17, 15:38 - Amin: Dude, its pretty rational
04/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: Do you have any evidence he interviened period?
04/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: Like at ANY time
04/07/17, 15:38 - Amin: Do you have any evidence that he did?
04/07/17, 15:39 - Amin: We cant depend on history dude
04/07/17, 15:39 - Amin: Told you
04/07/17, 15:39 - Janith: I don't have any evidence that he did
04/07/17, 15:39 - Janith: So I'm saying he didn't
04/07/17, 15:39 - Janith: Whose side are you on??
04/07/17, 15:39 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: If we can't depend on history you can't depend on the quran
04/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: Why are we arguing about this?
04/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: Simple as that
04/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: Will you ever change your mind?
04/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: Cause I want to know how you can manage to hold confilicting thought patterns in your head
04/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: It's a damn useful skill
04/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: I can
04/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 15:41 - Janith: Show me evidence and I'll convert faster than you can say "Holy shit dude you're a muslim"
04/07/17, 15:41 - Janith: Same question
04/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: Never
04/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: The only fixed thing in me is islam
04/07/17, 15:42 - Janith: And that my friend is the difference between rationality and indoctrination
04/07/17, 15:42 - Arne: True
04/07/17, 15:42 - Amin: Nevermind dude
04/07/17, 15:42 - Amin: Im telling you
04/07/17, 15:42 - Didier: Haha
04/07/17, 15:43 - Amin: We dont need to change each others belief

04/07/17, 16:39 - Arne: #nohomo
04/07/17, 16:39 - Janith: So is the tooth fairy

04/07/17, 16:40 - Janith: IT MOST CERTAINLY IS A HOX
04/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: Ah janith
04/07/17, 16:40 - Janith: It's the most elegant hox I've ever seen
04/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: U are so structured, for a thing like GOD
04/07/17, 16:41 - Janith: It's hoxness is unparralelled
04/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: We can talk structural
04/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: About anything
04/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: But about GOD
04/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: Im sry dude
04/07/17, 16:41 - Janith: So you're saying I got much shit together to the point where I can't belive in a god?
04/07/17, 16:41 - Juancho: Hahahahahahahahaha. You fools, believing in such as secular thing as evolution.
04/07/17, 16:41 - Janith: I agree
04/07/17, 16:41 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
04/07/17, 16:41 - Arne: Yes, but it's the first step.
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: Exactly
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: U R smart man
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: I like it about you
04/07/17, 16:42 - Janith: Conversely you're saying that you have to be unstable to believe in god :/
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: Smart enough
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: Uh exactly
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: Bravo
04/07/17, 16:42 - Amin: 👌👌👌
04/07/17, 16:43 - Juancho: Exactly what he's saying.
04/07/17, 16:43 - Janith: Again...whose side are you on man???
04/07/17, 16:43 - Amin: Dude you are getting it
04/07/17, 16:43 - Amin: I cant believe it
04/07/17, 16:43 - Amin: GOD
04/07/17, 16:43 - Arne: They also say that the poorest people of society has more percentage believing in God then rich people.
04/07/17, 16:43 - Juancho: I'm a bit disoriented here.
04/07/17, 16:43 - Amin: Janith, there are sides
04/07/17, 16:43 - Amin: We dont have a no side situation
04/07/17, 16:44 - Arne: There don't have to be sides
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: The point is
04/07/17, 16:44 - Arne: Putting things in boxes so you can give it a name
04/07/17, 16:44 - Arne: Not necessarily
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: Saiton is trying to have as much as he can on his side
04/07/17, 16:44 - Janith: Fun fact. Most terrorists are from upper class. Rich familes
04/07/17, 16:44 - Arne: is it
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: God gives you freedom
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: You should chase GOD
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: BUT SAITON CHASES YOU
04/07/17, 16:44 - Juancho: You gotta love that logic.
04/07/17, 16:44 - Amin: TO HAVE U ON HIS SIDE
04/07/17, 16:44 - Arne: Fun fact: they got the money to make this happen, poor people don't
04/07/17, 16:45 - Arne: 🤣
04/07/17, 16:45 - Amin: Exactly
04/07/17, 16:45 - Janith: So that's the reason
04/07/17, 16:45 - Janith: And @989306939802 ....Bullslhit
04/07/17, 16:45 - Amin: Its not dude
04/07/17, 16:45 - Amin: Its not
04/07/17, 16:45 - Janith: There's only one reason I don't tolerate beliefs
04/07/17, 16:46 - Amin: U should just stop being afraid
04/07/17, 16:46 - Amin: U love stability so much
04/07/17, 16:46 - Janith: It's because those belief systems promote ignorance and blind obedience so much
04/07/17, 16:46 - Janith: It gets in the way
04/07/17, 16:46 - Arne: We seek that stability in facts
04/07/17, 16:46 - Arne: True
04/07/17, 16:46 - Amin: Dude There is no sin that I havent done
04/07/17, 16:46 - Amin: Im serious about that shit
04/07/17, 16:46 - Janith: Actually...it is you who seeks stability
04/07/17, 16:47 - Amin: Except killing
04/07/17, 16:47 - Amin: No, Its you dude
04/07/17, 16:47 - Arne: Is murder a sin?
04/07/17, 16:47 - Janith: I realize the position I'm in as one being in one planet in the universe. Just how chaotic and fragile my existence is
04/07/17, 16:47 - Amin: U are all theory man
04/07/17, 16:47 - Janith: And I've made my peace with it
04/07/17, 16:48 - Amin: Its more fragile when u now u are born a servant
04/07/17, 16:48 - Amin: And we are all servants
04/07/17, 16:48 - Janith: Peace with not knowing what awaits after death. of what the eternal void will be like
04/07/17, 16:48 - Amin: Can you take it man?
04/07/17, 16:48 - Janith: Take what?
04/07/17, 16:49 - Janith: The only thing I've been a servant to was an obbsessive need to end my existence
04/07/17, 16:49 - Amin: That we are just litlle things, created by some one, for his goal
04/07/17, 16:49 - Juancho: This is why I stopped believing. They don't encourage thinking or skepticism but rather blind obedience and segregation.
04/07/17, 16:49 - Janith: Download space engine. Play it for a couple of hours
04/07/17, 16:49 - Amin: Because you wanna know what happens next
04/07/17, 16:50 - Janith: Just look at the scale of the fucking universe and tell me just how plausible you think your explanation is
04/07/17, 16:50 - Amin: Have you read quran ?
04/07/17, 16:50 - Arne: That is not how it works
04/07/17, 16:50 - Janith: No. I never cared
04/07/17, 16:50 - Amin: Irrelevant dude
04/07/17, 16:50 - Amin: U are running

04/07/17, 16:51 - Janith: It was nauseating
04/07/17, 16:51 - Amin: So if its right
04/07/17, 16:51 - Amin: Uve missed a lot
04/07/17, 16:51 - Amin: If not

04/07/17, 16:51 - Amin: Uve missed nothing
04/07/17, 16:51 - Amin: No big deal dude
04/07/17, 16:51 - Juancho: Hope so.

04/07/17, 16:52 - Amin: Dude I love sciense

04/07/17, 16:52 - Amin: And philosophy
04/07/17, 16:52 - Amin: I respect them
04/07/17, 16:52 - Amin: And they are serving humanity alot
04/07/17, 16:53 - Juancho: 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
04/07/17, 16:53 - Janith: The scientists, engineers and all the rest who brought us this far are like my brothers. I'd rather go to hell with them than stay in heaven without
04/07/17, 16:53 - Amin: I think thats why actually religion stopped
04/07/17, 16:53 - Amin: We should find out for ourselves
04/07/17, 16:53 - Amin: Force never works on humans
04/07/17, 16:53 - Janith: It works more than you think
04/07/17, 16:53 - Amin: They are all in heaven
04/07/17, 16:54 - Amin: Dude you are just mad
04/07/17, 16:54 - Janith: A lot are in hell
04/07/17, 16:54 - Amin: Every thing I say u refuse with no hesitate
04/07/17, 16:54 - Janith: The quran specifically states that

04/07/17, 16:54 - Amin: Hmmmm
04/07/17, 16:54 - Juancho: It damns all non believers to hell
04/07/17, 16:55 - Amin: Im not God to judge
04/07/17, 16:55 - Janith: Because I've done thing routine before
04/07/17, 16:55 - Amin: But Im telling you
04/07/17, 16:55 - Amin: Maybe u did it wrong dude
04/07/17, 16:55 - Arne: Good night folks

04/07/17, 16:56 - Amin: U know
04/07/17, 16:57 - Juancho: Starting to doubt @989306939802's sanity.
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: There is no one I know
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: Who believes in God
04/07/17, 16:57 - Janith: Stable but still unable to control your phsycial desires
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: Because most of em are rich dudes
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: And stop believing
04/07/17, 16:57 - ‪+98 937 775 2270‬: <Mídia omitida>
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: Others are intellects
04/07/17, 16:57 - Janith: Dude. Don't bother preaching to me if you're just gonna double cross your religion when it suits you
04/07/17, 16:57 - Amin: So no one asks me
04/07/17, 16:58 - Amin: Why don't u have muslim friends?
04/07/17, 16:58 - Janith: I have quite a few
04/07/17, 16:58 - Janith: I've done this same routine before
04/07/17, 16:58 - Janith: Each time. They get uncomfortable and try to change the subject
04/07/17, 16:58 - Amin: It doesn't make the religion wrong
04/07/17, 16:58 - Juancho: I have done so myself, all of my friends are christians
04/07/17, 16:58 - Amin: Dude be reasonable
04/07/17, 16:59 - Janith: Reason says it's wrong. Not taking you as an example
04/07/17, 16:59 - Amin: Janith, why don't you fuck hookers?
04/07/17, 16:59 - Janith: I do know an ESTP who's a model muslim
04/07/17, 16:59 - Janith: Moderate too
04/07/17, 17:00 - Janith: I have no interest
04/07/17, 17:00 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 17:00 - Janith: Plus I'm a demisexual
04/07/17, 17:00 - Juancho: What's that?
04/07/17, 17:00 - Amin: So u have same view as GOD
04/07/17, 17:00 - Janith: I don't feel sexually attracted to people I don't have an emotional connection with
04/07/17, 17:00 - Amin: yeah I googled it
04/07/17, 17:01 - Juancho: That's actually reasonable af.
04/07/17, 17:01 - Janith: I actually wouldn't do something so narcissistic as to force people to worship me
04/07/17, 17:01 - Janith: Why do you even consider fucking hookers Amin?
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: 😂😂😂
04/07/17, 17:02 - Janith: you're contributing to something god was against
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: U'll never know man
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: Hookers are pure emotions
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: They are very kind
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: And lovely people
04/07/17, 17:02 - Amin: U just prejudge them
04/07/17, 17:02 - Janith: Irrelevant
04/07/17, 17:02 - Janith: I don't judge them
04/07/17, 17:02 - Janith: I just don't know them
04/07/17, 17:03 - Amin: U asked me why I consider hookers
04/07/17, 17:03 - Juancho: @989306939802, you're all over the place.
04/07/17, 17:03 - Janith: Also setraline kinda kills your libido 😂
04/07/17, 17:03 - Amin: See
04/07/17, 17:03 - Juancho: Nearly all you're statements are paradoxical
04/07/17, 17:03 - Juancho: And moronic
04/07/17, 17:03 - Amin: True love is in hookers
04/07/17, 17:03 - Amin: Believe me
04/07/17, 17:03 - Janith: 🤦‍♂
04/07/17, 17:03 - Amin: Dude you are 15
04/07/17, 17:04 - Juancho: Right, says the god who has 20 wives a few of whom are little girls
04/07/17, 17:04 - Janith: Amin you wouldn't know true love if it came down from the sky and asked you to sacrifice your child to it
04/07/17, 17:04 - Amin: When I was 15 u deleted every one named GOD in front of me
04/07/17, 17:04 - Juancho: So. As you know that doesn't affect this debate at all
04/07/17, 17:04 - Juancho: We are talking facts and reason
04/07/17, 17:04 - Juancho: Non of which are on your side
04/07/17, 17:05 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
04/07/17, 17:05 - Amin: Dude, I find you on the corner
04/07/17, 17:05 - Amin: And Im not happy about it
04/07/17, 17:05 - Juancho: Hih?
04/07/17, 17:05 - Amin: Ok lets go the other way
04/07/17, 17:05 - Juancho: Huh?*
04/07/17, 17:06 - Janith: Corner of?

04/07/17, 17:06 - Amin: Im telling u about true love
04/07/17, 17:06 - Amin: U are running from my answer
04/07/17, 17:07 - Amin: Cause its just not similar to others
04/07/17, 17:07 - Amin: U find it funny
04/07/17, 17:07 - Amin: And make a joke about it
04/07/17, 17:07 - Amin: And Its reasonable what you do
04/07/17, 17:07 - Janith: Caring for another. A lot
04/07/17, 17:08 - Janith: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love
04/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: No
04/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: Love is personal attachment
04/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: U love some one
04/07/17, 17:08 - Amin: Because u are attached to her
04/07/17, 17:08 - Janith: Someone, something
04/07/17, 17:09 - Janith: More than one.
04/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: And u actually care about both of you
04/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: Mostly ur self
04/07/17, 17:09 - Janith: I separated that component. It gets in the way
04/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Let me tell you something
04/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: When a mother
04/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Loves her child
04/07/17, 17:10 - Amin: Will she die for the child?
04/07/17, 17:10 - Janith: I learned the meaning of love from my grandmother. She taught me that love should be something you give without expecting anything back
04/07/17, 17:10 - Janith: That's what I call love
04/07/17, 17:11 - Amin: Im talking freud dude
04/07/17, 17:11 - Janith: Trust on the other hand is a different story altogether
04/07/17, 17:11 - Amin: Ok any way
04/07/17, 17:11 - Janith: The dude that said I'd be rebellious if I had constipation as a child?
04/07/17, 17:11 - Amin: Answer that mother thing
04/07/17, 17:11 - Janith: Obviously
04/07/17, 17:11 - Janith: The child is the next generation
04/07/17, 17:11 - Janith: Genetic material
04/07/17, 17:12 - Amin: Ok
04/07/17, 17:12 - Amin: So another one
04/07/17, 17:12 - Amin: Does mother let the grown kid
04/07/17, 17:12 - Amin: Kill himself for her?
04/07/17, 17:12 - Janith: Kid an adult?
04/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: Yeah
04/07/17, 17:13 - Janith: She should
04/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: But she never will
04/07/17, 17:13 - Janith: As an adult the person gets to choose their fate
04/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: If she loves him
04/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: Dont get distracted
04/07/17, 17:13 - Amin: Stay focused
04/07/17, 17:13 - Janith: If it were my mother I'd expect her to respect my decision as a human being
04/07/17, 17:13 - Janith: But fine
04/07/17, 17:13 - Janith: Let's assume
04/07/17, 17:14 - Janith: She won't
04/07/17, 17:14 - Amin: Lets turn things around
04/07/17, 17:14 - Amin: Kid loves her mother as an adult
04/07/17, 17:14 - Amin: Will he prefers his death over mother's?
04/07/17, 17:15 - Janith: That is a very good question
04/07/17, 17:15 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 17:15 - Janith: One that I cannot answer without a highly immoral experiment
04/07/17, 17:15 - Amin: Love is actually different from what it looks
04/07/17, 17:15 - Amin: Its attachment
04/07/17, 17:15 - Amin: And attachment is selfish
04/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: We rather die over our beloved one
04/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: Because its easier
04/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: If it was selfless
04/07/17, 17:16 - Janith: No
04/07/17, 17:16 - Janith: You might
04/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: We would let our beloved one die
04/07/17, 17:16 - Janith: But never assume others would
04/07/17, 17:16 - Amin: And we would bare the grief
04/07/17, 17:17 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 17:17 - Janith: Assumptions undermine logical processes
04/07/17, 17:17 - Amin: Its obviuos
04/07/17, 17:17 - Janith: It's not
04/07/17, 17:17 - Janith: There are two confilicting forces
04/07/17, 17:17 - Amin: Just don't deny reality
04/07/17, 17:17 - Janith: Self-preservation and affection for the mother
04/07/17, 17:18 - Janith: It's not possible to figure out which will win the majority of times
04/07/17, 17:18 - Amin: Which would an uneducated human being choose
04/07/17, 17:18 - Janith: I could use the evolutionary argument in the case of the mother but here I can't
04/07/17, 17:18 - Amin: A normal human
04/07/17, 17:18 - Amin: Majority
04/07/17, 17:18 - Janith: This is independent of the educational background of the person
04/07/17, 17:19 - Janith: Sorry dude. But I will not claim to know something I cannot know
04/07/17, 17:19 - Amin: Ok then
04/07/17, 17:19 - Janith: Logical consistency is important to me
04/07/17, 17:20 - Amin: Things are different man
04/07/17, 17:20 - Amin: U get distracted so easy
04/07/17, 17:20 - Janith: If I cannot prove to you that what I say is true I will say it's speculation
04/07/17, 17:20 - Amin: By ur structures
04/07/17, 17:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I got an infantry axe

04/07/17, 17:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😅*
04/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂
04/07/17, 17:21 - Janith: I'm not the one talking about love when discussing God amin
04/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: Man
04/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: U said u only fuck when you love
04/07/17, 17:21 - Amin: I was telling you that
04/07/17, 17:22 - Amin: Hookers are full of love
04/07/17, 17:22 - Amin: Then u defined love wrong
04/07/17, 17:22 - Amin: Dude you forget stuff
04/07/17, 17:22 - Amin: And Im helping i about the thing that word is distracted by so much
04/07/17, 17:22 - Amin: Love ❤
04/07/17, 17:22 - Janith: I told you. I need an emotional connection
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: And u can emotionally connect to a hooker
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: Have u ever talked to one?
04/07/17, 17:23 - Janith: Dude they charge per hour 😂
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: They are pretty interesting
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: Uh, I forgot about money
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 17:23 - Amin: Ur right
04/07/17, 17:23 - Janith: I'm not emotionally open to people I've known for months
04/07/17, 17:23 - Janith: You do the math
04/07/17, 17:24 - Janith: You couldn't afford that
04/07/17, 17:24 - Amin: Hmmm
04/07/17, 17:24 - Amin: I get it
04/07/17, 17:24 - Amin: U cant solve ur emotions
04/07/17, 17:24 - Amin: But its allright
04/07/17, 17:25 - Janith: No. That's not it 😂
04/07/17, 17:25 - Amin: Then what is it?
04/07/17, 17:25 - Janith: I just won't stick my dick in a stranger
04/07/17, 17:25 - Amin: U said its about emotions
04/07/17, 17:25 - Amin: So its about knowing each other then
04/07/17, 17:26 - Janith: Yes
04/07/17, 17:26 - Amin: So knowing a person makes u feel safe
04/07/17, 17:26 - Amin: ?
04/07/17, 17:26 - Janith: No. Trusting a person makes me feel safe
04/07/17, 17:26 - Amin: Exactly
04/07/17, 17:26 - Janith: Whole different conversation
04/07/17, 17:26 - Amin: U are smart man
04/07/17, 17:26 - Amin: U really amaze me
04/07/17, 17:27 - Janith: All I did was separate love and trust 😅
04/07/17, 17:27 - Amin: Most cant
04/07/17, 17:27 - Janith: Their definitions didn't say they needed to work together 😅
04/07/17, 17:27 - Amin: And all I do is believe in signs
04/07/17, 17:27 - Amin: 😂😂
04/07/17, 17:27 - Janith: They complement each other true
04/07/17, 17:28 - Janith: But one can exist without the other top
04/07/17, 17:28 - Janith: *too
04/07/17, 17:28 - Amin: Exactly
04/07/17, 17:28 - Amin: No signs
04/07/17, 17:28 - Amin: No belief
04/07/17, 17:28 - Amin: So all Im saying is
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: Ive started getting signs
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: Because Ive done stuff
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: Reasonably
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: Then waited
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: And saw it worked
04/07/17, 17:29 - Amin: And I believed
04/07/17, 17:30 - Amin: So maybe if every one try asking for unreasonable signs
04/07/17, 17:30 - Amin: Then maybe
04/07/17, 17:30 - Amin: Reasoning is unreasonable
04/07/17, 17:30 - Janith: I need to know those signs. Can you pm them?
04/07/17, 17:31 - Amin: No way dude
04/07/17, 17:31 - Amin: You have your own God
04/07/17, 17:31 - Amin: But dont do it
04/07/17, 17:32 - Amin: U may go crazy
04/07/17, 17:32 - Amin: Seriously
04/07/17, 17:32 - Janith: I don't have a God man
04/07/17, 17:32 - Amin: Its cool
04/07/17, 17:32 - Janith: I crossed that threshold at 14
04/07/17, 17:32 - Amin: Some times telling stuff scares me
04/07/17, 17:32 - Janith: Tell me. You said you were an atheist once
04/07/17, 17:33 - Janith: Why'd you turn atheist the first time?
04/07/17, 17:33 - Juancho: I do recall that. I think he's flip floping.
04/07/17, 17:33 - Amin: Because I was horney
04/07/17, 17:33 - Amin: Then I went for reasoning
04/07/17, 17:33 - Juancho: Could you elaborate on that?
04/07/17, 17:33 - Amin: I chose to accept atheist
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: I chose to accept structures
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: But deep inside
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: I was horney
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: 😂😂😂
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: I love freud
04/07/17, 17:34 - Amin: He shows us that matter very well
04/07/17, 17:35 - Janith: You didn't become atheist then
04/07/17, 17:35 - Janith: You just crossed puberty
04/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: Dude
04/07/17, 17:35 - Amin: I believe me
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: I became an atheist
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: Im just telling u how it started
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: It goes like this
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: Why should I not care about my self
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: Why should I control my needs?
04/07/17, 17:36 - Amin: Why should I believe in that shit
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Oh look at this, its philosophy
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Thalees observes
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Lets be observant
04/07/17, 17:37 - Janith: Because time is limited.
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Dude we structure the  world
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Define it
04/07/17, 17:37 - Amin: Then expand our def
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: And we see it doesn't work
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: Then we correct it
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: But it aint work
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: Untill we remember something
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: Maybe
04/07/17, 17:38 - Amin: A defenition of structure
04/07/17, 17:39 - Amin: Cant be expanded
04/07/17, 17:39 - Amin: Because details are too much to neglect
04/07/17, 17:40 - Janith: I don't see where you're going with this
04/07/17, 17:46 - Amin: Dude u forget ur questions
04/07/17, 17:47 - Janith: Right sorry
04/07/17, 17:47 - Janith: I just don't see how your search for structure is gonna lead anywhere
04/07/17, 17:48 - Amin: Text me in private message
04/07/17, 17:48 - Janith: Sure
04/07/17, 17:59 - Amin saiu
04/07/17, 19:16 - Tel entrou usando o link de convite deste grupo
04/07/17, 19:16 - Tel: Oo
04/07/17, 19:16 - Tel: Good display pic
04/07/17, 20:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Hey
04/07/17, 22:14 - Juancho: Anyone looking to play chess
04/07/17, 22:17 - Juancho: Add me
04/07/17, 22:17 - Juancho: JJL314
04/07/17, 22:17 - Juancho: In chess.com
05/07/17, 00:11 - Arne: I knew he would leave... Why did you bring it so far people?
05/07/17, 00:26 - Imeldaroswara: What happened? Who left?
05/07/17, 00:27 - Juancho: We were simply debating religion
05/07/17, 00:28 - Imeldaroswara: Whoooo.... that's a pretty sensitive topic....🤔
05/07/17, 00:28 - Imeldaroswara: For some people...
05/07/17, 00:30 - Juancho: I don't care
05/07/17, 00:31 - Juancho: Religion is not something i'm particularly fond of
05/07/17, 00:33 - Juancho: @94754191589 were simply pointing out the logical fallacies and inconsistencies of his religion
05/07/17, 00:34 - Juancho: You guys as INTPs should know better than to criticize us. As INTPs we debate to reach the most logical conclusion and we don't take arguments down to the intimate or personal level
05/07/17, 00:34 - Imeldaroswara: It used to be a pretty sensitive topic for me. I am Christian.
But then..along the year...I thought that since I am a fallible human, it's not my responsibility to defend what I believe. Isn't that why God give freedom to human...to do either good or bad... So why should I limit other people... Who am I... We are all human.

Since then... I am more relaxed when someone wants to criticize or debate about Christianity. We are all responsible for our choices after all.
05/07/17, 00:34 - Imeldaroswara: I agree....
05/07/17, 00:37 - Imeldaroswara: I can honestly said that some days... My INTP-ness makes me doubt God's existence... Hahaha...

But I learn that it's part of my struggle in life.
05/07/17, 01:17 - Janith: Don't worry guys. He'll come back
05/07/17, 01:17 - Janith: Yesterday's conversation was a little too much for his introversion he said
05/07/17, 01:20 - Juancho: I'm aware of his claim
05/07/17, 01:20 - Juancho: I simply don't fall for it
05/07/17, 01:25 - Janith: So, any Asgardians here?
05/07/17, 01:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yes!!!!!!!!
05/07/17, 01:46 - Imeldaroswara: http://personalitygrowth.com/how-dirty-the-mind-of-each-personality-type-actually-is/

INTP
INTPs are extremely open-minded people, who enjoy exploring new ideas and possibilities. They have extremely vivid imaginations, and a rich inner world. This can cause the INTP to explore some very dirty thoughts, and might even entertain the idea of trying new things in their sex life. INTPs however, are rarely expressive about this side of themselves, and very rarely will they make an outwardly dirty joke. They will show this side of themselves to someone they trust very deeply, and this will likely be a romantic partner. An INTP might hold in their dirty jokes, but less one loose at the perfect moment- just for the effect and reaction that it will cause. They enjoy testing the waters and pushing people’s buttons, but they also enjoy silently observing.

Oopsiee...☺
05/07/17, 01:55 - Janith: Pretty accurate I think
05/07/17, 01:55 - Janith: Especially the bit about rarely expressing it
05/07/17, 01:56 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah....that imagination is... 
If only other MBTI types know.... They would have chased us...
We will be the idols... LOL..
05/07/17, 01:58 - Janith: True 😂
INTPs are the freakiest of the 16
05/07/17, 01:58 - Janith: I'm guessing it's the inferior Fe that keeps that particular side of our personalities dormant for the most part
05/07/17, 01:59 - Maureen: No "It's a choice" - "no, it's not" argument anymore??
05/07/17, 01:59 - Maureen: also a few days ago he wanted me to believe in god
05/07/17, 02:00 - Janith: An INTP who has worked on their Fe should be really good with the opposite sex 😂
05/07/17, 02:00 - Janith: Haha don't worry Maureen. He'll be back again 😂
05/07/17, 02:00 - Janith: He just leaves periodically to get his alone time
05/07/17, 02:01 - Maureen: I need some arguments without him🙈
05/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: 😂
05/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: He's definitely an interesting character though
05/07/17, 02:02 - Maureen: he's exhausting
05/07/17, 02:02 - Janith: Not often you meet an INTP capable of sustaining conflicting information within themselves
05/07/17, 02:02 - Janith: He's kinda misogynistic for some reason. Though he's working on it
05/07/17, 02:03 - Maureen: like "I'm an atheist - but you *must* believe in God
05/07/17, 02:03 - Maureen: "
05/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: He was like that with me in the brief period he thought I was a girl
05/07/17, 02:03 - Maureen: sexist
05/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: Right. Sorry. Got the words mixed up 😅
05/07/17, 02:03 - Imeldaroswara: And how can we do refine our Fe....
This is one of my struggles in life...a.k.a relationships..
05/07/17, 02:04 - Maureen: he thought I was a guy and when I said I was gay he talked to me about anal sex and aids
05/07/17, 02:04 - Imeldaroswara: Logical fallacy...😅
05/07/17, 02:04 - Janith: Tbh I have no idea. I just decided that it's better to stick with dating NTs. They get your use of logic better
05/07/17, 02:04 - Maureen: it turns out he's bisexual
05/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: Also they tend to be kinkier so that's a plus 😂
05/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: Now that I did not know
05/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: If I had to guess though. I think it would require relinquishing some aspects of your life to your Fe
05/07/17, 02:06 - Arne: If he is not into this debate, why stay attacking him on his believes. When you try debate someone religious, that the change is sooo small that they will let the religion go.
05/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Instead of letting Ti do all the heavy lifting
05/07/17, 02:07 - Maureen: we did the same tho when he said he raped someone...
05/07/17, 02:07 - Maureen: my guess is he almost left that day
05/07/17, 02:07 - Janith: We're not attacking him. Just questioning him. The dude knew that I was only looking to get to the logical root of it
05/07/17, 02:08 - Arne: Yes, but he stands in for his believe, so for him, you are attacking him too, probably
05/07/17, 02:08 - Janith: @4915127175996 I don't think he's that kinda guy. 
He'll stand his ground but just like the rest of us he can only take so much social interaction per day
05/07/17, 02:09 - Janith: As an INTP I expect him to make the distinction between him and his beliefs. I told him that a few times too
05/07/17, 02:10 - Janith: We don't progress by avoiding controversial topics
05/07/17, 02:10 - Arne: Doesn't mean he will. It's still a part of him self, what makes him. He can try to don't get offended and stuff, but yeab
05/07/17, 02:10 - Arne: We don't progress to talk about religion who everyone knows it isn't true, why stand still, and people will get offended.
05/07/17, 02:11 - Janith: I know but this group is mainly somewhere where we can discuss, criticize and exchange ideas
05/07/17, 02:11 - Janith: There's the problem. People don't accept that it isn't true
05/07/17, 02:11 - Arne: Criticize for more then an hour about the same topic, with no results, except him leaving,
05/07/17, 02:12 - Janith: I told you why he left
05/07/17, 02:12 - Janith: And timing has nothing to do with it
05/07/17, 02:12 - Arne: That is the shitty part, he won't believe it. So why spend time to get him there?
05/07/17, 02:12 - Janith: I'm always open to arguments. He made some interesting ones
05/07/17, 02:12 - Arne: Oh it does.
05/07/17, 02:13 - Imeldaroswara: Hehehe.... 
Can we all agree to disagree....?
05/07/17, 02:13 - Janith: Because I assumed he'd have a well thought out reason for his belief
05/07/17, 02:13 - Janith: Awww... But we're supposed to be confrontational 😂
05/07/17, 02:14 - Arne: Okay, I just wanted to have this said. Thanks for listening.
05/07/17, 02:14 - Janith: Don't worry @arne. This is just like last time
05/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: He told me himself
05/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: We discussed it further in private too
05/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: In the end he notified me that he left because he needed to be alone for a bit again
05/07/17, 02:16 - Janith: Which is understandable for me. There's quite a temptation to check the messages in this group 😂
05/07/17, 02:16 - Arne: And yesterday it was quite bussy
05/07/17, 02:18 - Janith: Leads me to wonder if the group really is more active when he's around
05/07/17, 02:18 - Imeldaroswara: From culturally speaking, sometimes it's harder to debate with asian people than, say like europe or us people.

Not that I am racists or anything.

Asian sometimes still get affected by the thought "if you are not agree with me, you are not in my group, that means you are my enemy."

Compare to people from europe / usa, which is a bit more independent in thinking and actions.
05/07/17, 02:19 - Janith: Really? I never thought of it like that
05/07/17, 02:19 - Janith: Though... Considering that Asian culture is collectivist I guess that would make sense
05/07/17, 02:20 - Janith: I guess the groupthink aspect works much better in collectivist cultures than individualistic ones
05/07/17, 02:21 - Janith: Though according to what amin said he's the black sheep in his group. Most of his friends aren't religious
05/07/17, 02:46 - FABIO: Lol
05/07/17, 02:49 - FABIO: Annyone up?

05/07/17, 02:54 - Arne: Because they need it
05/07/17, 02:54 - FABIO: All my friends have this problem.. their girl wants to watch something
05/07/17, 02:54 - FABIO: Then fall sleep
05/07/17, 02:54 - FABIO: Always
05/07/17, 02:54 - Arne: 🤣🤣
05/07/17, 02:55 - Janith: Fairly common problem it would seem 😂

05/07/17, 03:05 - Janith: Anyone have any idea why some people are sorta obsessed with psychopaths and serial killers?
05/07/17, 03:06 - FABIO: Great question
05/07/17, 03:06 - Janith: #relationshipgoals
05/07/17, 03:06 - FABIO: I dont like those people too
05/07/17, 03:06 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Because iz ma life
05/07/17, 03:06 - Janith: My ex was. I can't figure out why
05/07/17, 03:07 - Janith: I ended up thinking that it was because I could generally understand the mindset of a serial killer. So I didn't find them fascinating anymore
05/07/17, 03:07 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I'm obsessed cause I really wanna be a Forensic Psychologist and wanna know how they think and what do they do
05/07/17, 03:07 - Juancho: I see you're keeping over 50 tabs open; all of which are random science shit like a good INTP would.
05/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Yes. Hahahahaha
05/07/17, 03:08 - Janith: You see this to be is a logical obsession. Hers wasn't like that
05/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Did you figured that its my wall
05/07/17, 03:08 - Janith: She thought Ted Bundy was romantic as fuck
05/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Not my screen
05/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: ?
05/07/17, 03:09 - Juancho: That's why any INTP should consider anything upward of 16gb of RAM
05/07/17, 03:09 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Fuck me... but he looks cool af for a serial killer
05/07/17, 03:09 - FABIO: I have 16
05/07/17, 03:09 - FABIO: Hahahahahahaha
05/07/17, 03:09 - Janith: I'm sure you can imagine the awkward silence that ensued when I told her that he performed necrophilia on decomposing victims 😂
05/07/17, 03:09 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Lol you really write a lot
05/07/17, 03:10 - Janith: 16 too 😁
05/07/17, 03:10 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: He was obsessed of necrophilia yes
05/07/17, 03:11 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
05/07/17, 03:11 - FABIO: 😂😂
05/07/17, 03:11 - Janith: One of the things I don't quite get. 
Probably because I'm not really into people without a pulse
05/07/17, 03:12 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Most serial killers don't have feelings for what they're doing
05/07/17, 03:12 - Arne: Yeah
05/07/17, 03:12 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: They're obsessed
05/07/17, 03:12 - FABIO: I dont bite that
05/07/17, 03:12 - Janith: @201093844198 why do you think some people are fascinated with necrophilia? It doesn't seem like there would be a logical reason
05/07/17, 03:13 - Janith: I doubt that. They do it cause they like it
05/07/17, 03:13 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I mean towards people
05/07/17, 03:13 - Janith: They wouldn't do it if they didn't.
05/07/17, 03:13 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: They don't regret it
05/07/17, 03:13 - FABIO: I think they are just assholes... who care only for thenselfs.. but do actually.have feelings
05/07/17, 03:13 - Janith: No I understand that. I have sociopathic tendencies myself
05/07/17, 03:14 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
05/07/17, 03:14 - Janith: I just don't get the allure of necrophilia for anyone
05/07/17, 03:14 - Janith: 😂
05/07/17, 03:14 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: 😂
05/07/17, 03:15 - FABIO: 😂😂
05/07/17, 03:15 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: They're sociopaths
05/07/17, 03:15 - Janith: Because in all honesty I don't see the point in doing anything to a dead body. It serves no purpose
05/07/17, 03:15 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I have to research more on this
05/07/17, 03:15 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Stressors maybe... idk
05/07/17, 03:15 - FABIO: I think in then as a broken machinne
05/07/17, 03:15 - Janith: Maybe it's just a fault in their brains
05/07/17, 03:15 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Stressors from their past
05/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
05/07/17, 03:16 - Janith: Exactly. The same code that should run for a live person runs here too
05/07/17, 03:16 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: https://youtu.be/U-tm3bDAoDE 
Ok she's not a serial killer but she killed her kids and that smile at the end is seriously terrifying
05/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: Take this as example
05/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: The robot shouldnt be doing that
05/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: Its a error. A failure... they are just broken software
05/07/17, 03:16 - Janith: It's killing the dance floor that's for sure
05/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: And for some reason.. they cant upgrade
05/07/17, 03:17 - FABIO: 😂😂 tottaly
05/07/17, 03:17 - Janith: And I agree. I think that's the exact reason
05/07/17, 03:17 - Janith: Considering the complexity of the human brain its not hard to think that something went screwy for a small amount of people
05/07/17, 03:17 - FABIO: 👆🏻
05/07/17, 03:18 - FABIO: Like turret syndrom
05/07/17, 03:18 - FABIO: They tottally look like something circuited there
05/07/17, 03:18 - FABIO: 😂😂
05/07/17, 03:19 - Janith: tourettes syndrome dude 
You had me imagining people with machine gun turrets coming out their backs 😂
05/07/17, 03:19 - FABIO: Lol sorry
05/07/17, 03:19 - FABIO: That one
05/07/17, 03:19 - Janith: Turret syndrome sounds much cooler though
05/07/17, 03:19 - FABIO: Im on smartphone.. cant google
05/07/17, 03:20 - Janith: No worries
05/07/17, 03:21 - Janith: Though I did have that discussion with another NT and she said that it could be because most people crave the freedom from social pressures they perceive serial killers to have
05/07/17, 03:21 - FABIO: Hmmm
05/07/17, 03:21 - FABIO: Could be
05/07/17, 03:21 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: Stressors... true
05/07/17, 03:21 - Janith: That or an evolutionary hiccup makes them seem hyper-masculine
05/07/17, 03:21 - FABIO: But just be free
05/07/17, 03:22 - Janith: Would explain why most people attracted to serial killers are women
05/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: Its not like you cant stop giving a shit
05/07/17, 03:22 - ‪+20 109 384 4198‬: I believe it's something psychologically and biologically
05/07/17, 03:22 - Janith: In psychopathy there's a biological component
05/07/17, 03:22 - Janith: Sociopathy is more behavioral
05/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: Have you guys watched slipt?

05/07/17, 03:38 - FABIO: its gods mistake...
05/07/17, 03:38 - Janith: Err...
05/07/17, 03:38 - FABIO: should never leaved the drawnings that went wrong

05/07/17, 03:40 - FABIO: the last joke? the final joke
05/07/17, 03:40 - FABIO: the one that joker dies

05/07/17, 15:22 - Lulu: I was only gone for less than a day, but a substantial amount of hours still

06/07/17, 02:40 - Janith: Hey new guy. Might want to hang around a bit. The group's a little dead at the moment
06/07/17, 02:44 - Maureen: don't lie, I got 2000 messages yesterday...
06/07/17, 03:49 - Lulu: Totally would sell homemade ones for cash if there was a market for it lmaoo
06/07/17, 03:52 - Imeldaroswara: That's not the thing I want to sell. I want to sell how to do perfect murder, I have quite references. 

1 plan for 1 person ~ USD 100 million. 
Please pay in bitcoin.

Hahaha... ☺
06/07/17, 03:53 - Janith: That was before amin left again 😂
06/07/17, 03:54 - Janith: There a correlation between the two it would seem
06/07/17, 03:54 - Janith: Homemade what?
06/07/17, 03:54 - Imeldaroswara: Homemade bombs..
06/07/17, 03:55 - Janith: You'd be at a disadvantage though
06/07/17, 03:55 - Imeldaroswara: Why?
06/07/17, 03:55 - Imeldaroswara: It's not me doing the killing.
06/07/17, 03:55 - Janith: Supply and demand rules put the price for a professional hit much lower
06/07/17, 03:55 - Imeldaroswara: I am simply the facilitator.
06/07/17, 03:55 - Lulu: Buy, murder seller, steal money back
06/07/17, 03:55 - Janith: Why not just make them at home?
06/07/17, 03:56 - Imeldaroswara: But there is a certain satisfaction in "getting the job's done"
06/07/17, 03:56 - Janith: If you could murder the seller then you could probably murder the target without much trouble too
06/07/17, 03:56 - Imeldaroswara: Thus..not using professional hitman
06/07/17, 03:56 - Lulu: Imagine you sell the guide on how to commit a perfect murder to someone who wants to kill you lol
06/07/17, 03:57 - Janith: Wouldn't it be cheaper to use a professional hitman?
06/07/17, 03:57 - Janith: The end goal is achieved
06/07/17, 03:57 - Janith: At a fraction of the cost even
06/07/17, 03:57 - Lulu: Probably not cheaper but overall less traceable and easier
06/07/17, 03:57 - Lulu: Idk
06/07/17, 03:58 - Janith: The moment you sell a guide it becomes less than perfect though
06/07/17, 03:58 - Lulu: Depends who and what you get idk price ranges for this lol
06/07/17, 03:58 - Janith: Cheaper. They don't charge 100 million per hit
06/07/17, 03:58 - Janith: We should search the deep web
06/07/17, 03:59 - Lulu: I'm too paranoid to even have a deep web browser on my laptop
06/07/17, 03:59 - Lulu: Lmao
06/07/17, 03:59 - Imeldaroswara: This is where the benefits of INTP coming...

I saw one meme about INTP making appointments with some other MBTI types. But then there is a hitman target all of them. In the end, INTP is getting very late to the agreed place, on the way there, INTP changes his mind, going grocery instead. Hahaha.. so funny.
06/07/17, 03:59 - Janith: The thing is, if the price was that high then local criminals would easily be able to undercut any big agencies
06/07/17, 03:59 - Arne: They can hack the file
06/07/17, 04:00 - Imeldaroswara: This is one of advantages. The other thing is as I mentiones. The satisfaction of seeing your target dying....no one can put price on that.
06/07/17, 04:00 - Janith: Even if they don't, the perfect plan is something the target won't know at all.
06/07/17, 04:00 - Lulu: I mean if you sell it, the guide is predictable and you'd be sure to avoid things
06/07/17, 04:01 - Janith: But if you use cryptocurrency to pay for the hit then it's untraceable regardless
06/07/17, 04:01 - Imeldaroswara: There is a saying:
If you want quality goods, you need to pay more.

High price, high quality stuff.
06/07/17, 04:01 - Janith: The added protection would be negligible
06/07/17, 04:01 - Lulu: I say I'm too paranoid but I'm really just too fucking lazy to go through the steps to get a deep web browser
06/07/17, 04:01 - Lulu: Lmao
06/07/17, 04:02 - Janith: True. Depends on the type of hit though
06/07/17, 04:02 - Lulu: In other words, you get what Ya pay for lol
06/07/17, 04:02 - Janith: If you want to kill the husband at a wedding cause you want the bride to yourself then you need real professionals
06/07/17, 04:03 - Janith: Making the annoying coworker dissappear doesn't need to be that precise.
06/07/17, 04:03 - Janith: I might look into it
06/07/17, 04:04 - Lulu: Political statement assassination v.S casual assassination
06/07/17, 04:04 - Imeldaroswara: I want to look what is in deepweb, but I am too scared with gory websites/content. Hahaha
06/07/17, 04:04 - Janith: You're scared of gore?
06/07/17, 04:05 - Janith: Political statements are dangerous
06/07/17, 04:05 - Imeldaroswara: Bloody stuff... dismembered bodies..😖
06/07/17, 04:05 - Lulu: It all depends on what state of mind I'm in tbh
06/07/17, 04:05 - Janith: Pretty easy to trace back
06/07/17, 04:06 - Janith: I like that stuff sometimes. I once saw a video of a guy who had his face split down the middle after face planting on concrete
06/07/17, 04:06 - Lulu: Sometimes when I dwell on it bloody stuff makes me feel calm in a way, thinking of it at least
06/07/17, 04:06 - Lulu: Thinking of ah dangerous thoughts lmao
06/07/17, 04:06 - Janith: Me too! 
Strangely calming it is 😂
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: But yeah bloods nice sometimes
06/07/17, 04:07 - Imeldaroswara: That's why I don't become a doctor.... I can't stand the sight of bloody body...
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: Really! Like I feel like a freal
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: Whenever I get a cut I try to squeeze as much blood out as I can
06/07/17, 04:07 - Janith: You see if we weren't so Damn lazy us INTPs would be dangerous 😂
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: And watch it poor
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: Loll trie
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: True*
06/07/17, 04:07 - Imeldaroswara: You're crazy...
06/07/17, 04:07 - Lulu: Pour*
06/07/17, 04:08 - Imeldaroswara: I feel shivers down my spine..when I cut my fingers...
06/07/17, 04:08 - Lulu: It's even better if I'm in the bath, watch it mix with the water
06/07/17, 04:08 - Janith: I don't do that but it's more because I know I'll have to work to replace the nutrients lost
06/07/17, 04:08 - Lulu: Even better if there are bubbles
06/07/17, 04:08 - Janith: Running water forces it to bleed more though
06/07/17, 04:08 - Lulu: Ever seen blood drip on bubbles
06/07/17, 04:08 - Lulu: Wonderful
06/07/17, 04:09 - Janith: It doesn't go through?
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: It does but it makes it red
06/07/17, 04:09 - Janith: Blood should be much thicker. So heavier
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: I'm not talking about pouring blood cuts lol
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: See the same way it thins with water
06/07/17, 04:09 - Janith: Oh 😂
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: It thins out among the bubbles
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: Spreads out
06/07/17, 04:09 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah... I saw once
06/07/17, 04:09 - Lulu: Like drip drop blood cuts lol
06/07/17, 04:10 - Janith: So basically blood bubbles 🙆‍♂
06/07/17, 04:10 - Lulu: :3
06/07/17, 04:10 - Janith: I haven't seen anything like that
06/07/17, 04:10 - Janith: Though maybe I have and just wasn't paying attention 😂
06/07/17, 04:11 - Janith: So @6590236374, we make you concerned yet? 😂
06/07/17, 04:12 - Janith: Oh and is it weird that I don't like scenes in movies where they draw blood?
06/07/17, 04:12 - Lulu: I pay a little much attention lol
06/07/17, 04:12 - Janith: Real blood is okay. Movie blood just seems wrong
06/07/17, 04:13 - Lulu: When I get blood drawn I giggle
06/07/17, 04:13 - Lulu: True
06/07/17, 04:13 - Janith: Not wrong as in morally. Just that it seems... Sickly. Like it's they used something a donor clinic would throw out
06/07/17, 04:14 - Lulu: Really is I agree tbh
06/07/17, 04:14 - Janith: @14843534493 I would love to see you dating a vampire 😂😂
06/07/17, 04:14 - Lulu: I'm really not one for horror movie blood
06/07/17, 04:14 - Imeldaroswara: A bit...
06/07/17, 04:14 - Lulu: Damn i wanna be the vampirw
06/07/17, 04:15 - Janith: Oh God that shit is horrible. So fake it makes you cringe
06/07/17, 04:15 - Lulu: Let me suck the sweet blood out of a cute boys neck please
06/07/17, 04:15 - Imeldaroswara: But I believe..everyone is allowed to have their dope... Hahaha...
06/07/17, 04:15 - Janith: So glad I don't fall under that category 😂
06/07/17, 04:15 - Lulu: I'm very okay with anime blood tho?
06/07/17, 04:15 - Janith: What's yours? 😃
06/07/17, 04:16 - Janith: Remember that scene in attack on Titan with Erin's mothers blood in place of Sakura blossoms in normal anime? 😂
06/07/17, 04:17 - Imeldaroswara: Me....thinking about perfect crime... 
Korean drama
Songs... I have 32 GB of musics...still craving more..
Youtube...especially religion debates... ☺
06/07/17, 04:17 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 04:17 - Janith: Though I must admit that I was more interested in how much bite force the Titan would need to have to cause a shower of blood like that
06/07/17, 04:17 - Janith: There was a considerable distance after all
06/07/17, 04:18 - Lulu: Horror animal and insane amounts of blood are nice
06/07/17, 04:18 - Janith: Ah... The perfect crime.
06/07/17, 04:18 - Janith: Guys we should meet up sometime and do it
06/07/17, 04:19 - Janith: Lulu can handle the distraction
06/07/17, 04:19 - Janith: Just go on a killing spree somewhere 😂
06/07/17, 04:19 - Lulu: Only if I'm getting paid or they did something bad :3
06/07/17, 04:19 - Lulu: Loll
06/07/17, 04:19 - Janith: Also... That's an impressive library of songs
06/07/17, 04:20 - Janith: And @6590236374 you missed the awesome debate me and amin had 😂
06/07/17, 04:20 - Janith: Oh hey out of curiosity, what are both of your religious affiliations?
06/07/17, 04:20 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah.. I know... And I regret it so much...
06/07/17, 04:21 - Lulu: Agnostic I guess, although I don't really care for anything
06/07/17, 04:21 - Imeldaroswara: I am Christian...cannot say fully devoted though...
06/07/17, 04:21 - Janith: Fine I'll do it 😂
My moral compass is loose enough to just go on a random killing spree anyway
06/07/17, 04:22 - Lulu: I don't personally follow anything but I respect the admiration and faith some people hold sometimes
06/07/17, 04:22 - Lulu: Unless it's harmful
06/07/17, 04:22 - Lulu: Then fuck them lol
06/07/17, 04:22 - Imeldaroswara: I'll prepare the plans,  tools, and the escape vehicles..
06/07/17, 04:22 - Janith: Agnostic is technically the stance most atheists (me included) have. We just find the term atheist to be a better category
06/07/17, 04:22 - Janith: Ooohh so we can still have debates on religion :D
06/07/17, 04:23 - Janith: Just to clarify though, you don't believe in creation or flat Earth right?
06/07/17, 04:23 - Imeldaroswara: Bring it on... Hahaha....
But I still in office.. 😅
06/07/17, 04:23 - Imeldaroswara: Flat earth - nope
06/07/17, 04:23 - Imeldaroswara: Creation - yes
06/07/17, 04:24 - Lulu: It's 3:23 am here lol
06/07/17, 04:24 - Janith: Can I get in on the planning too? I really like planning. Execution.... Well you guys can do that 😂
06/07/17, 04:24 - Imeldaroswara: Truly..INTP.. hahaha
06/07/17, 04:25 - Imeldaroswara: The big question though..
Who is the target?
06/07/17, 04:25 - Janith: So you don't believe in evolution? Or just believe that created first then evolved?
06/07/17, 04:25 - Imeldaroswara: The intricateness of the plan will depend on who the target is.
06/07/17, 04:26 - Imeldaroswara: Created first, then God made it evolved...in order to be in His image.
06/07/17, 04:26 - Janith: Yesterday (well... Today technically) was the only day I purposefully stayed up till past 3
06/07/17, 04:26 - Lulu: I haven't since last week, or two weeks ago?
06/07/17, 04:26 - Janith: Most of the other days it's the group. So interesting you guys are 😂
06/07/17, 04:27 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 04:27 - Imeldaroswara: Music helps me a lot...to prevent my mind from wondering around.
06/07/17, 04:27 - Lulu: I haven't been active during my day time lately cuz I'm looking after three little munchkins more
06/07/17, 04:27 - Janith: Just the belief lacking solid evidence for an alternative theory for life being seeded on earth I'm guessing?
06/07/17, 04:28 - Lulu: My aunt and uncle are staying here until their new place is ready due to a bit of confusion
06/07/17, 04:28 - Janith: Same here. What kind of music do you prefer?
06/07/17, 04:28 - Janith: Oh cool. So you have 3 little minions 😂
06/07/17, 04:28 - Lulu: I listen to pretty much everything
06/07/17, 04:29 - Imeldaroswara: Music for playing games...
Two steps from hell..
Ever heard of it?
06/07/17, 04:29 - Lulu: They cleaned my room the other day! I told them not to because they really shouldn't but hey they do a good job lmao
06/07/17, 04:29 - Janith: I Googled two steps from hell recently. Was planning on checking it out 😂
06/07/17, 04:29 - Janith: Got distracted though 😅
06/07/17, 04:30 - Janith: Damn... I should get my cousins to come over
06/07/17, 04:30 - Janith: I can't stand pop music most of the time 😅
06/07/17, 04:31 - Janith: And generally music that seems hollow (I don't know how to describe it but the lyrics don't seem to carry weight)
06/07/17, 04:31 - Janith: I'm mostly listening to game soundtracks these days.
06/07/17, 04:31 - Imeldaroswara: Not really...
I still haven't reached my final conclusion....still gathering all the data... I might change my mind later on and totally believe in evolutions.. 
But that is what I believe"for now".
06/07/17, 04:31 - Lulu: Idk a lot of pop had been getting a little better I think, some at least
06/07/17, 04:32 - Lulu: Although today the obsession with techno beats that drown out the voices kinda irk me lol
06/07/17, 04:32 - Janith: What do you think about the theory based on the Miller-Urey experiment?
06/07/17, 04:32 - Imeldaroswara: Korean pop, japanese pop, western pop, indian pop...
Any kind...as long as the beat/melody is nice. Hahaha... That's the lowest of my music requirement...
06/07/17, 04:33 - Janith: I can't remember the exact name for it. Just the currently accepted one
06/07/17, 04:33 - Imeldaroswara: Ah...the joy of INTP....
Multiple topic threads at the same time.
Now I can die in peace.
06/07/17, 04:33 - Janith: Yeah that shit is annoying
06/07/17, 04:33 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:34 - Imeldaroswara: So....your side job is a witch?
06/07/17, 04:34 - Janith: A good beat is hard to turn down I admit
06/07/17, 04:34 - Lulu: It kinda pisses me off when a song that I know is suppose to have words takes more than 30 seconds to have words
06/07/17, 04:34 - Janith: KITTY!!!
06/07/17, 04:34 - Lulu: Lol aw
06/07/17, 04:35 - Janith: I don't mind waiting but I hate it when songs have very few words
06/07/17, 04:35 - Imeldaroswara: Haven't heard of it...
Let me google later.
I swear...cross my heart and hope to die.
06/07/17, 04:35 - Imeldaroswara: +1
06/07/17, 04:35 - Janith: Some have barely a verse that's just repeating over and over for 5 minutes 😂
06/07/17, 04:35 - Janith: Whoa whoa. No need to commit that much. You're an INTP and I don't want you to die yet
06/07/17, 04:36 - Lulu: I'm okay with that if the song is only a little over 3 mins
06/07/17, 04:36 - Lulu: Which they rarely are of that kind lol
06/07/17, 04:36 - Janith: Yeah it's like they think they're getting paid by the minute 😅
06/07/17, 04:37 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:37 - Lulu: She sleeps next to me
06/07/17, 04:37 - Lulu: I do agree with the masses tho Beyonce is kind of a queen
06/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: There was a demon that looked like your cat in the game I was just playing
06/07/17, 04:38 - Lulu: Christina Aguilera #1 tho
06/07/17, 04:38 - Lulu: Lol cute
06/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: White eyes though
06/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: My thoughts exactly 😂
06/07/17, 04:38 - Lulu: My baby is a little fuzz ball
06/07/17, 04:38 - Janith: Hey @6590236374 when do you get off work?
06/07/17, 04:39 - Janith: What's their name?
06/07/17, 04:39 - Lulu: That is nina
06/07/17, 04:39 - Lulu: I have another, he is older and his name is munchie
06/07/17, 04:40 - Janith: Nina was one of the ships Columbus came one 😂
06/07/17, 04:40 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:40 - Lulu: This is munchie
06/07/17, 04:40 - Janith: Two colored eyes? That cat looks so cool
06/07/17, 04:41 - Janith: You are a witch aren't you @14843534493?
06/07/17, 04:41 - Janith: Curious. Would modern witches ride modern brooms?
06/07/17, 04:41 - Janith: Questions to keep one up at night
06/07/17, 04:41 - Imeldaroswara: Some Korean pop songs is truly stupid but the beat is addicting.

06/07/17, 04:42 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:42 - Imeldaroswara: In 1.5 hours...😓
06/07/17, 04:43 - Imeldaroswara: I thought by munchies... You mean nieces/nephews... Hahaha...
06/07/17, 04:43 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 04:43 - Aaron: What's all this about bullying some guy 'till he left? Because of religion?
06/07/17, 04:43 - Lulu: ?
06/07/17, 04:43 - Janith: I'll see you after work then. Though make it 2 1/2 hours cause I have something to do too
06/07/17, 04:44 - Aaron: Go up 700 messages ;)
06/07/17, 04:44 - Janith: That is Arne overreacting
06/07/17, 04:44 - Aaron: Was it Arne that left?
06/07/17, 04:44 - Janith: Amin left for a bit again but he said it was because he wanted to be alone for some time
06/07/17, 04:44 - Janith: No no. Amin
06/07/17, 04:45 - Imeldaroswara: Oopps... The teacher is coming.
I feel like getting reprimanded.... Hahaha
06/07/17, 04:45 - Lulu: So he has left twice now then?
06/07/17, 04:45 - Janith: No worries. I'll take the blame 😂
06/07/17, 04:45 - Janith: Yeah. Last time also because he wanted to avoid socializing
06/07/17, 04:45 - Lulu: I haven't really been reading and catching up what was
06/07/17, 04:45 - Lulu: Ah ok
06/07/17, 04:45 - Janith: He informed me both times
06/07/17, 04:46 - Aaron: Haha, I'm anything but a teacher, dear. He'll be back if he wants to, and we all know he won't be able to resist the temptation. Someone should tell him he can just mute the chat though ^^
06/07/17, 04:47 - Lulu: Anyone wanna see my face, I'd abstain but I feel like sharing my face for whatever reason, I'm probably just a little bored
06/07/17, 04:47 - Janith: This thing is too tempting 😂
06/07/17, 04:47 - Aaron: Go for it
06/07/17, 04:47 - Janith: I do 🙋‍♂
06/07/17, 04:47 - Lulu: And ID usually show my face in a group chat by this point but there were so many people here lol
06/07/17, 04:47 - Janith: I'm thinking catwoman
06/07/17, 04:48 - Lulu: Fair warning gonna send a selfie that I painted on a fake unibrow
06/07/17, 04:48 - Aaron: Tempting how? :p
06/07/17, 04:48 - Janith: Fake unibrows are the best
06/07/17, 04:48 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:48 - Lulu: Honestly doesn't look much like me
06/07/17, 04:48 - Lulu: I mean it does
06/07/17, 04:48 - Lulu: But not lol
06/07/17, 04:48 - Janith: We discuss so much topics here. It's glorious to be able to have serious debates and do so in a very casual manner too
06/07/17, 04:49 - Janith: I like your fake unibrow 😊
06/07/17, 04:49 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:49 - Lulu: Thank you!
06/07/17, 04:50 - Lulu: This was me at a failed attempt with liquid eyeliner
06/07/17, 04:50 - Janith: Dayumn. Did you get into a fight 😂
06/07/17, 04:50 - Lulu: Oh how it burnt
06/07/17, 04:50 - Lulu: LOL
06/07/17, 04:50 - Janith: What is eyeliner actually?
06/07/17, 04:50 - Lulu: Just
06/07/17, 04:50 - Lulu: Eyeliner
06/07/17, 04:50 - Aaron: Much prefer that eyeliner than the snapchat filter!
06/07/17, 04:51 - Janith: And how is it being a liquid a good idea 😅
06/07/17, 04:51 - Lulu: Lol!
06/07/17, 04:51 - Lulu: Who knows
06/07/17, 04:51 - Lulu: I don't even wear makeup I just experiment at times lol
06/07/17, 04:51 - Janith: Agreed. The filter is definitely irritating but I'm trying to be nice today 😂
06/07/17, 04:52 - Janith: Experimentation is always a good thing
06/07/17, 04:52 - Lulu: Cuz the one with eyeliner is my actual face, just messy xD
06/07/17, 04:52 - Janith: Remind me I said that when we meet during a zombie apocalypse
06/07/17, 04:52 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 04:53 - Janith: In all honesty, you look cuter in the eyeliner pic 😂
06/07/17, 04:53 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:54 - Janith: Okay I take that last thing back. This is your best picture so far
06/07/17, 04:54 - Lulu: Lol!
06/07/17, 04:54 - Janith: It is! I love crazy hair 😂
06/07/17, 04:54 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:54 - Janith: I can practically see you bumping into walls 😂
06/07/17, 04:54 - Lulu: Personal fav with hair
06/07/17, 04:55 - Lulu: I don't wear My hair like that thankfully lol
06/07/17, 04:55 - Janith: That's quite impressive actually. Lovely display of entropy
06/07/17, 04:56 - Janith: If it could remain in that position while standing I'd try to make that a trend
06/07/17, 04:56 - Lulu: It can
06/07/17, 04:56 - Lulu: It did
06/07/17, 04:56 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 04:56 - Janith: Gravity defying hair 😂
06/07/17, 04:56 - Lulu: The top half was just a giant messy bun tbh
06/07/17, 04:56 - Lulu: 😭😭
06/07/17, 04:57 - Janith: Points for originality then
06/07/17, 04:57 - Imeldaroswara: I think it must be INTP thing... To not be proficient with makeup...
06/07/17, 04:57 - Lulu: I have not shown one normal picture so far tho 😭😭😂😂😂
06/07/17, 04:57 - Janith: Normal is overrated.
06/07/17, 04:58 - Janith: I'm thinking this is true. We seem to be unable to process appearances that well
06/07/17, 04:59 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 04:59 - Lulu: This is the best I can do makeup
06/07/17, 04:59 - Lulu: Eyeliner on the waterline and lips lol
06/07/17, 04:59 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:00 - Lulu: LOL
06/07/17, 05:00 - Janith: That's pretty good actually
06/07/17, 05:00 - Janith: Though I prefer you without the makeup
06/07/17, 05:00 - Lulu: I can and could do it, but fuck that it's uncomfortable and takes time
06/07/17, 05:00 - Lulu: So do I ❤
06/07/17, 05:00 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 05:00 - Janith: Crazy bun would be ideal 😂
06/07/17, 05:01 - Janith: Makeup is uncomfortable?
06/07/17, 05:01 - Lulu: Idk if its just lips I'm fine
06/07/17, 05:01 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:01 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Hii guys
06/07/17, 05:01 - Lulu: But if I need to rub my eyes
06/07/17, 05:01 - Lulu: I'm gonna rub my eyes
06/07/17, 05:01 - Lulu: Hheyyy
06/07/17, 05:02 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: How U doing 😂😂
06/07/17, 05:02 - Janith: Why I'll never host a party
06/07/17, 05:02 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Hhhhhh
06/07/17, 05:02 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:02 - Lulu: Getting a little closer to a "normal" pic lol
06/07/17, 05:02 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I do have party's but i get bored quiqly
06/07/17, 05:02 - Janith: Oh yeah... Since makeup is so widely used I assumed it wasn't that uncomfortable
06/07/17, 05:03 - Lulu: Idk I see that as a hassle
06/07/17, 05:03 - Lulu: But so many girls are use to it, it's like a second skin to them
06/07/17, 05:03 - Janith: Isn't that a normal pic?
06/07/17, 05:03 - Lulu: Kinda lol
06/07/17, 05:03 - Janith: 😂 somehow that conjured up images of snakes shedding their skin
06/07/17, 05:04 - Janith: That's why I stopped with most parties a while back. I know I'll get bored do I just don't
06/07/17, 05:04 - Janith: It seems more logical
06/07/17, 05:04 - Janith: Hey @14843534493 shouldn't you be sleeping?
06/07/17, 05:05 - Lulu: Wanna see me memeing myself
06/07/17, 05:05 - Lulu: Nahhhhh
06/07/17, 05:05 - Janith: Doubt it's wise to stay up this long
06/07/17, 05:05 - Janith: Yaaasss
06/07/17, 05:05 - Janith: I will never turn down a meme
06/07/17, 05:05 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:05 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:06 - Lulu: How passive aggressively triggered do I look
06/07/17, 05:06 - Lulu: Omg
06/07/17, 05:06 - Lulu: Same
06/07/17, 05:06 - Janith: When someone says women have no right abort? 😂
06/07/17, 05:06 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:06 - Janith: Naaahh. Your nose isn't TMNT material 😂
06/07/17, 05:07 - Lulu: Me in a snapchat filter with my nose dripping
06/07/17, 05:07 - Lulu: LOL
06/07/17, 05:07 - Janith: What's the filter?
06/07/17, 05:08 - Janith: I don't see the filter 😅😅😅
06/07/17, 05:08 - Lulu: It was an older L'Oreal promotional filter
06/07/17, 05:08 - Lulu: It's the makeup
06/07/17, 05:08 - Lulu: It was really cute
06/07/17, 05:08 - Lulu: And I was taking a cute selfie with it but my nose dripped
06/07/17, 05:09 - Janith: So that's the "real" in the picture 😂
06/07/17, 05:09 - Janith: I thought that was something on your shirt
06/07/17, 05:09 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:09 - Lulu: Lol yeah no 😂😂😂
06/07/17, 05:10 - Lulu: I prefer potatoes.com

06/07/17, 05:15 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:16 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:16 - Janith: Though personally I'd think of her as graphene. Way cooler than diamonds
06/07/17, 05:16 - Lulu: Last one I promise
06/07/17, 05:17 - Janith: The filterrr!! 
It buuurrrnnnss
06/07/17, 05:17 - Janith: Other than that you look nice though ☺
06/07/17, 05:17 - Lulu: Loll! If I burn you with filters all the potatoes will be mine!
06/07/17, 05:17 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:18 - Janith: Ah but you forget. I have a shield
06/07/17, 05:18 - Lulu: Let's go man
06/07/17, 05:18 - Lulu: Nooo! Made of what!
06/07/17, 05:18 - Janith: Made of not being on snapchat or Instagram 😂
06/07/17, 05:18 - Lulu: 😂😂
06/07/17, 05:19 - Janith: And video games with much better graphics 😅
That's the real reason the filters make me cringe
06/07/17, 05:19 - Janith: They could do so much better
06/07/17, 05:19 - Janith: The gpus on phones should be able to handle it
06/07/17, 05:20 - Lulu: I always forget that I have a bad time not sending too many pictures until I start sending pictures
06/07/17, 05:20 - Lulu: Well you couldn't tell that that one was a filter lol
06/07/17, 05:20 - Lulu: Lol
06/07/17, 05:20 - Janith: Oh I just thought it was an abomination that's all 😂
06/07/17, 05:21 - Lulu: I meant this one lmao
06/07/17, 05:21 - Janith: Does it add a squidward nose?
06/07/17, 05:21 - Janith: It looks like a squidward nose
06/07/17, 05:21 - Lulu: Lol!
06/07/17, 05:21 - Janith: In my defense it was dark okay?
06/07/17, 05:22 - Lulu: 🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀😂
06/07/17, 05:22 - Janith: No really. It looks like a squidward nose. But in more or less your skin tone
06/07/17, 05:22 - Janith: (okay much less... But you know)
06/07/17, 05:23 - Janith: You have beautiful eyes though
06/07/17, 05:23 - Janith: Not as great as squidward's but close enough
06/07/17, 05:23 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:24 - Lulu: Thank ya
06/07/17, 05:24 - Janith: I used to fear this so much 😂
06/07/17, 05:24 - Lulu: Squidward has those dreamy eyes
06/07/17, 05:24 - Janith: Now I just revel in the fact that I have no friends so there's no problem if my battery dies 😂
06/07/17, 05:25 - Lulu: I have a mother who likes to know where I am
06/07/17, 05:25 - Lulu: So I have much to worry lol
06/07/17, 05:26 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:27 - Janith: Okay that's gonna be my new dp
06/07/17, 05:28 - Janith: Dammit. Too small :(
06/07/17, 05:34 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
06/07/17, 05:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Don't lie to me, we aren't that blatant. We just act nice while screaming 'Fuck off!' inside ourselves
06/07/17, 06:31 - Janith: Aaand there goes my childhood
06/07/17, 06:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Nah
06/07/17, 06:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Your childhood dies after you find out that neverland is the afterlife and that the children never age, because they died. And then your childhood rolls around in it's grave when you realize that peter pan is an angel of death
06/07/17, 06:49 - Janith: Or when you realize that all the rugrats except Angelica don't exist and are only in the head of Angelica who is schizophrenic
06/07/17, 06:57 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Didn't watch rugrats...
06/07/17, 06:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Lulu indirectly put me in an embarrasing situation
06/07/17, 06:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Whatsapp automatically saves images
06/07/17, 06:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And a friend was browsing my memes when he came across the fuckton of selfies she sent to the group
06/07/17, 06:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And, in front of my family, asked: 'You have a gf?'
06/07/17, 07:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My mother then proceeded to interrogate me as to why I didn't tell her about my new 'gf'
06/07/17, 07:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Where can I change the setting?
06/07/17, 07:12 - Imeldaroswara: It's not an embarrassing situation..to have a gf as pretty as Lulu..
06/07/17, 07:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not that
06/07/17, 07:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My mother grilling me in front of my family was embarrasing
06/07/17, 07:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'I knew you weren't gay!'
06/07/17, 07:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Why didn'rlt you tel me!?'

06/07/17, 10:06 - Lulu: It's because I have a really good body clock and I'm good at estimating times like that
06/07/17, 10:07 - Lulu: Unless I'm being mentally lazy, if I'm in a car I can estimate the time it'll most likely take to get somewhere, give someone a time and show up exactly then most of the time
06/07/17, 10:08 - Janith: Mine just says whether it's day or sleep
06/07/17, 10:08 - Janith: I tend to be early most of the time cause I always add a buffer to my estimates

Is it just me or is the plot basically summarized by 'bunch of paranoid women jumping to conclusions'
06/07/17, 14:34 - Janith: At least the plot at the end of the first season
06/07/17, 14:34 - Maureen: the following seasons go more into the science
06/07/17, 14:34 - Maureen: it's wild tho 😂
06/07/17, 14:35 - Janith: Ah okay. 😅
06/07/17, 14:35 - Janith: But it's kinda funny considering they could have just solved their problems in season one itself 😂
06/07/17, 14:35 - Maureen: no 😂
06/07/17, 14:35 - Maureen: let's go private 😂
06/07/17, 14:36 - Janith: All they had to do was sign the contracts with a whistleblower

06/07/17, 16:25 - Maureen: that's when the doctors professional discretion kicks in
06/07/17, 16:50 - Lulu: 18, I can make most of my own appointments but I can't check in without a guardian
06/07/17, 16:50 - Maureen: we can do that by 14
06/07/17, 16:50 - Lulu: I fuckin wish man
06/07/17, 16:52 - Maureen: my parents don't know shit about my history with my doctors for ages

07/07/17, 00:45 - Imeldaroswara: If the scheme is that customers must pay based on how many hours they spent together, 
The answer could be Yes, as long as... 
The first 5-10 minutes are considered as 1st hour.

07/07/17, 00:58 - Imeldaroswara: I think even nowadays..."robots" already ruled over humans... Seeing how we enslave ourselves to our computers and/or gadgets...
07/07/17, 01:12 - FABIO: Yeah

07/07/17, 01:23 - Imeldaroswara: Can it calculate the shortest route..? I remember in one international robbotic contest.. the winner was a robot who could calculate the shortest route using phytagoras theorem..
Don't know whether this is true or not..

Seriously though why does stuff like this even need mentioning??
07/07/17, 04:15 - Imeldaroswara: Uhmmm....because we're heading for the doom mountain
07/07/17, 04:17 - Imeldaroswara: All INTP must unite and "going out of our hermit cave", starts infiltrating medias and etc....

This is important for our species continuity!!!
07/07/17, 04:24 - Janith: Can't we stay in our hermit caves and just mobilize the ENTPs and ENTJs instead?
07/07/17, 04:24 - Janith: I like my hermit cave
07/07/17, 04:31 - Imeldaroswara: There are 4 options available:
1. Rudimentary format of your clone
2. Hologram reflection of yourself
3. Learn to perform astral projection...
07/07/17, 04:32 - Imeldaroswara: Last but not least..
07/07/17, 04:32 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
07/07/17, 05:33 - Janith: #4 definitely
07/07/17, 07:31 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: What do you think about astral projection ? Is it real or just some sort of dreams ... ?
07/07/17, 07:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Idk
07/07/17, 07:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Probably just dreams
07/07/17, 07:33 - Imeldaroswara: Probably possible
07/07/17, 07:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We have no way to prove/disprove it
07/07/17, 07:34 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Does any of you ever tried it ?
07/07/17, 07:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Nah
07/07/17, 07:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You have to meditate and shit
07/07/17, 07:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My mind always drifts when I try to concentrate
07/07/17, 07:35 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I Had an expérience
07/07/17, 07:35 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: It felt real
07/07/17, 07:37 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I was able to fly and feel stuff with my hand. Going through walls
07/07/17, 07:37 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: ...
07/07/17, 07:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Sounds like lucid dreamimg
07/07/17, 07:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Could you read anything?
07/07/17, 07:37 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Astral projection
07/07/17, 07:38 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Cs i was in my room
07/07/17, 07:38 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: And my room mate was sleeping
07/07/17, 07:38 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I was watching him sleeping 😂
07/07/17, 07:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Could you read anything?
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: No idk
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because you can't read in dreams
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You can in astral projection apparently
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: There was nothing to read in my room
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂😂
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Is there usualy something to read?
07/07/17, 07:39 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: My books i guess
07/07/17, 07:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Actually, I'm goimg to stop my self before I try to completely disprove your experience
07/07/17, 07:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If it felt real and you enjoyed it then I'll believe it
07/07/17, 07:41 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: See the thing is that i used to belive that it was real
07/07/17, 07:41 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I used to belive in spirituality
07/07/17, 07:41 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: But those things are not explained
07/07/17, 07:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I try to believe in something if I have no reason not to
07/07/17, 07:42 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: They are felt
07/07/17, 07:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's easier
07/07/17, 07:43 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I trust logic and my mind
07/07/17, 07:43 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I dont trust my feelings
07/07/17, 07:44 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
07/07/17, 07:45 - Arne: Good one, today is the first day after my grand mother died, that I kinda cried.
07/07/17, 07:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I think you should trust your feelings
07/07/17, 07:45 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: James randy offered 1 million dollars to anyone who is able to prove spirituality exists
07/07/17, 07:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not completely though
07/07/17, 07:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Just don't disregard them
07/07/17, 07:46 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Agree
07/07/17, 07:46 - Arne: Ofc
07/07/17, 07:47 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I'm sorry for your loss
07/07/17, 07:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Did she die yesterday or a while ago?
07/07/17, 07:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The comma is fucking me up
07/07/17, 07:49 - Arne: A couple months ago, but I never cried before that
07/07/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ok
07/07/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I understand how you feel
07/07/17, 07:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And not to sound insensitive, but the comma is unnecessary
07/07/17, 07:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Sorry
07/07/17, 07:50 - Arne: It is, surely
07/07/17, 07:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
07/07/17, 07:51 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: That happens a lot to intps. We dont know what to do with our feelings so we ignore them. But eventually feelings get out
07/07/17, 07:51 - Arne: My two "best friends"  (I normally never say best friends, but what they mean to me) just ended the friendship. I was there, I talked to them
07/07/17, 07:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
07/07/17, 07:52 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Fuck
07/07/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: What should I say?
07/07/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Should I even say something?
07/07/17, 07:53 - Arne: You don't need to
07/07/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
07/07/17, 07:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Phew
07/07/17, 07:53 - Arne: We don't know each other, and probably don't care. It's normal
07/07/17, 07:53 - Arne: Good for me I'm an INTP, so I can see that
07/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm currently a representative of strangers on the internet
07/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I feel like I need to feel
07/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂😂😂😂
07/07/17, 07:54 - Arne: I got that sometimes too
07/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
07/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Weird
07/07/17, 07:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I met this kid on a game who just randomly said that he used to cut himslef due to depression
07/07/17, 07:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Now I can't just fucking cut ties with him...
07/07/17, 07:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because I represent the other strangers who play the game
07/07/17, 07:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And if I reject him, who says that the other people who play the game he like won't reject him too?
07/07/17, 07:57 - Arne: Understandable, I know some girl in our school, who did the same and had a depression, kinda also anorexia. 
She was like two months in our class, but then she left (bad grades) before she told me her story and stuff, and when I now see her walking I don't know what to do. 
Except this is not the internet, I am sorry for her, but I doesn't feel it
07/07/17, 07:57 - Arne: Or at least, not enough, I think
07/07/17, 07:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We understand how they feel, and why they feel like they do
07/07/17, 07:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We can empathize
07/07/17, 07:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But we're screwed the moment we need to do something
07/07/17, 07:59 - Arne: True
07/07/17, 07:59 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Do you belive in god ?
07/07/17, 07:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: No reason not to
07/07/17, 07:59 - Arne: Who?
07/07/17, 08:00 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Any god
07/07/17, 08:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And I don't like existential crisis
07/07/17, 08:00 - Arne: I don't believe.
07/07/17, 08:00 - Arne: In God.
07/07/17, 08:00 - Arne: Not that there is any problem with someone who does. This might sound a little bit uhhhh cold
07/07/17, 08:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Nah
07/07/17, 08:01 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I understand why you don't believe
07/07/17, 08:01 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I can't prove that god exists and i can't prove that it doesn't
07/07/17, 08:02 - Arne: The way he should be, or better, the change that he is how we describe him, is pretty small
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Why he ?
07/07/17, 08:03 - Arne: Idk
07/07/17, 08:03 - Arne: He is
07/07/17, 08:03 - Arne: "our father"
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why even have a gender? Speaking as a religous person
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Why not she
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why even have a form
07/07/17, 08:03 - Arne: Just saying, the church says so
07/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why even make some random ass universe?
07/07/17, 08:04 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂😂
07/07/17, 08:04 - Arne: "Our father, who is in heaven... "
07/07/17, 08:04 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Amen
07/07/17, 08:04 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂
07/07/17, 08:04 - Arne: I don't know the translation tho
07/07/17, 08:04 - Arne: And I don't know the whole text
07/07/17, 08:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Why give a shit about some random dust on a floating piece of bigger dust in the universe you created for shits and giggles?
07/07/17, 08:05 - Arne: Until I was in high school, I had to go once a month to church
07/07/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I had to go weekly
07/07/17, 08:05 - Arne: We are made from star dust, I think that should mean somethibf
07/07/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I said dust...
07/07/17, 08:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Meh
07/07/17, 08:06 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I used to belive in god. I used to pray a lot, i asked god for really simple things but he wont answer and bad things keep happening to me
07/07/17, 08:06 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: So one day i stoped and i started asking my self Big questions
07/07/17, 08:07 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I started thinking logicaly
07/07/17, 08:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Dude
07/07/17, 08:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Logic won't help you
07/07/17, 08:07 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I found no reason to belive in god
07/07/17, 08:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: There is nothing to disprove a god
07/07/17, 08:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Which is why there are religions
07/07/17, 08:08 - Arne: The story about the earth is made... It's way to easy
07/07/17, 08:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ikr
07/07/17, 08:08 - Arne: How the earth is made*
07/07/17, 08:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I just disregard the discription that genisis gives
07/07/17, 08:09 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I just accept that 7 days bullshit as superfluous
07/07/17, 08:09 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: To add spice
07/07/17, 08:09 - Arne: Bit that's likely not true, so why would the other things be true..
07/07/17, 08:09 - Arne: Not like the whole tings is fake
07/07/17, 08:09 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm not saying it's false though
07/07/17, 08:09 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: That's the problem
07/07/17, 08:09 - Arne: But if there is one thing false, why not more things
07/07/17, 08:09 - Arne: No prob
07/07/17, 08:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Who's to say that god didn't cause the big bang with the intention of creating us?
07/07/17, 08:10 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: A lot of stuff in religions are just bullshit with all my respects
07/07/17, 08:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's alot cooler tbat way too
07/07/17, 08:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I believe that god started the cause-and-effect chain
07/07/17, 08:11 - Arne: In the Bible stands how God created us. Not hoping for a theory, and make a theory who fits in the other theory. It is not how it works
07/07/17, 08:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: With him being the original cause
07/07/17, 08:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The bible was writen by people, noylt god
07/07/17, 08:11 - Arne: I hope its clear what I said
07/07/17, 08:12 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And those people's knowledge wasn't passed down in writing
07/07/17, 08:12 - Arne: The church should not be something what stands between you in god
07/07/17, 08:12 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It was definitely distorted when they started writing the Bible
07/07/17, 08:12 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The curch is not god
07/07/17, 08:13 - Arne: But why is the church there, and claiming God is real, but also hoping for people to believe it's real, but how they see him is different then your perspective?
07/07/17, 08:13 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Honestly
07/07/17, 08:13 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Religion is distorted
07/07/17, 08:13 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The bible was warped and re written
07/07/17, 08:14 - Arne: You went to church, the Christianity, catholic, all those religions are there for thousands of years, why should you know it better?...
07/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't
07/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: So you know the real religion, the one that's not distorted ?
07/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: No
07/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm saying that there are possibilities
07/07/17, 08:14 - Arne: Yeah OK
07/07/17, 08:14 - Arne: Indeed
07/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And that the current religion isn't 'right'
07/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And neither is it'wrong'
07/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂😂😂
07/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Come on
07/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And I'm not saying what I believe is 'right'
07/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Did I ever try to convince you?
07/07/17, 08:15 - Arne: It's good
07/07/17, 08:16 - Arne: I'll stop
07/07/17, 08:16 - Arne: I just came to sence
07/07/17, 08:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: You an aetheist
07/07/17, 08:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Cool
07/07/17, 08:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I understand why
07/07/17, 08:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: No reason to convert others though

07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Except isis
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Thwir shit isn't even islamic
07/07/17, 08:17 - Arne: True, the people with the wrong mind set do
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: We're just arguing
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Our passionate god demands you blood'
07/07/17, 08:17 - Arne: Is is supports the Islam, but people generalize to much on the Islam itself.
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Compassionate*
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I used to be a muslim
07/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Belive me
07/07/17, 08:18 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Islam is the religion of war and blood
07/07/17, 08:18 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Isis they represent the real islam
07/07/17, 08:18 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: The Islam of mohamed's era
07/07/17, 08:19 - Arne: You are right about that. But there is a difference to get an own state with using violence, and with just using the religion itself, I thought. Or isnt that true
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If religion never changed then there'd be a crusade happening right now
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Against science
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Homosexuality
07/07/17, 08:21 - Arne: You are right
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The death toll would put the fucking holocaust to shame
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They might have even joined the fucki g holocaust
07/07/17, 08:21 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: One thing i respect in christianity is that it came in peace no war no sword
07/07/17, 08:22 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They went after gay guys did they not?
07/07/17, 08:22 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They wouldn't have  agreed completely though
07/07/17, 08:22 - Arne: Also disabled people?
07/07/17, 08:22 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Which is why I said they wouldn't agree
07/07/17, 08:22 - Imeldaroswara: This is how I think...same thing like you cannot teach a 3 years old about nuclear reaction....
Same thing is happening in the relationship between God and humans.

God reveals a little bit of Himself and His knowledge through the progress of science.
07/07/17, 08:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Their views aren't 100% aligned

07/07/17, 08:24 - Imeldaroswara: Uhm...religion wars...there is a page dedicated for all wars ever created in and between religions. Sadly Christian is one of the religions there.
07/07/17, 08:24 - Imeldaroswara: *wikipedia page
07/07/17, 08:25 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Jesus crist never fought anyone never killed anyone
07/07/17, 08:25 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Mohamed did
07/07/17, 08:26 - Imeldaroswara: That's true, but later on his so-called followers did, started in europe... cmiiw.
07/07/17, 08:26 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I think all religions are made by man
07/07/17, 08:26 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: And i might be wrong
07/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: But for now i think that
07/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And we can't disprove your belief
07/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Its not à belief
07/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It is
07/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Just toughts
07/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Okay
07/07/17, 08:28 - Imeldaroswara: There is a Christian apologist who said.... Science can answer the hows but not the whys or whos.
That's true though.
07/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But we can't disprove it
07/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: I dont belive in anything but science
07/07/17, 08:29 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And I believe that science isn't sepperated from religion
07/07/17, 08:29 - Arne: This is good to hear. You believe in God, your relationship with God counts.
07/07/17, 08:30 - Arne: Not the relationship with the church itself.
07/07/17, 08:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I love how the word 'know' hasn't appeared in the conversation yet
07/07/17, 08:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because we honestly don't know shit
07/07/17, 08:30 - Arne: Wow that is a new record for me
07/07/17, 08:30 - Imeldaroswara: +1
07/07/17, 08:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: We have no evidence to back up what we say
07/07/17, 08:31 - Arne: True
07/07/17, 08:31 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: This is just a pissing match abkut who can believe the hardest 😂
07/07/17, 08:32 - Arne: Some of the message from me above I wanted to use it though. Not in the way I use it as, "I know it is a fact "
07/07/17, 08:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Which is what I meant
07/07/17, 08:33 - Arne: Islam will win probably, and atheist. I think
07/07/17, 08:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or should I say "The phrase 'I know...'"
07/07/17, 08:33 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yup
07/07/17, 08:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because Christianity wouldn't view it as a compitition
07/07/17, 08:34 - Imeldaroswara: The thing is when it's about religion or faith or believe, no one is allowed to force anyone to believe in anything.
1. We started in the same base line.
2. We each have different experiences / background

This is the reason why INTP doesn't like authority I guess.
07/07/17, 08:35 - Arne: I don't think we don't like authority. It's more the way they do
07/07/17, 08:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
07/07/17, 08:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Authority is necesary
07/07/17, 08:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The world would suffer without it
07/07/17, 08:36 - Arne: Indeed.
07/07/17, 08:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's just the way thatauthority can be exercused is bullshit
07/07/17, 08:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Exercised*
07/07/17, 08:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's not every day I start the day off with a nice, wholesome religious debate

08/07/17, 15:51 - Lulu: Lol
08/07/17, 15:51 - Maureen: like intrusive thoughts

08/07/17, 15:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I can get sadistic as fuck with the right people
08/07/17, 15:52 - Maureen: but you have to be sadist to be a psycophath
08/07/17, 15:52 - Lulu: Lol
08/07/17, 15:52 - Lulu: Same
08/07/17, 15:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You need to be a psychopath to be a sadist. A psychopath doesn't care about others emotions. And the sadist doesn't care about the enemy's emotions. See the link?
08/07/17, 15:53 - Maureen: don't you experience intrusive thoughts like "let's push xy down the bridge"?
08/07/17, 15:53 - Lulu: And sometimes if I'm tired and my inhibitions be gone I can make some pretty sharp comments to people lol
08/07/17, 15:54 - Lulu: Not exactly, a sadist cares, a sadist enjoys inflicting
08/07/17, 15:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The sadist doesn't care
08/07/17, 15:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's how he inflicts
08/07/17, 15:55 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>

08/07/17, 15:57 - Lulu: But psychopathic, you don't really need to be

08/07/17, 15:59 - Lulu: But yeah, caring about how someone feels doesn't mean you need to care about them being happy, you care about the negative

08/07/17, 16:00 - Maureen: 🔪🐴☄
08/07/17, 16:01 - Lulu: I wouldn't say my thoughts of the sort are exactly intrusive

08/07/17, 16:02 - Lulu: Although I also do think I am a nice person, it's specific people who I want to bug I don't necessarily // want to watch the World burn

08/07/17, 16:08 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: pyschopaths don't act out as often and can be subtle. Some of them could keep to themselves their whole lives
08/07/17, 16:08 - Lulu: Self harm to such an extent is more suicidal than masochistic, isn't a big part of masochism that someone else is inflicting?
08/07/17, 16:08 - Tel: Hm, idano about that.. Sadists like the pain of others. Which would not be in line with a psychopath. A psychopath being devoid of empathy.. Meaning they wouldn't understand the pain in order to enjoy it
08/07/17, 16:09 - Tel: Wouldn't the two be incompatible?
08/07/17, 16:09 - Lulu: ☝
08/07/17, 16:09 - Maureen: not necessarily. if you find pleasure in hurting yourself or just by the thought of ot
08/07/17, 16:10 - Lulu: But I don't find pleasure in the thought
08/07/17, 16:10 - Lulu: I just like blood
08/07/17, 16:10 - Maureen: have you ever watched your own blood dripping of a wound you did to yourself?
08/07/17, 16:10 - Lulu: TBH I felt like that a lot when I was like 14-15, I don't much anymore
08/07/17, 16:11 - Lulu: Hah sadly yes, intriguing
08/07/17, 16:11 - Lulu: I never cut myself deep or anything
08/07/17, 16:11 - Lulu: Just scratches
08/07/17, 16:11 - Maureen: I loved it 🙈
08/07/17, 16:11 - Lulu: Little beads
08/07/17, 16:11 - Lulu: I don't, I was just frustrated
08/07/17, 16:12 - Lulu: And wanted to feel and see something that would make me feel human
08/07/17, 16:12 - Maureen: I wanted to see my blood and it calmed me down
08/07/17, 16:12 - Lulu: I regretted every time
08/07/17, 16:13 - Maureen: I cut myself for 10 years now...
08/07/17, 16:13 - Lulu: Seeing your own blood rush is a fixating thing though
08/07/17, 16:13 - Tel: I'd also say that psychopaths are more likely to show signs - they are more likely to be in the criminal justice system according to some articles (not the best source, but - https://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/psychopath/psychopath-vs-sociopath-what-s-the-difference/)

10/07/17, 14:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's more like a discussion group. It's not dead, just with breaks in convo due to the time zones

10/07/17, 14:31 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Oh that's cool. Thanx Jash,  I assume there's all age groups here. I could use some insight being in my early 20s
10/07/17, 14:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No problem. Yep there are various age groups. I'm 17
10/07/17, 14:35 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: High scholar.  I was  some socialite back then, then this phase came

10/07/17, 14:42 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Whoa that's awesome.  Can you guys say your attitude on being social has changed? I'm concerned about how much I tend to care and at the same time pull away from real friends
10/07/17, 14:42 - FABIO: A lot
10/07/17, 14:43 - FABIO: Im really social when needs to
10/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm only social at work
10/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm a physical therapist so I have to
10/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
10/07/17, 14:44 - FABIO: And toutch... I couldnt do that
10/07/17, 14:44 - FABIO: Hahahaha
10/07/17, 14:44 - FABIO: Passion works in a strange manner
10/07/17, 14:44 - Maureen: me
10/07/17, 14:44 - Maureen: me too
10/07/17, 14:45 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Yeah I get those days. Mostly over holidays because it's a nice time to catch up.

But over school season I'm like @56984845077 and treat Co workers to cover up that social need
10/07/17, 14:47 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha getting physical is another topic yah, I only force it with my intp friends
10/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: Ussualy i dont like physical toutch... dont see the need in it
10/07/17, 14:48 - Maureen: I'm around kids 8 hours a day, sometimes even more. I have to be open and kind.
since I'm open minded and not shy at all (only about love stuff) it's easy to be social at work. to be honest I've always been social. but I need my time alone at home or in my smoke break. plus I need the school breaks more than anyone else. it's physical pain when I have to work in the holidays
10/07/17, 14:48 - Tel: I think my attitude has developed rather than changed.. I'm more aware. I hang around other Ns more (historically natural gravitation, even before MBTI entered my life). We extrovert our N, so I'm much more extroverted with them..
10/07/17, 14:49 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahah I have to I have no choice
10/07/17, 14:49 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I work with severe patients so 😹
10/07/17, 14:49 - Tel: Same with Ne.. I try deliberately extrovert my T, but that's harder as I don't get what others are missing (a lot, sometimes!)
10/07/17, 14:49 - Tel: Melisa - clinician?
10/07/17, 14:49 - Maureen: when it's consensual I love physical touch. you know those touchy people? I love them 🤗
10/07/17, 14:51 - FABIO: I hate then
10/07/17, 14:51 - FABIO: Hahahahaha
10/07/17, 14:51 - FABIO: I have a friend i never even touch hands with hin
10/07/17, 14:52 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Lol I wonder how you flirt then. I suffer at that
10/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: Flirt is another topic
10/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: This is precissely calculated to me land in bed
10/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: There. Im a killer..
10/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: 😏
10/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂
10/07/17, 14:54 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Weird enough same thing with me. I picked out similar friends before having found out about the test. I can also say I'm aware, hence I'm concerned. 

Just get quiet moments where I question myself why it's so consistent with me
10/07/17, 14:55 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha most cases after initiating Netflix and Chill.
10/07/17, 14:55 - FABIO: 😂😂
10/07/17, 14:56 - FABIO: Dont know if i still good at it
10/07/17, 14:56 - FABIO: Im in a relstionship for 1.5 years now
10/07/17, 14:56 - FABIO: Even living with my girlfriend
10/07/17, 14:58 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: That's totally awesome,  I used to find it hard to commit as a teen. Now I'm finding it hard to be in a serious relationship,  which I do want
10/07/17, 14:59 - FABIO: Just need to find the one
10/07/17, 15:00 - FABIO: That is not crazy
10/07/17, 15:00 - Tel: Interesting.. I also. Have found that I naturally prefer to hang out with INFJs. Quite a few of my friends are! I only have 1 S friend that I'm really close with, excluding school friends who I put up with rather than actually enjoy convo with.. I figure mostly Ss
10/07/17, 15:00 - FABIO: Hahahahaha
10/07/17, 15:00 - FABIO: Mine is an infp
10/07/17, 15:01 - Tel: Also, I don't think it's weird. Only 22% of the population is N - so guess it's natural to stick by your own kin. As a white middle class male, I guess this is the closest I'm going to get to being a minority...
10/07/17, 15:01 - Tel: Kin, in this sense, means this dichotomy.. :p
10/07/17, 15:02 - Tel: Also Keith - what are ya concerned re?
10/07/17, 15:03 - Janith: Intuitives prefer hanging out with other intuitives because they think alike
10/07/17, 15:03 - Tel: Yup
10/07/17, 15:03 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Lol I find it unnecessary to actually psychoanalyze people.  I get annoyed by that meme that says INTPs do that. I can stop an interesting IN from a far so that keeps me going
10/07/17, 15:04 - Tel: How ya mean?
10/07/17, 15:04 - Tel: You can spot?
10/07/17, 15:06 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Just my mindset with friends. See most don't really understand how my mind works, and they find it dodgy how I disappear for a while then come back playing like everything is normal.  It is to me, not them, can tell
10/07/17, 15:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's precisely what drives people away from me
10/07/17, 15:09 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha for some reason my high school friends kept me. I think putting in some effort helps, I don't think you being pushed away.
10/07/17, 15:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I tried genuinely but no avail lol
10/07/17, 15:10 - Tel: Nah, ppl don't understand me either generally. Esp school friends or colleagues - unless they converse with me for a decent amount of time
10/07/17, 15:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly. The conversation is necessary. And that's the part I'm worst at. I can never make small talk, which makes it boring and it's just a matter of time before they catch someone else 😂

10/07/17, 15:14 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Small talk really sucks. And it's what you gonna get throughout the relationship so might as well spot your type, I normally find them sitting alone. As hard as it is to start a conversation, I find myself doing it. Sugar rush
10/07/17, 15:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I did find a guy who was intp eventually
10/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Oh hi Keith
10/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Introduce urself? 😂
10/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Btw guys
10/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: I think there is one INTP in my class
10/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: However,she is even more quiet than me
10/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: I'm not sure though because I barely talked to her
10/07/17, 15:16 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: We just conversating about social lives. Welcome mate
10/07/17, 15:16 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: What happened?
10/07/17, 15:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He kept me company as much as he possibly could
10/07/17, 15:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Does she read when others are messing around?
10/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Not sure actually 😅 we sit far away from each other
10/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: I think I'll observe more
10/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: First
10/07/17, 15:18 - FABIO: Talk To her
10/07/17, 15:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol this is all reminding me about my high school days

10/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: How should I start talking
10/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: Since I barely talked to her before
10/07/17, 15:19 - Amin: Ok every body hates me
10/07/17, 15:19 - FABIO: Hi
10/07/17, 15:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How I used to have to find an empty place to sit after others settle down together 😂
10/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: Haha
10/07/17, 15:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: ??

10/07/17, 15:28 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Compliment,  talk of something she can actually input on. See where that takes you
10/07/17, 15:29 - FABIO: Creep is nice
10/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: Cool,I have a lot too...
10/07/17, 15:29 - Arne: Kampf* in the Netherlands it's illegal to have that book
10/07/17, 15:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep it's really interesting
10/07/17, 15:29 - FABIO: 😂😂

10/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: Why?What information does it have?
10/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: I think that's just stupid
10/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: It's not like a cursed book or anything
10/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: I don't care if the book is illegal or legal. But that you don't know why people hate that guy?...
10/07/17, 15:31 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I know why.
10/07/17, 15:31 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I only like him for his ability to dictate.  Haha something like Eric cartmen. Fun to learn
10/07/17, 15:31 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've read books on Second World War 😂
10/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: Idk never read it 🤣 just his sick ideas.
10/07/17, 15:32 - Didier: What happens if u r caught with it
10/07/17, 15:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's not your conventional book. I can tell you that much. Though I'm not done reading it yet
10/07/17, 15:32 - Arne: You know why, but you said it like, you as an person, don't get it.
10/07/17, 15:32 - Didier: Take a picture when u r reading haha
10/07/17, 15:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well, he killed millions, even the US killed millions of Japanese
10/07/17, 15:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If at all, both should be hated equally
10/07/17, 15:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But they're not
10/07/17, 15:33 - Arne: They should.
10/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's why I can't understand that
10/07/17, 15:34 - Arne: But because others aren't hated for their crimes. Does that mean some doesn't deserve to be hated?
10/07/17, 15:34 - Didier: To be honest,I see anyone taking part in the war is not any better
10/07/17, 15:34 - FABIO: Exactly
10/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @6582280971 it's like a very very cheap book. You can get it easily if you're interested
10/07/17, 15:34 - Didier: Okay haha
10/07/17, 15:34 - Arne: Deserting people have a high risk to get killed by their own people. You don't really have a choice.
10/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Cheap as in it's price. I like the book tho
10/07/17, 15:35 - FABIO: Us is the same as hittler
10/07/17, 15:35 - FABIO: Even worst.. 9/11 was an inside job
10/07/17, 15:35 - Didier: True,but what about the leaders?
10/07/17, 15:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Tell me more about it
10/07/17, 15:35 - FABIO: Usa
10/07/17, 15:35 - Arne: Still no evidence, but i wouldn't be surprised
10/07/17, 15:36 - FABIO: No way... 2 planes could be hijacked and no one intercept

10/07/17, 15:36 - FABIO: No way jet fuel will melt an build like that
10/07/17, 15:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Apparently that ia the evidence
10/07/17, 15:36 - Arne: That's the whole thing, the leaders get them in to war and the people are stupid enough to follow them.
10/07/17, 15:36 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Can you gimme the books name and author
10/07/17, 15:36 - Arne: Until they realize..

10/07/17, 15:37 - FABIO: No high chief at the towers
10/07/17, 15:37 - Didier: Social pressure u can say
10/07/17, 15:37 - Arne: Yeah
10/07/17, 15:38 - Didier: Even those countries that did not want to participate in the war did so in the end
10/07/17, 15:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Some hedges made billions off it rather
10/07/17, 15:38 - Tel: Hm, do INTPs do conspiracy theories - things, by their nature, that are without any facts?
10/07/17, 15:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Which countries?
10/07/17, 15:38 - FABIO: Its engineering facts
10/07/17, 15:38 - Tel: Re 9/11.. There's plenty of evidence that debunks the conspiracies
10/07/17, 15:38 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: No. We are facts
10/07/17, 15:39 - Arne: Okay, why is Bush not in prison?
10/07/17, 15:39 - Tel: Hm, I'm tempted to day point them out and let's debate.. But I'm watching labyrinth of lies and it requires me to read subtitles :/
10/07/17, 15:39 - Didier: Sry,can't remember 😂 All I rmb is that there were them
10/07/17, 15:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh 😂 I feel really sorry for Poland. Especially after I saw Schindlers list
10/07/17, 15:40 - Tel: Free falling tower.. Debunked. Melting steel.. Debunked.. No plane at pentagon, debunked. What else is there?
10/07/17, 15:41 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Lol matters of conspiracy, the system and spirituality is a never ending topic. Watch these people go
10/07/17, 15:41 - Tel: :D
10/07/17, 15:41 - FABIO: Melting steel debunked? Never saw it
10/07/17, 15:41 - Tel: Hm K, I'll show
10/07/17, 15:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What do you guys think about Ku Kux Klan?
10/07/17, 15:42 - Tel: Ps it didn't melt. It lost its strength through heat
10/07/17, 15:42 - FABIO: Even if melted.. the whole building?
10/07/17, 15:42 - FABIO: Please
10/07/17, 15:42 - FABIO: It hat neougth stell to hold
10/07/17, 15:42 - Tel: KKK = bunch of idiots that were beaten by superman (true story)
10/07/17, 15:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The whole building doesn't need to melt
10/07/17, 15:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Just the supports
10/07/17, 15:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Bjt it's improbable
10/07/17, 15:43 - Tel: https://youtu.be/Kl0tHx36RRQ
10/07/17, 15:43 - Tel: Check that for instance
10/07/17, 15:43 - FABIO: It hit one floor
10/07/17, 15:43 - FABIO: The others.would resist
10/07/17, 15:43 - Tel: It's one I've watched before. There are others that discuss the structure of the tower's and tower 7 and highlight their weaknesses and how it could have happened
10/07/17, 15:44 - Tel: Jet fuel, affected by gravity, would go down.. Paper catchers light on various floors, etc
10/07/17, 15:44 - FABIO: Papers wouldnt got close to the heat necessary
10/07/17, 15:44 - Tel: One floor in the top. Third of the bulling goes, and then the top of the hulking collapses in, etc.. I'm not an engineer and I don't remember all of the facts, but I'm noting the general items from the research into it
10/07/17, 15:45 - Tel: Again, it depends re what heat you need
10/07/17, 15:45 - Tel: You don't need to melt the steel - you need to weaken it
10/07/17, 15:45 - Tel: If you melt plastic so it's liquid, it takes a lot of heat. But you can heat it a little and it becomes extremely flexible
10/07/17, 15:45 - FABIO: Yes... but it had a lot of steel.. it was an high buildng it was dimensioned to take more
10/07/17, 15:45 - Tel: Same with steel. Around 7-800 C I think?
10/07/17, 15:46 - FABIO: No.. steel is more
10/07/17, 15:46 - Tel: Well, apparently not really
10/07/17, 15:46 - Tel: Melting, yes, but not to become malleable under the right weight
10/07/17, 15:46 - Tel: Watch the video I posted
10/07/17, 15:46 - FABIO: Watched
10/07/17, 15:46 - Tel: Or the many others out there. None dispute that
10/07/17, 15:47 - FABIO: In my point of view
10/07/17, 15:47 - FABIO: Or the enginners the security sistem everyone was bad at what they di
10/07/17, 15:47 - FABIO: Do
10/07/17, 15:48 - FABIO: Or it was inside job
10/07/17, 15:48 - FABIO: You cant hijak 3 planes
10/07/17, 15:48 - FABIO: Hit two towers and the pentagonon
10/07/17, 15:48 - Tel: 1100 C, rather than 800 - fair point, but way lower than the req temp to melt
10/07/17, 15:49 - Tel: Even since 9/11 planes have been hijacked, with extensive security now in place. If it's still possible, what makes a well. Coordinated attack in a much softer system hard to do?
10/07/17, 15:49 - FABIO: Going to the test
10/07/17, 15:49 - FABIO: See ya
10/07/17, 15:49 - Tel: Have fun :l

11/07/17, 01:43 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Does anyone else struggle with narrowing out potential mates because you can see all sides of a relationship w. Each?
11/07/17, 01:47 - Juancho: ✋🏽
11/07/17, 02:01 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: With regards to factoring in your hypothesis about each pre-meditated situation you feel would happen if you're together... Even though it's all raw educated guessing and unreliable...? Yeah, I did that a lot and felt like I was shooting myself in the foot after I moved on from each pursuit
11/07/17, 02:05 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Not wanting to lose out on a benefit gained compared to other potentials, but there would always be unique benefits from each choice and I couldn't weigh in pro's and cons reliably without a ton of second guessing
11/07/17, 02:16 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Okay but my Ne is well developed so I'm almost always correct. Or am I manipulating my environment to fit my Ne?
11/07/17, 02:17 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Sounds like you haven't had a healthy relationship then?
11/07/17, 02:17 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: That's quite a possibility. I'm guilty of the former without knowing it... Even if my Ne has a good track record
11/07/17, 02:25 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: So you think others exposed to how often you might be intuiting things would get jealous (or feel you're delusional for trusting it) since you're not always basing it on pure fact?
11/07/17, 02:26 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: I had kind of protected myself from one, maybe subconsciously due to my own environmental/job situations where I felt I couldn't contribute commitment I felt would be needed
11/07/17, 02:26 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Kind of self sabotage really...
11/07/17, 02:28 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Well not just one, but several over the last 10 years... Environment was only a factor in the last 5 years. Anxiety was a bigger factor in the first 5 years
11/07/17, 02:28 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: So do the opposite and just throw myself into them, not choosing, constantly being in love triangles. It's such teenage bullshit
11/07/17, 02:33 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: It really is bs... And I had such an Avoidance to it because the bad/immature parts of  cycle I knew just wouldn't be worth it
11/07/17, 02:41 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Then the one I recently chose to really pursue (after factoring in my choices) accused me of settling for her because of convenience and ease, and she kinda threw all that doubt at my face due to her own insecurities of thinking I only wanted a relationship because of her available compared to others who are busy with activities and less available
11/07/17, 02:42 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Because Of her own availability*
11/07/17, 02:46 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: It was a LDR anyways that's formed with her so availability I guess doesn't matter... Well phone/video call communication might but the other ones I've not pursued all were closer to me proximity wise and in the same country. So not sure how I couldn't get the part about convience not being a factor.
11/07/17, 02:53 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Okay but couldn't you see that having a primarily electronic relationship actually be more convenient than a face-to-face, morning breath, insecurity/jealousy, mundane life relationship? Proximity has nothing to do with convenience.
11/07/17, 02:57 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Well I travel every week and is been about 95% work travel for 5 years... So they would all start out as LDR... The others having more potential there for easier visits more often being state side
11/07/17, 02:59 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Also someone outside the county factors in all these visa mix ups. As soon as I want to settle down or stop traveling, the electronic relationship would become jeopardized unless I went locally to their country or something else escalates
11/07/17, 02:59 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Someone Outside the country*
11/07/17, 04:48 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Do you think intp good for sales/marketing jobs?
11/07/17, 04:48 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Anyone here works as sales/marketing?
11/07/17, 04:52 - Aaron: I've worked in sales for a while, and I have to say my Ne helped me alot with determining what exactly they were looking for and what it would take to sell them something without asking too many obvious questions
11/07/17, 04:55 - Tel: I worked in retail.. Wasn't challenging enough. Did help me massively with my Fe development though, I think. Depends where you want to get to / do in the future.
11/07/17, 04:57 - Tel: Challenging enough re Ti. I'm also too disorganised to manage the opening of a shop on time I found.. This was when I was 18-23 though.. The thing I like about my current role is that I manage a lot of managers who are largely *S*J types :D
11/07/17, 04:57 - Tel: #bliss
11/07/17, 04:57 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: How do you tell your Fe developed? I hate mine
11/07/17, 04:57 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I want Fi instead
11/07/17, 04:59 - Tel: Hm, good question.. I think their the interactions with others and being challenged to emphasise with them. Whether helping punters with addiction (I worked in Ladbrokes, for my seemingly many sins) or pushing colleagues to chase their dreams
11/07/17, 05:00 - Tel: Ne might help identify it.. But I guess the Fe provides a reason for helping?
11/07/17, 05:01 - Tel: I've found the Fe most difficult to analyse over the years, as I believed my Fe to be crap (I still don't think it's great). But, through deeper understanding, it's a lot better than I thought it was.. I do, though, continue to rationally undertake a lot my Fe actions (ie to get better productivity, I need to be more Fe)
11/07/17, 05:02 - Tel: But you need to have a developed Fe, I'd suggest, in order to make meaningful inroads..
11/07/17, 05:02 - Tel: Open to discussion on that though, as ever. It's something I'm still analysing (again, as ever.. :p)
11/07/17, 05:10 - Didier: Fi sucks when u see things like dogs getting abused
11/07/17, 05:15 - Tel: Hm, isn't that more Fe? Fi is more internal harmony no?
11/07/17, 05:15 - Tel: Might be wrong..
11/07/17, 05:15 - Didier: It's fi
11/07/17, 05:16 - Didier: I know because I'm actually an infp here 😂

11/07/17, 05:20 - Tel: Interesting re the pics.. It's more about how you deal with things, not the stimuli as I was incorrectly alluding to
11/07/17, 05:20 - Tel: I saw a link on some forum a week or so ago :)
11/07/17, 05:20 - Tel: Figured it'd be interesting to view!
11/07/17, 05:21 - Tel: I'm an INTP, and I'm actually going through the OPP mbti practitioner course atm.. One more day left next week and I'll be certified
11/07/17, 05:22 - Tel: Am hoping that'll help me understand the differences between types better really, as well as opening a new career path should I want it
11/07/17, 05:22 - Tel: #essay. Sorry! :D
11/07/17, 05:22 - Tel: How about you? How long ya been on the group?

11/07/17, 05:25 - Didier: No I didn't 😂
11/07/17, 05:25 - Didier: Most knew
11/07/17, 05:25 - Tel: Hm, someone who can certifiably take someone through the mbti questionnaire and then explore the dichotomies with them.. OPP owns it in Europe, CPP in america (ie distribution and certification register or whatever)
11/07/17, 05:25 - Didier: I a slight preference for f than t
11/07/17, 05:26 - Didier: Cool...How old r u?

11/07/17, 05:26 - Didier: That
11/07/17, 05:27 - Tel: Haha - yea, to be young again.. Though, at your age, I wanted to be older!
11/07/17, 05:27 - Didier: How old do u have to be?
11/07/17, 05:28 - Tel: Unsure. Don't remember seeing an age restrict tbh. It costs a whack, though, and I was the youngest person there by a decent margin (rest were at least near 40, if not over)
11/07/17, 05:28 - Didier: Woah
11/07/17, 05:29 - Didier: Only in the US am I right?
11/07/17, 05:29 - Tel: If thinking for yourself, would suggest consolidating your own experience and learning online (that's what I did, though I started at about 25). I knew most of the theory before I attended the course, but it gave me the tools to help others explore, plus the insight into others dominant preferences
11/07/17, 05:29 - Tel: I'm UK
11/07/17, 05:29 - Tel: It's distributed across the world.. Don't know exactly where, but in lots of places

11/07/17, 12:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: His mother left...

11/07/17, 12:20 - Janith: Awesome
11/07/17, 12:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Not even 5 min and she's tired of out shit
11/07/17, 12:20 - Janith: ... Not his mother leaving
11/07/17, 12:20 - Janith: I don't think she's a fan of Einstein 😂
11/07/17, 12:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Haha
11/07/17, 12:21 - Janith: Maybe more of a newton person
11/07/17, 12:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or a Tesla fangirl
11/07/17, 12:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: She must be an xSFJ. So I guess not😂
11/07/17, 12:21 - Arne: She used to be a fan, still, now she is an aircondition
11/07/17, 12:21 - Janith: Freud it is then 😂
11/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: xSFJ parents are worse
11/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That personality is worse
11/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I hate them
11/07/17, 12:22 - Janith: He's literally the only sensor I know among well known scientists
11/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Who ?
11/07/17, 12:22 - Janith: I have an ISxJ father. He sucks too
11/07/17, 12:22 - Janith: Freud
11/07/17, 12:23 - Janith: Almost everyone else is an intuitive
11/07/17, 12:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I solemnly respect him if x=T
11/07/17, 12:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Else i can pretend to
11/07/17, 12:23 - Janith: I still won't. His logic is off
11/07/17, 12:24 - Janith: Don't bother. Respect is earned
11/07/17, 12:24 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Sensors don't see on a wider perspective, as many as I have come across
11/07/17, 12:24 - Janith: Granted he is the kinda guy you respect for the fact that he's really handy
11/07/17, 12:25 - Janith: Agreed. But they're absolutely essential to keep society running I think
11/07/17, 12:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I actually respect those who atleast respect rationality
11/07/17, 12:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yup. They are good at managing stuff
11/07/17, 12:25 - Janith: My father is religious 😂
11/07/17, 12:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And xSxP are my favorite sensors
11/07/17, 12:26 - Janith: On that note from a purely logical standpoint an intuitive and a sensor getting married is very beneficial
11/07/17, 12:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Maybe x=F
11/07/17, 12:27 - Janith: Granted there's gonna be plenty of Argument but at least the intuitive won't have to worry about the mundane aspects of social existence
11/07/17, 12:27 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, I would prefer my INFP girl, anyway😂
11/07/17, 12:27 - Janith: I'm unsure. I think T but can't say
11/07/17, 12:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I had the same confusion with my father
11/07/17, 12:28 - Janith: INFPs are too good for me 😅😂
11/07/17, 12:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: If he is ISFJ, then he might be dual.
11/07/17, 12:29 - Janith: Dual?
11/07/17, 12:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are both, traditional but also value nee stuff
11/07/17, 12:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are reserved , but good at socialising
11/07/17, 12:30 - Janith: Nah. My father is totally traditional
11/07/17, 12:30 - Janith: It's almost nauseating
11/07/17, 12:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That is also the case of mine
11/07/17, 12:30 - Janith: How do you deal with yours?
11/07/17, 12:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He wants me to accept tradition as it is
11/07/17, 12:31 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: A smile is a curve tht sets everything straight😉
11/07/17, 12:31 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I doubt he was intuitive once upon a time
11/07/17, 12:32 - Janith: Well that won't work for me 😅
11/07/17, 12:32 - Janith: I am not crazy about smiles
11/07/17, 12:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My father believes that the little innocent boy that i was years ago Is still out there in me
11/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: Wow..
11/07/17, 12:33 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I just have to nod unwillingly when I realize that the case is out of handling
11/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: 😂
11/07/17, 12:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He is actually too much of religion that tends to avoid logic and questioning if those rules are true or not
11/07/17, 12:39 - Janith: Same with mine too. I'm just glad that he's not at home most of the time
11/07/17, 12:40 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: <Mídia omitida>
11/07/17, 12:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Same here. He lives abroad and comes on a vacation once or twice an year. So, I get my freedom that he would tend to take from me, like daydreaming at my pleasure.
11/07/17, 12:42 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Daydreaming is somethings that sensors don't appreciate and I crave for iy
11/07/17, 18:06 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Maybe not SJ's, but I think most this most the SP's I know appreciate letting their mind wander

12/07/17, 13:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: If she goes too much out of control, try forcing her to listen her to a song of dhinchak pooja
12/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: Her whistling is so loud
12/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: She does all sorts of things to annoy me
12/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: Well okay I'll try later haha
12/07/17, 13:24 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But please shut YOUR ears while doing it
12/07/17, 13:24 - Didier: Cover my ears?
12/07/17, 13:24 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: She is the greatest insult to music

12/07/17, 13:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Please!!! It is not worthy of being called a song
12/07/17, 13:26 - Didier: I had more than enough living with her for 13 yesrs
12/07/17, 13:26 - Didier: Haha
12/07/17, 13:26 - Didier: I'll search it now
12/07/17, 13:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: "dilo ka shooter hai mera scooter"  is a worse version of "London bridge is falling down"

13/07/17, 10:18 - Imeldaroswara: What happened?
13/07/17, 10:24 - Imeldaroswara: So... I've been thinking about poison.... Is it possible to create a poison that will react only when a certain body condition is fulfilled...?

Usually in detective movies/series, in an investigation of a homicide, they will put more effort in looking for who is the last person that the victim met.

So let's say... The housemaid hates the master, because the master abuses her. So, she put in the poison in her master's milk that he drinks every night. The poison trigger is related to heartbeat. If the host's body has heartbeat more than 135, the poison will react and starts to choke all the venas/arteries into and from the heart.
The thing is the master has habit of exercising every morning. Thus, his habit creates the perfect opportunity for the perfect crime to happen. It will be like unconscious self suicide.

Hahaha.... 😈😈😈

Just me and my groom and the preacher. That will do. ☺

13/07/17, 10:48 - Didier: Hmm.Someone
13/07/17, 10:48 - Lulu: I'd rather have a really small thing where I don't need to wear an expensive dress and rather save that money for the future
13/07/17, 10:48 - Imeldaroswara: The horror..of "where am I going to put "my face"....? 
Accompanied by tears as psychological form of blackmail
13/07/17, 10:48 - Lulu: I'd wear red
13/07/17, 10:48 - Lulu: Or colors

13/07/17, 10:51 - Lulu: I'd want a bright red dress to right above at or below the knee that's all puffed out

13/07/17, 10:53 - Lulu: I guess weddings don't turn me off that much just the obligatory and blown up nature of it
13/07/17, 10:54 - Lulu: Of it having to be a certain way and all that
13/07/17, 10:54 - Maureen: for me, marriage is a sign of ownership. You have to belong to one person your whole life
13/07/17, 10:54 - Maureen: and I don't want that 🙈
13/07/17, 10:55 - Lulu: Lol
13/07/17, 10:55 - Lulu: Understandable

13/07/17, 10:59 - Maureen: sure but you can have that without an ownership. you can do that out of free will, not because you have to
13/07/17, 10:59 - Maureen: divorce is not an option for me
13/07/17, 10:59 - Maureen: 100%
13/07/17, 11:00 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>

13/07/17, 11:02 - Maureen: my sister and her husband got married in Dirndl and Lederhosen (traditional Bavarian, but they're not bavarian, only obsessed with this shitty state 😂)
13/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: Lol nice
13/07/17, 11:03 - Maureen: they had a Oktoberfest wedding
13/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
13/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: I'd probably get a plain red dress
13/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: Then a fluffy tulle skirt with it lol
13/07/17, 11:04 - Imeldaroswara: Too bad for an INTP, once the flirting time passed...and you no longer curious...your brain will start go shutdown...and that person could no longer "feel" attractive for you. LOL
13/07/17, 11:04 - Lulu: Maureen to be completely honest I'm not quite sure what that means
13/07/17, 11:04 - Imeldaroswara: Tutu seriously need to make a comeback to the fashion world.
13/07/17, 11:05 - Maureen: never heard of Oktoberfest?
13/07/17, 11:05 - Imeldaroswara: Isn't that like beer fest..?
13/07/17, 11:05 - Imeldaroswara: Cmiiw
13/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: Kind of, I mean the lederhosen and all that
13/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: Dhrindl
13/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: Or however it was spelled
13/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: Lol
13/07/17, 11:06 - Maureen: "What do you know about Germany?"
- "Lederhosen"
13/07/17, 11:06 - Lulu: Lamo
13/07/17, 11:06 - Lulu: LMAO*
13/07/17, 11:06 - Maureen: Google it
13/07/17, 11:06 - Maureen: Dirndl
13/07/17, 11:06 - Maureen: copy paste 😂
13/07/17, 11:07 - Maureen: that's what Germans are known of
13/07/17, 11:07 - Lulu: I did lol
13/07/17, 11:07 - Lulu: Oh those things
13/07/17, 11:07 - Maureen: traditional Bavarian clothes
13/07/17, 11:07 - Maureen: bavarian - not german 😂
13/07/17, 11:07 - Lulu: I got Ya now lol
13/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: Oh
13/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: I prefer a deeper darker red
13/07/17, 11:07 - Didier: Those that r elegant and mysterious
13/07/17, 11:08 - Maureen: Bavaria is only a part of germany because they have to - they don't even want to...
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: TBH I'm just v into having a red fluffy dress with my curly hair running barefoot in grass every day
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Sounds fun
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Idk
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: I like dark red but
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Eh
13/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: It doesn't excite me
13/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: XD
13/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: Sounds like u r a free soul
13/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: It feels very cool and calm to me
13/07/17, 11:11 - Didier: I like scarlet red but it's too "bam"
13/07/17, 11:12 - Maureen: I fear that I would want to break free from the time I get caught up in this wedding thing.
I want to stay with one person all my life but I don't need a ring for that
13/07/17, 11:12 - Didier: Really?
13/07/17, 11:13 - Lulu: Like I like dark red but it seems too
13/07/17, 11:14 - Lulu: Ominous I guess?
13/07/17, 11:14 - Lulu: Like I feel like it's a comforting color u wear in the fall and winter on a hoodie
13/07/17, 11:14 - Lulu: Or on socks
13/07/17, 11:14 - Lulu: Or on ur lips
13/07/17, 11:14 - Lulu: I'm more for it being an accent color
13/07/17, 11:15 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
13/07/17, 11:15 - Didier: Oh,I can see scarlet red looking glamorous
13/07/17, 11:15 - Didier: While velvet red is cool
13/07/17, 11:15 - Lulu: Brighter
13/07/17, 11:16 - Lulu: Yeah
13/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: Haha
13/07/17, 11:16 - Lulu: Like "WEEEEEE"
13/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: I get it
13/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: WEEEEE
13/07/17, 11:16 - Didier: Makes u high
13/07/17, 11:16 - Lulu: I love how vibrant colors stick out on cloudy days
13/07/17, 11:16 - Lulu: Even better
13/07/17, 11:16 - Lulu: Lol
13/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: Remember to
13/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: Tell us about ur wedding
13/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: I rmb we r about the same age so
13/07/17, 11:17 - Didier: 😉
13/07/17, 11:22 - Lulu: Lolll
13/07/17, 11:23 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
13/07/17, 11:23 - Lulu: That struggle when ur taller than the average female
13/07/17, 11:24 - Lulu: Rip these pants still look good tho
13/07/17, 11:31 - Didier: Is that ur home toilet
13/07/17, 11:31 - Didier: It looks so clean
13/07/17, 11:33 - Lulu: Yesirree
13/07/17, 11:46 - Imeldaroswara: So, I've been thinking why the divorce rate seems getting higher and higher.....
13/07/17, 11:46 - Imeldaroswara: Is it because we have been brainwashed by the media...?
13/07/17, 11:46 - Lulu: People just jump into stuff
13/07/17, 11:46 - Lulu: They don't think before going
13/07/17, 11:46 - Lulu: They just go
13/07/17, 11:46 - Lulu: Like yay well be in love forever
13/07/17, 11:47 - Imeldaroswara: So, we have some kind of predefined assumptions of what marriage should be... Or what marriage should make you "feel" like...
13/07/17, 11:47 - Lulu: That's why long term engagement is important
13/07/17, 11:47 - Imeldaroswara: And when it doesn't fulfill that "blissful" feeling aspect.....then the marriage is considered as fail one..
13/07/17, 11:47 - Lulu: Marriage is basically u found someone that you wouldn't mind spending ur life with and working through rough patches with
13/07/17, 11:48 - Lulu: And basically living life with and it can be hard
13/07/17, 11:48 - Lulu: Lots of people don't consider the hard stuff tho
13/07/17, 11:49 - Maureen: lots of people give up too easily
13/07/17, 11:49 - Imeldaroswara: But the thing is... I see my parents relationship okay..... They have been married like 30years++...
What I have seen is like they argued A LOT... Even for the stupid things like traffic jam... It's embarrassing sometimes...
13/07/17, 11:49 - Imeldaroswara: But they still stick together... And that's make me wonder why...
13/07/17, 11:50 - Imeldaroswara: They definitely not into comedy romance drama movie....or chick-lit novella.... Hahaha... can't even imagine..
13/07/17, 11:50 - Maureen: I mean cheating is really bad. nobody should ever cheat. you lose trust in the other one. but work on it! 
do you think our great grandparents never cheated or did some really bad stuff? but they hung out until death tore them apart
13/07/17, 11:51 - Maureen: but that's the ideal
13/07/17, 11:51 - Imeldaroswara: So...to me...it seems like when they are entering the marriage....they have "zero" expectations of what marriage should be/supposed to be...
13/07/17, 11:51 - Maureen: that media part is about romantizising weddings and everyone want it just to have a pretty celebration
13/07/17, 11:51 - Imeldaroswara: And with zero expectations, lower disappointment, and you can "tolerate" each other better.
13/07/17, 11:52 - Imeldaroswara: Weddings are billions dollar businesses...
13/07/17, 11:52 - Imeldaroswara: Bridezilla....LOL..
13/07/17, 11:52 - Maureen: my parents got married after 1.5 years because there was a baby (me). most of my life they hated each other and pushed each other into alcoholism
13/07/17, 11:54 - Imeldaroswara: So..the later generations...with very high exposures from media, twitter, facebook, instagram, etc... We see other people's life through the rose-colored lenses.... And when we have the same thing like what people have...but theirs seems better...we start to feel disappointed and instead of feeling grateful...we despise what we have...
13/07/17, 11:54 - Janith: Whoa
13/07/17, 11:55 - Janith: What exactly are we talking about?
13/07/17, 11:55 - Imeldaroswara: I wonder why....what things that made them hated each other...
13/07/17, 11:55 - Imeldaroswara: Just marriage in general
13/07/17, 11:56 - Imeldaroswara: And whether the higher divorce rate is related with exposure to the medias, such as facebook, twitter, Instagram...
13/07/17, 11:56 - Janith: Wait. Is someone here getting married?
13/07/17, 11:57 - Janith: Social contract mainly meant for the negotiation of property rights between families... Right?
13/07/17, 11:57 - Imeldaroswara: None...it started wih Lulu sending photoes of weddings...then we move to bridal dresses...red especially.. then we move on to the marriage and weddings
13/07/17, 11:58 - Arne: Back in the day it was impossible to divorce. And maybe if it happened, everyone saw you as a failure
13/07/17, 11:58 - Janith: Exposure to media, unrealistic expectation, exaggerated importance of "the one" and "falling in love"
13/07/17, 11:58 - Imeldaroswara: Marriage as in the sign of ownership as defined by Mauree 😁
13/07/17, 11:59 - Imeldaroswara: +1
13/07/17, 11:59 - Janith: Basically Yeah. Signing ownership. Outdated custom I think
13/07/17, 11:59 - Arne: https://youtu.be/v-iUHlVazKk

This was send before. It might be interesting
13/07/17, 12:00 - Janith: Maybe a divorce between the legal bindings of the contract and the romantic aspects of the marriage is in order
13/07/17, 12:00 - Imeldaroswara: Sometimes I think it's better to get married....without really knowing each other... 
So you will at least get surprised by either one dumb thing/smart thing that your spouse do... Hahaha... That's the excitement my friends..
13/07/17, 12:01 - Janith: Thanks. Will check it out
13/07/17, 12:01 - Janith: Just imagine your spouse turning out to be an ESFJ or something 😂
13/07/17, 12:02 - Janith: I'd rather know the person to a satisfactory degree before I decide to make a lifetime commitment to them
13/07/17, 12:02 - Imeldaroswara: Then just enjoy the roller coaster looo...
13/07/17, 12:02 - Imeldaroswara: YOLO...
13/07/17, 12:02 - Janith: So why spend it with someone dull and uninteresting???
13/07/17, 12:03 - Imeldaroswara: Well...the positive side of me said... I will transform him to be someone bright and charming and lovable dork...
13/07/17, 12:03 - Janith: Literally the reason I'm single now. Haven't been able to find anyone interesting
13/07/17, 12:04 - Imeldaroswara: The negative side of me.... perfect vicgtim for the perfect crime...
13/07/17, 12:04 - Janith: The thing is... I don't like changing people I care about
13/07/17, 12:04 - Janith: If I start messing with someone like that then I'm gonna end up treating them like an experiment
13/07/17, 12:05 - Janith: Bad idea. Spouse tends to get suspected fairly quickly
13/07/17, 12:05 - Janith: Also with our inferior function being Fe it'll be hard to emulate grief
13/07/17, 12:06 - Maureen: but then work on every rock that's in your way. don't give up on the first mountain just because you can't lift them doesn't mean you can't climb
13/07/17, 12:06 - Imeldaroswara: But not if you can portray yourself as lovable spouse..
13/07/17, 12:06 - Janith: Even then. Lacking other suspects the spouse becomes one
13/07/17, 12:07 - Janith: The perfect victim id a person you've never met in an area you never go to
13/07/17, 12:07 - Janith: *is
13/07/17, 12:08 - Imeldaroswara: This is what puzzles me...
The big question of...

Is it worth it? 
For this person...to go through all the valleys and the mountains...

Usually, it will be a resounding answer of no.
13/07/17, 12:09 - Imeldaroswara: Oh...tgere us a thing called.. exchange murder... So A wants to kill B, and C wants yo kill D... So they switch the victims...in order to remove the "motivation" part from the investigation.
13/07/17, 12:09 - Imeldaroswara: Arrghh...typo...😖
13/07/17, 12:09 - Janith: Depends on what they're doing
13/07/17, 12:09 - Imeldaroswara: Anyway you all know what I mean..
13/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: Yes I do but even then you leave a connection
13/07/17, 12:10 - Imeldaroswara: If your spouse kills someone...will you still love your spose?
13/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: A completely unconnected victim is best
13/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: Totally
13/07/17, 12:11 - Imeldaroswara: But then what is your motivation to kill that person.. even an assassin can get caught sometimes..
13/07/17, 12:11 - Janith: Unless that someone was on my short list of people I care about. In that case.... Problem
13/07/17, 12:11 - Maureen: but exchange murder would be manslaughter right? because of the lack of motive
13/07/17, 12:11 - Imeldaroswara: So...love is supposed yo be "blind"...
13/07/17, 12:11 - Maureen: or lack of connection
13/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: Mine would be that I just wanted to kill someone
13/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: Not quite. Murder is murder.
13/07/17, 12:12 - Imeldaroswara: Then you're a psycho... Hahaha..
13/07/17, 12:12 - Maureen: manslaughter not murder - different charges if caught
13/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: Nooo... Blind love is idiotic
13/07/17, 12:12 - Maureen: no there's a difference
13/07/17, 12:12 - Imeldaroswara: I remember there is an episode in Bones...about this kind of exchange murder..
13/07/17, 12:12 - Imeldaroswara: Ah...Bones... I love that series
13/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: Sociopath my dear 😉
13/07/17, 12:13 - Janith: Right. Thanks for the info. I didn't know that
13/07/17, 12:13 - Maureen: K, so I have a little love issue
13/07/17, 12:13 - Maureen: now that someone mentioned it 😂
13/07/17, 12:13 - Janith: Lay it on us
13/07/17, 12:14 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: <Mídia omitida>
13/07/17, 12:14 - Janith: There's no one better to give advice on love than a type who cannot understand the concept of emotions 😂
13/07/17, 12:14 - Imeldaroswara: Ah ya..that one..
13/07/17, 12:14 - Maureen: there's a colleague I feel very attracted to. but I just know a relationship wouldn't work. but attraction... meeeeh
13/07/17, 12:14 - Janith: English please. I can't French :/
13/07/17, 12:15 - Maureen: 💯
13/07/17, 12:15 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Enstein : how i see the world
13/07/17, 12:15 - Janith: Why would you kill someone? And would you love a spouse who killed someone?
13/07/17, 12:15 - Imeldaroswara: I can... French that is...especially with fries...
13/07/17, 12:15 - Janith: Why wouldn't one work?
13/07/17, 12:15 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: 😂😂😂
13/07/17, 12:15 - Imeldaroswara: YOLO
13/07/17, 12:16 - Janith: I did not know Einstein wrote a book 😅
13/07/17, 12:16 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: Its not his
13/07/17, 12:16 - Amin: Yo
13/07/17, 12:16 - Imeldaroswara: It's pseudo-einstein
13/07/17, 12:16 - Janith: Oh... So the "I" is kinda pointless 😂
13/07/17, 12:16 - Janith: Ll
13/07/17, 12:16 - Janith: *lo
13/07/17, 12:16 - Maureen: I just know. she never texts back, I never know what I am to her...
13/07/17, 12:17 - Maureen: French sex...
13/07/17, 12:17 - Amin: 😂😂😂
13/07/17, 12:17 - Janith: Ask her maybe? 😅
13/07/17, 12:17 - Amin: Though I mostly believe in OY
13/07/17, 12:18 - Maureen: maybe I tell her about the attraction and go from there...
13/07/17, 12:18 - Maureen: _*OI*_
13/07/17, 12:18 - Janith: If I have someone I'm interested in and I can't gauge how they feel then I tell her that I'm attracted to them
13/07/17, 12:19 - Janith: Blunt maybe but that's the best I got 😂
13/07/17, 12:19 - Maureen: how do you react when they say "sorry no"?
13/07/17, 12:19 - Amin: Dudel let me pm you the right way
13/07/17, 12:19 - Maureen: K
13/07/17, 12:19 - Janith: Just say "ah okay" and carry on with the conversation
13/07/17, 12:19 - Maureen: ah, not me 😂
13/07/17, 12:19 - Imeldaroswara: Chase her.....then ignore her...
Let her curiosity works against her for you..
13/07/17, 12:20 - Maureen: I just saw 4 and 9 @989306939802
13/07/17, 12:20 - Maureen: even then she wouldn't text 😂
13/07/17, 12:20 - Maureen: because she is someone who says "I text them later" and forgets about it
13/07/17, 12:21 - Imeldaroswara: But she read the message?
13/07/17, 12:22 - Janith: How very intp of her 😂
13/07/17, 12:23 - Maureen: my big guess is her being an INTP 😂
13/07/17, 12:23 - Maureen: but another orientation as I am
13/07/17, 12:23 - Maureen: sure - nothing gets unnoticed
13/07/17, 12:25 - Janith: Get her into this group!!!
13/07/17, 12:25 - Maureen: nah, I better not know anyone here personally 😂
13/07/17, 12:25 - Imeldaroswara: And we can persuade her...
13/07/17, 12:26 - Janith: Whyyy.. INTPs are the best people to know!
13/07/17, 12:26 - Janith: You'd love knowing me personally 😁
13/07/17, 12:26 - Didier: Yeah,so foolish
13/07/17, 12:27 - Janith: Err... I meant that in a friendship kinda way 😅
13/07/17, 12:27 - Didier: Yup
13/07/17, 12:27 - Imeldaroswara: I want to watch that 1 hour video.. and sleep afterwards..if I remember to sleep that is.. 
au revoir.... tomodachi...
13/07/17, 12:28 - Maureen: I know 😂
13/07/17, 12:28 - Maureen: but I don't want someone from my personal life on here
13/07/17, 12:28 - Maureen: the other way around is better
13/07/17, 12:29 - Maureen: bye - Tschüss
13/07/17, 12:30 - Janith: Aww.. And the beautiful Imelda is leaving us again. Have fun with the video 😊
13/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: So @4915127175996, just let her know you're attracted to her in conversation and find out
13/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: Keep your expectations neutral though
13/07/17, 12:33 - Didier: Maureen's love life?
13/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: Apparently
13/07/17, 12:33 - Maureen: always
13/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: Wait a sec
13/07/17, 12:33 - Janith: @6582280971 I think you'd be better here than I
13/07/17, 12:36 - Maureen: I asked her if she took the test - since she's into tumblr I guess she did
13/07/17, 12:37 - Janith: Oh good.. Though I presume an answer isn't guaranteed to come? 😂
13/07/17, 12:40 - Maureen: no 😂
13/07/17, 12:40 - Maureen: but I'll ask her again tomorrow 😂😂
13/07/17, 12:44 - Maureen: how do you react when they say "sorry no"?
13/07/17, 12:44 - Maureen: oh you did answer
13/07/17, 12:45 - Maureen: sorry 🙈
13/07/17, 12:50 - Janith: Haha no problem. Just make sure you don't dwell on the awkward silence
13/07/17, 13:13 - Maureen: I just hope she'll answer anything I can respond to normally @94754191589
13/07/17, 13:13 - Janith: Have any shared interests?
13/07/17, 13:17 - Maureen: kind of. the main point is that we share essential views
13/07/17, 13:17 - Maureen: on love, sex, marriage, children (drunk talks)
13/07/17, 13:18 - Maureen: and she doesn't care about a lot - she actually cares less than I do
13/07/17, 13:18 - Maureen: and that's perfect
13/07/17, 13:21 - Janith: Love is a good topic. You can let her know you're interested without straying too far from the original topic
13/07/17, 13:22 - Maureen: how?
13/07/17, 13:23 - Maureen: we talked about it on christmas
13/07/17, 13:32 - Janith: Hmm.. Bring up the possibility of different forms of love and if they're not the same brain circuitry firing for different purposes

Even though it's totally pointing out all my stupidities in my past relationships, but the explanations are quite make sense....
14/07/17, 07:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't think it's a gif. It's probably a short film

14/07/17, 16:31 - Imeldaroswara: Have you decided which major in uni?
14/07/17, 16:33 - Lulu: I'm doing General studies at a community college then transferring my credits to save money
14/07/17, 16:33 - Lulu: Also no I have fuck all idea of what I wanna do
14/07/17, 16:42 - Imeldaroswara: I always want a job which is not constraint by time and place.
A.k.a author

So my plan is to work until 2~3 years and save most of my salary...while collecting ideas for books..
Then just go somewhere quiet and cheap place to live and starts to write. In 2 years... it's either I become a writer or back to 9-5 job. 

Sigh... I wish it'll be the first though. I wish that I can laze around in a beach somewhere in bali while writing...  
Hahaha.... 
Paradise....
14/07/17, 16:47 - Imeldaroswara: Can you imagine what if harry potter is not a boy but a girl....?

Like, instead of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", 
it will be "Harriet Potter and OMG I am a wizard....<put fan girling shriek here>"...
14/07/17, 16:47 - Maureen: I would read the shit out of it 😂
14/07/17, 16:49 - Arne: Damn cool! But what kind of boom you gonna write? You probably know something you wanna have in your books...
14/07/17, 16:49 - Arne: Plz tell us!
14/07/17, 16:53 - Imeldaroswara: Hahaha...I still don't know...ideas come easy to my mind... Something about deepweb, the silkroad stuff, stuff related to IT (since it's my field of "expertise" or kind of), assassination...or forensic stuff..?

I have bought ebooks related to forensics...hahaha...so interesting2x stuff..

I have lots of google docs of bits and pieces of ideas and prologues and epilogues..
Still unorganized...
14/07/17, 16:54 - Arne: So it's connected with the world we life now in?
14/07/17, 16:54 - Imeldaroswara: Yeah...
14/07/17, 16:55 - Arne: Do you have experience with writing?
14/07/17, 16:55 - Imeldaroswara: I don't want to write a separate world...like Tolkien.. 
Seems like too much effort... Hahaha..
14/07/17, 16:56 - Arne: Haha, but not every world takes so much effort. He liked it. You can make a good epic fantasy book in a different world in half a year. (ofc depends on how you work, etc.)
14/07/17, 16:56 - Imeldaroswara: Little to none..☺
I was news team member in my college years.. mostly I wrote visit of this Professor / ambassador... Or something about new stuff in IT like quantum computer..
14/07/17, 16:56 - Arne: Profesionals do that at least.
14/07/17, 16:57 - Arne: Science will be there in your book? Will it be futuristic?
14/07/17, 16:57 - Imeldaroswara: Science..yes
Futuristic..maybe
14/07/17, 16:58 - Arne: I never thought about futuristic stuff to have in a book Tbh. I'm more of the fantasy stuff hehe

15/07/17, 21:16 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I guess
15/07/17, 21:16 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
15/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But thats sexism
15/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: How can I know if I m an Intp
15/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I get along well better with the boyfriends I had because of it
15/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: take the test
15/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I did
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I just feel so stupid 😂
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't think I am either
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm an introvert but
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: intps second guess them selfs
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't think I fit it this thingy
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I mean we all know the struggle right
15/07/17, 21:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: We want to find out who we are
15/07/17, 21:19 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But maybe intp description and this "test" is just way too convenient
15/07/17, 21:19 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: we are a cosmic dust 😂😂
15/07/17, 21:19 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Anyone want to talk about AI? 😬
15/07/17, 21:19 - ‪+91 98726 52067‬: Mbti is just a test and not some hard to follow rules. We all can learn new habits by practice and come over procrastination.
15/07/17, 21:20 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Good point Diman
15/07/17, 21:21 - Zahira: Same here
15/07/17, 21:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Reading about Intps I just want to meet other Intps to kind of have a small reflection of myself
15/07/17, 21:21 - Zahira: Lol
15/07/17, 21:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I hope I m not pissing anyone off 😂
15/07/17, 21:22 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: feel free to speak
15/07/17, 21:23 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm weird
15/07/17, 21:24 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: That's how I classify myself
15/07/17, 21:24 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: It's enough hahah
15/07/17, 21:24 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: basing on what u sad i dont think u're weird
15/07/17, 21:25 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: weird is a strong word
15/07/17, 21:25 - ‪+212 634-331559‬: i guess
15/07/17, 21:26 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't fit in that's what I mean
15/07/17, 21:26 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm 25
15/07/17, 21:26 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I work go home work fo home

15/07/17, 21:26 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: And do everything by myself
15/07/17, 21:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I can relate to the not fitting in part
15/07/17, 21:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I try to fit in by being funny, but it doesnt work well
15/07/17, 21:27 - Tel: Yes - sorry re delay; just finished watching 'A Monster Calls'. Great film, but sad!
15/07/17, 21:28 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Me either
15/07/17, 21:28 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahahs
15/07/17, 21:28 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I didn't even tried to fit in
15/07/17, 21:28 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Just at work
15/07/17, 21:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s alright Terry, i m glad you enjoyed it 😊
15/07/17, 21:30 - Tel: It's not a test.. Myers Briggs Type *Indicator*. It's an indicator - only you know what type you actually are. 

MBTI is basically the first step in Goleman's emotional intelligence model.. Self awareness comes before self management & social awareness, which both come before social management..
15/07/17, 21:31 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: People find me scary at first
15/07/17, 21:31 - Tel: The MBTI q'aire gives you some discussion points but you really ought to go through it with someone that's trained in it. I'd suggest understanding more re the cognitive functions, too.. But hard for me to tell you which way to learn if you don't have proper guidance re it
15/07/17, 21:32 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But others say I look so young and innocent
15/07/17, 21:32 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: The concept of Types seems really abstract, is it how your brain is wired and how it adapted to your environment ?
15/07/17, 21:32 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I think is kind of childish
15/07/17, 21:32 - Tel: Hm, good q. And yea, kinda.
15/07/17, 21:32 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: To classify people
15/07/17, 21:33 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: We already are isolating
15/07/17, 21:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What do you mean isolating?
15/07/17, 21:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Social conditioning?
15/07/17, 21:34 - Tel: Your dominant function = the one you use first and most; it's what you relied on as a young kid. You then use your 2nd as you need to use more than one function to get anywhere in life. That generally happens by your teens. Your third is meant to be in your young adult life, and inferior by midlife (late 30s at earliest, though I personally think you can bring it forward by increasing your awareness)
15/07/17, 21:35 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm lazy to do that
15/07/17, 21:35 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Dominant function
15/07/17, 21:35 - Tel: Also - this isn't about pigeon holing ppl. It's about developing your awareness of self and others. Nobody is the same, despite 16 types (more with step 2) - everyone has developed themselves in v different ways.
15/07/17, 21:35 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 🤔
15/07/17, 21:36 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Not worrying about others is a lot easier
15/07/17, 21:36 - Tel: Haha, yea, but depends on what your ambitions are really
15/07/17, 21:36 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What would be my dominant function for example?
15/07/17, 21:36 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Being an hermit
15/07/17, 21:37 - Tel: Plus your Fe (extroverted feeling) generally indicates that you do care about others, even if you're trying to ignore it :)
15/07/17, 21:37 - Tel: That's what I find anyway!
15/07/17, 21:37 - Tel: Tom - if you're an INTP, then dominant function is Ti (introverted thinking)
15/07/17, 21:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Ah so it s in order 😂
15/07/17, 21:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Good to know, thanks
15/07/17, 21:38 - Tel: You're 2nd is extroverted intuiotion, 3rd introverted sensing (depending which line of theory you belief; alternative is that Jung stated that this would be extroverted; inferior = extroverted feeling)
15/07/17, 21:38 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I always felt like being a weirdo but i went out of my comfort zone a lot..
15/07/17, 21:38 - Tel: Intuition*
15/07/17, 21:39 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I do too I'm kind of crazy
15/07/17, 21:39 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: People likes to be around me but I don't like them
15/07/17, 21:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Btw i feel weird asking other people that but if anyone wants to have a private chat I can talk a lot, to anyone 😬
15/07/17, 21:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I wonder if thats also an Intp thing,probably not
15/07/17, 21:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Sorry for my lack of response to your elaborate description Terry, I m still internalizing it
15/07/17, 21:43 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I used to chat with a lot of people in a page called interpals
15/07/17, 21:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Hm I m always careful with those pages, can you trace people from specific regions?
15/07/17, 21:44 - Tel: Np Tom - that's K! I'm in between films. Putting another one on now.. So I'll be msging slow anyway. If I don't respond, then give me a kick
15/07/17, 21:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: My country is really small and i m paranoid
15/07/17, 21:46 - Tel: Re talking a lot - I can too, about certain things. If I'm interested, then I'll never get bored.. Generally theoretical stuffs. Too much detail, though, tires me out - unless I'm already pretty expert (even if relative) in it and you're filling in the blanks. I'm still analysing myself in this regard, though..
15/07/17, 21:47 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Is good
15/07/17, 21:47 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I even had long distance relationship in that page
15/07/17, 21:47 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
15/07/17, 21:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is it true that Intp girls are alpha? 😂
15/07/17, 21:51 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Depends
15/07/17, 21:51 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: When I fall in love I get more calmed down
15/07/17, 21:51 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But yeah
15/07/17, 21:51 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
15/07/17, 21:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What if a guy asks you to make him a sandwich? Would that make you mad ? 😂
15/07/17, 21:54 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Depends in the way he asks
15/07/17, 21:54 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: And if he's the same with me too
15/07/17, 21:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: In a funny way i guess, it s obviously meant as a joke
15/07/17, 21:55 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I would be okay with it
15/07/17, 21:57 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Feels good to communicate with intps for the first time
15/07/17, 21:59 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I expected it to be still weirder, but we re all people after all
15/07/17, 21:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm not people
15/07/17, 21:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 👀
15/07/17, 22:33 - Tel: Lol
15/07/17, 22:34 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: This group dies often
15/07/17, 22:34 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I feel old here 😝
15/07/17, 22:35 - Janith: Are we that immature? 😂
15/07/17, 22:37 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Some
15/07/17, 22:37 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Haahha
15/07/17, 22:37 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I am really childish too
15/07/17, 22:38 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I think I watch mulan
15/07/17, 22:38 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Every time it came on tv
15/07/17, 22:45 - Imeldaroswara: Not when they are in love. They will become docile creature, but expected us to forget....anniversary dates, someone's birthday, etc. Please know that it doesn't mean that we don't care...hahaha.

I even make a reminder in my google keep for my grandparents/parents/siblings/uncles-aunties/cousins/nephews/nieces birthdays. 😅
Facebook birthday reminder is nice..but older generations don't  have facebook.
15/07/17, 22:46 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahahhaha
15/07/17, 22:46 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I think it depends
15/07/17, 22:46 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I like quiet guys
15/07/17, 22:46 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😩
15/07/17, 22:46 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But my relationship are so short
15/07/17, 22:49 - Imeldaroswara: But then it depends on your definition of "alpha". 

What I find out is due to my "NT"-ness...I never in the position of the one that loves the other person more.

Like... you're around is OK, you're not around is also OK.
So, don't expect me to be nervous/worry/in emotional wreck when you don't text me in a day. 

Most guys..esp the insecure ones cannot handle it. 
Maybe that's what makes INTP female alpha....🤔
Not sure...
15/07/17, 22:49 - Janith: How come?
15/07/17, 22:50 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm not an intp then
15/07/17, 22:50 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm clingy as hell
15/07/17, 22:50 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hhahajaj
15/07/17, 22:50 - Imeldaroswara: Curiosity about the other person is already fulfilled.
15/07/17, 22:50 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Don't last long
15/07/17, 22:50 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I get bored eventually
15/07/17, 22:51 - Imeldaroswara: I find out... often times... it's my brain that will sabotage my relationship... Hahaha..
15/07/17, 22:51 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I overthink and make trouble
15/07/17, 22:51 - Janith: I used to be the more emotional one in a couple of my past relationships with NT girls. Though eventually Ti would take over.
15/07/17, 22:52 - Imeldaroswara: Oh... I will cry like a baby after the breakup...but only like 1 or 2 days...but after that happy go lucky as a single lady again...
15/07/17, 22:52 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm so emotional when in love
15/07/17, 22:52 - Janith: This was the reason for my last breakup actually. Though I've found my solution for that
15/07/17, 22:52 - Imeldaroswara: +1 the Ti is definitely a safety net.... Hahaha
15/07/17, 22:52 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But in the process before am an iceberg
15/07/17, 22:53 - Janith: I always tend to switch off during a breakup. I literally feel nothing. There's just the impression that I should be feeling some loss or something
15/07/17, 22:54 - Janith: I wonder if INTPs aren't cut out for long term relationships with most types 😅
15/07/17, 22:54 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm break up I move.om so quickly
15/07/17, 22:54 - Janith: Since we get bored so easily
15/07/17, 22:54 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: That I start thinking if I really have feelings
15/07/17, 22:55 - Imeldaroswara: Man is in the reverse... You will be in wreck long after the breakup. We, women, although INTP still more tune in with our own emotions, although we are not necessarily say it.
15/07/17, 22:55 - Imeldaroswara: +1
15/07/17, 22:55 - Janith: So far I was only like that with one person
15/07/17, 22:55 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I enjoy my solitude
15/07/17, 22:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: The serious relationship I had were with introverts
15/07/17, 22:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Cause they understood me somehow
15/07/17, 22:56 - Janith: And even then I just recently switched off to her too
15/07/17, 22:57 - Janith: Yesss.. That's why I'm usually not too crazy about dating extroverts 😅
15/07/17, 22:57 - Imeldaroswara: +1....
That's why sometimes I stopped calling/texting the other person. But then usually they cannot accept it... bummer... It suffocated me....when someone wants to be with me like 24/7...😖
15/07/17, 22:57 - Janith: I need my space.
15/07/17, 22:57 - Janith: I was the 24/7 kinda person at one point 😂
15/07/17, 22:58 - Janith: My Fe is very chaotic under normal circumstances
15/07/17, 22:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't need.my space when I'm.on a relationship I change
15/07/17, 22:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm.a weird Monster
15/07/17, 22:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahahaj
15/07/17, 22:59 - Imeldaroswara: Oh God....

Leech that kinda sucking blood is the imagination in my brain... And since I hate leech/slimy stuff....so I kinda associate that person with leech... Hahaha...
15/07/17, 22:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Who wants to be.always with my BF kissing him going out and shit
15/07/17, 22:59 - Janith: @6590236374 I think the best long term relationships for us involve our computers 😂
15/07/17, 23:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: All.my relationship the serious.ones
15/07/17, 23:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Started.with long distance
15/07/17, 23:01 - Janith: Well I'm not parasitic 😂
When I meant 24/7 I mean like debating and learning about stuff all the time.

...though I can see that being detrimental to both our sanity
15/07/17, 23:01 - Lulu: Not exactly sure if I'm on the topic point here
15/07/17, 23:01 - Imeldaroswara: +1

My job excites me.
Even when they are still throwing errors....they are just like sulking and need to be coaxed a little bit.

Non IT person don't understand this...😅
15/07/17, 23:01 - Lulu: But I don't think I'd ever date someone over the internet who lived far off lol
15/07/17, 23:01 - Janith: Same 😂
15/07/17, 23:02 - Lulu: At least I could Def not start it that way
15/07/17, 23:02 - Imeldaroswara: I did.... Europe to Asia.... 
That's the farthest one I have..
15/07/17, 23:02 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I did many far away

15/07/17, 23:11 - Imeldaroswara: Especially since I live in different country from the rest of my families..
15/07/17, 23:11 - Janith: I'm literally terrified of it. I've been having breakdowns for most of my birthdays 😂
15/07/17, 23:11 - Imeldaroswara: Why?
15/07/17, 23:11 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahaha why
15/07/17, 23:11 - Imeldaroswara: Looking younger than your age is a benefit. Trust me.
15/07/17, 23:11 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I will be thankful later
15/07/17, 23:12 - Janith: I dunno. But I tend to hate my birthdays because of that
15/07/17, 23:12 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Now my patients see.me as an adorable thing
15/07/17, 23:12 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😝

15/07/17, 23:14 - Janith: Guess I'm just a sensitive guy 🙆‍♂
15/07/17, 23:14 - Janith: Presentation is overrated
15/07/17, 23:14 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
15/07/17, 23:15 - Janith: We just drop in, share some ideas and dissappear
15/07/17, 23:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: *drops in*
15/07/17, 23:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: *shares ideas*
15/07/17, 23:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: *disappears*
15/07/17, 23:16 - Janith: She looks like she's trying to say "human.. It's about time you got me food isn't it?"
15/07/17, 23:16 - Lulu: I think she may be tired lol
15/07/17, 23:16 - Janith: Oh yeah. We also lightly troll each other when some of the other guys are online
15/07/17, 23:17 - Lulu: She sleeps when I sleep
15/07/17, 23:17 - Janith: Well... That sounds terrible 😂
15/07/17, 23:17 - Lulu: If I take too long she just naps on a sofa near me until we go to bed
15/07/17, 23:18 - Lulu: I roll her to my room on my computer chair
15/07/17, 23:18 - Lulu: Like "it's time for bed baby! Up up!"
15/07/17, 23:18 - Lulu: Then she goes on the chair
15/07/17, 23:18 - Lulu: And we roll on
15/07/17, 23:18 - Janith: I would not do well with cats 😂
15/07/17, 23:19 - Imeldaroswara: I love dogs....always...
15/07/17, 23:20 - Janith: I'm more likely to scare then awake if I catch them napping 😈
15/07/17, 23:20 - Lulu: Aw noo
15/07/17, 23:20 - Lulu: Nina doesn't get much sleep sometimes
15/07/17, 23:20 - Janith: Doggo person too 🙋‍♂
15/07/17, 23:20 - Janith: How come?
15/07/17, 23:20 - Lulu: So must let my Mimi mini nini sleep
15/07/17, 23:21 - Imeldaroswara: Dogs will think of me as its world and majesty that needs to be worshipped and loved and obeyed...
15/07/17, 23:21 - Lulu: She is just always up and running around
15/07/17, 23:21 - Lulu: Being a random Ass little cat
15/07/17, 23:21 - Janith: INTP cat? O_o
15/07/17, 23:21 - Lulu: When I'm home she will most of the time follow me around and sit w me
15/07/17, 23:22 - Lulu: Or look out the window at birds
15/07/17, 23:22 - Lulu: Or just in general chill
15/07/17, 23:22 - Lulu: But like a deep good sleep, she needs
15/07/17, 23:22 - Janith: Pondering the works of Spinoza and Camus maybe
15/07/17, 23:23 - Imeldaroswara: That's not because she loves you... That's because she wants food.. hahaha
15/07/17, 23:23 - Janith: I wonder why cats are meaner than dogs though 😅
15/07/17, 23:24 - Imeldaroswara: Dunno....never have a cat the whole my life... Always dog..
15/07/17, 23:24 - Janith: Maybe because most wild cats are solitary hunters while wild dogs tend to be pack oriented
15/07/17, 23:25 - Lulu: Both of my cats are really sweet
15/07/17, 23:25 - Janith: So evolution made cats more concerned about their own survival while dogs became as concerned with the survival of the group
15/07/17, 23:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yup cats exhibit the same narcissistic behaviour as lions, but they re not "usually" hurting you because you are too big
15/07/17, 23:26 - Janith: That's just what they want you to think
15/07/17, 23:26 - Lulu: No,they are
15/07/17, 23:26 - Lulu: Byee
15/07/17, 23:26 - Imeldaroswara: My last dog when I was in high school... Named Lady Mozart.
The thing was the night before she disappeared...she insisted to sleep with me...usually she slept with my sister. As if she knew that she wouldn't see me again the next day.
I cried for days after she was gone... 
Even until now...if I remember and in mellow mood..
15/07/17, 23:26 - Lulu: Lol
15/07/17, 23:26 - Janith: That's an interesting bit of info
15/07/17, 23:26 - Imeldaroswara: You are their source of food...
15/07/17, 23:27 - Lulu: Yes
15/07/17, 23:27 - Janith: Noooo waaaaiitt
15/07/17, 23:27 - Janith: I'm sorrrryyy my darling 😭😭😭
15/07/17, 23:27 - Lulu: Nina knows when I'm sad or depressed
15/07/17, 23:27 - Lulu: Nina stays with me when others don't she is MY CHILD
15/07/17, 23:28 - Lulu: And I love her
15/07/17, 23:28 - Janith: I always pictured INTPs naming their pets after scientists or composers 😂
15/07/17, 23:29 - Janith: I guess animals are better at sensing the changes in our bodies depending on our moods
15/07/17, 23:30 - Janith: Since they don't really have the ability to use language like we do that would be their main way of communicating
15/07/17, 23:30 - Imeldaroswara: Hahaha... I am going to disappear now. I have fulfilled my quota of social interaction for today.

criminal dramas for the week 
+ doing some coding 
+ updating my music library... 

Life's a bliss...☺
except when it's time to get some food.... I need to go outside of my kingdom a.k.a my room. Sigh....

안녕하세요

15/07/17, 23:30 - Lulu: Even when I'm really damn depressed and I try to shut everything including her out she keeps on pushing her. Nose into the blanket
15/07/17, 23:30 - Lulu: Also
15/07/17, 23:30 - Lulu: Another thing
15/07/17, 23:30 - Janith: Have fun!
15/07/17, 23:30 - Lulu: If I wake up on the middle of the night to use the toilet
15/07/17, 23:31 - Lulu: She will wake up as well
15/07/17, 23:31 - Lulu: And either wait at the door for me
15/07/17, 23:31 - Lulu: Or get me to let her in
15/07/17, 23:31 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Anyone here working for google? 😬
15/07/17, 23:33 - Janith: Really close to your cats you are...one of them at least
15/07/17, 23:34 - Janith: Not as far as I can tell unfortunately
15/07/17, 23:34 - Lulu: The other one too, but she is especially  attached to me
15/07/17, 23:34 - Janith: Anyone know what new projects Google is up to lately?
15/07/17, 23:35 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They re planning to build their biggest data center (yet) in luxembourg
15/07/17, 23:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: <Mídia omitida>
15/07/17, 23:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: MIR WELLEN BLEIWEN WAAT MIR SIN 😂😂
15/07/17, 23:38 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It means : we want to stay who we are, a very significant sentence in our countries history
15/07/17, 23:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Google vs Farmer who wins
15/07/17, 23:41 - Janith: Now that's a showdown I want to see 😂
15/07/17, 23:41 - Janith: I kinda hope the father wins though
15/07/17, 23:42 - Janith: I have nothing against Google but if the one farmer doesn't want to move then he should be allowed to stay
15/07/17, 23:42 - Janith: Google should make their data center around the farmer's house
15/07/17, 23:42 - Janith: *property
15/07/17, 23:43 - Janith: It would give Google quite a bit of PR too
15/07/17, 23:44 - Janith: If they market it correctly
15/07/17, 23:44 - Janith: Like they value the individuality and the rights of the individual
15/07/17, 23:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Are you sure about that?
15/07/17, 23:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
15/07/17, 23:45 - Janith: Think about it. Internet giant lets farmer keep his land
15/07/17, 23:46 - Janith: When we have plenty of stories about companies trampling people just to get their own way
15/07/17, 23:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s a data center
15/07/17, 23:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And google i free
15/07/17, 23:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is
15/07/17, 23:46 - Janith: The service is but not the products
15/07/17, 23:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont think they need to worry about reputation
15/07/17, 23:47 - Janith: Just think of what it could do to the brand image
15/07/17, 23:47 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: That farmer wont make me buy a pixel phone neither
15/07/17, 23:47 - Janith: Everyone needs to worry about reputation
15/07/17, 23:47 - Janith: Google isn't in a monopoly market with a lot of its products and services
15/07/17, 23:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You re right, i think they should stick to their guns though since microsoft is taking everything over it seems
15/07/17, 23:48 - Janith: A move like this could increase Google's market shares across the board
15/07/17, 23:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Headline : "Google gets cucked by farmer"
15/07/17, 23:49 - Janith: Microsoft is an absolute beast. The only way any company is gonna face them down is with great PR
15/07/17, 23:49 - Janith: You're forgetting something. Google algorithms control a lot of the content we see 😉
15/07/17, 23:50 - Janith: All it'll take is some skillfull marketing and some tweaking of the ol search engine and Google could get a data center and a PR victory
15/07/17, 23:52 - Janith: In the end though the headline is gonna be "consumers get mass raped by monopoly companies" anyway
15/07/17, 23:52 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah but people will still rely on their preferred credible sources  rather than what the algorithm suggests first, i hope
15/07/17, 23:52 - Janith: Under current economic models if course
15/07/17, 23:53 - Janith: You seriously underestimate the laziness of people 😂
15/07/17, 23:53 - Janith: In either case, Google stands to lose very little here
15/07/17, 23:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You re right, people in my country are writing petitions for banning vaccines or at least make them optional 🤔
15/07/17, 23:55 - Janith: The world is going to hell.
15/07/17, 23:55 - Janith: I just hope we get a colony running on Mars before we start lobbing nukes at each other
15/07/17, 23:55 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: *waiting for superintelligent Ai to fix humanity*
15/07/17, 23:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I believe in super Ai 😂
15/07/17, 23:56 - Janith: They're more likely to treat us like slaves/pets than fix us
15/07/17, 23:57 - Janith: But considering how humanity has treated the world so far that might be just what we deserve
15/07/17, 23:57 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Machines have a purpose but no needs unless we give them needs, but why  would they need that?
15/07/17, 23:58 - Janith: Need what?
15/07/17, 23:58 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Needs
15/07/17, 23:58 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Sorry for my language

No matter what it is, it's probably punishable by death
16/07/17, 02:58 - Janith: Personally I avoid religious debate unless I feel like getting on someone's nerves

16/07/17, 06:48 - Tel: How come you particularly realise Islam though, it off curiosity? You posted the dubious Christian source again re Islam.. I think there are tons of good arguments vs Islam, but the source you use isn't a great one

16/07/17, 07:48 - Shaiju: The numbering system as you know it now began in India and popularized by Arabian travellers. Arabian contribution is limited to popularising the mathematical model. But again,it is difficult attribute everything to a single culture. The human knowledge (or ignorance) repository is the sum total of all the contributions from different tributaries of human life.

16/07/17, 15:43 - Juancho: I'm not going to prolong this 'debate' any further, i'm going ti make a final statement with sources
16/07/17, 15:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Bullshit. Aryabhatta introduced "0"
16/07/17, 15:46 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
16/07/17, 15:47 - Juancho: This guy
16/07/17, 15:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He was Indian. Plagiarisers
16/07/17, 15:47 - Juancho: I don't know which history books he read
16/07/17, 15:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The answer is none lol
16/07/17, 15:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He doesn't seem to be capable of reading books and absorbing knowledge considering his arguments 😆

16/07/17, 15:50 - Shaiju: If this could be of any use
16/07/17, 15:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Shakuntala Devi is impressive
16/07/17, 15:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Calculating faster than a computer whoa
16/07/17, 15:55 - Shaiju: That comment is inept. Nobody can match modern computers. The system in comparison was UNIVAC.
16/07/17, 15:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Obviously. But it's still a huge feat
16/07/17, 16:00 - Shaiju: I think there are lot of prodigies out there doing the same stuff. It's just that I don't consider it as a contribution to the world of mathematics. Ramanujan,Hardy etc contributed to the core mathematics while Shakuntala Devi just mastered the skill. It is like somebody recites a poem written by someone else while not writing a poem of their own.  While reciting is valuable skill, writing a poem is the original contribution.
16/07/17, 16:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I agree it's not a contribution. I just said she's impressive. Can you deny?
16/07/17, 16:04 - Shaiju: Nop... She is impressive especially while considering her  modest origin,born and brought up in the lower rung of socio-economic ladder,she managed to induce awe!
16/07/17, 16:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep. Exactly
16/07/17, 16:36 - Janith: I know I'm really late but happy birthday @14843534493!! 😁😁

16/07/17, 17:12 - Juancho: Told me to ignore them
16/07/17, 17:12 - Juancho: And just act aloof when they post somethig
16/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly
16/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Cus the world's full of so many people who know nothing yet want to cast an expert's impression
16/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's a waste of time
16/07/17, 17:13 - Tel: @50494800614 - what you're posting is racist, just FYI. Nothing wrong with passion, but you should not be labelling all Muslims with the same brush
16/07/17, 17:14 - Tel: Your argument is wasted because of your corrupted form of argument
16/07/17, 17:14 - Arne: I'm curious about his reaction, if there would be any... The roast is real
16/07/17, 17:14 - Juancho: Not the way I meant it
16/07/17, 17:14 - Juancho: I know some good muslims
16/07/17, 17:14 - Juancho: But this guy
16/07/17, 17:14 - Juancho: Just gets in my nerve
16/07/17, 17:14 - Tel: I know, but you really need to be careful with how you express yourself
16/07/17, 17:15 - Tel: Otherwise your argument loses because of extraneous info
16/07/17, 17:15 - Tel: I have struggled with that in the past too.. It's something you'll get better at, but I suggest you really need to go back and amend your comments to remove the Muslim references (at least making them non-generic)
16/07/17, 17:16 - Tel: No problem with an argument that disputes Islamic contribution to maths or science.. Just the way you portray the well collated facts
16/07/17, 17:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He'll have to delete the entire thing then I guess. IG comments can't be edited
16/07/17, 17:16 - Tel: Copy and edit, then delete and repost I guess?
16/07/17, 17:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You can't get through religious people because the the truth is not an option for them, you can roast him all you want he still thinks he has the moral high ground
16/07/17, 17:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah
16/07/17, 17:17 - Tel: I agree Tom - it's ruddy annoying. Haha
16/07/17, 17:17 - Tel: I abhor religion.. But you have to tolerate them I guess!
16/07/17, 17:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Many christians believe in evolution, it s something
16/07/17, 17:19 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Most*
16/07/17, 17:19 - Arne: And some of them believe in flat earth (:

16/07/17, 17:19 - Juancho: 🙃
16/07/17, 17:21 - Juancho: It was not until recently that they could not debate the data that they accepted it as a truth. And it makes no sense since the bible says humans came from Adam and Eve (came to existance out of nowhere and were like us)
16/07/17, 17:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What page is it tho? @50494800614
16/07/17, 17:21 - Juancho: It's instagram
16/07/17, 17:21 - Juancho: I started using it
16/07/17, 17:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I think modern christians believe in values rather than bullshit bible stories and afterlife/biblical god so I cant trash talk it completely
16/07/17, 17:22 - Arne: You have a lot more followers then me juancho
16/07/17, 17:22 - Juancho: Hahaha

16/07/17, 17:24 - Juancho: Wasn't aware. Happy Birthday.

16/07/17, 17:29 - Juancho: Yeah
16/07/17, 17:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Are there many professionals?
16/07/17, 17:29 - Juancho: Not sure
16/07/17, 17:29 - Juancho: I don't use it much
16/07/17, 17:31 - Juancho: My hate transcends race, ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status
16/07/17, 17:31 - Juancho: It's more on the realm of intelligence
16/07/17, 17:35 - Tel: Yup, so make that clear in your argument and it'll come across a lot better
16/07/17, 17:35 - Juancho: I did
16/07/17, 17:35 - Tel: Well, I'm referring to comments like 'you Muslims' ;)
16/07/17, 17:36 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Muslim is not a race
16/07/17, 17:36 - Tel: I understand your point, but others won't
16/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: Hm, it is a culture
16/07/17, 17:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: There are white muslims too
16/07/17, 17:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Living in Germany for example
16/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: That argument is semantic, as the end point is treating a large segment of ppl the same way due to the actions of some
16/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: Yup, of course there are
16/07/17, 17:38 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If it s not a race it s not racist which makes it okay to bash them because he wants to bash the ideology itself
16/07/17, 17:38 - Tel: OK, under UK law it is classed as racial discrimination
16/07/17, 17:38 - Tel: And we're in line with a lot of other countries in this regard
16/07/17, 17:39 - Tel: You can argue that if you want, but I disagree and don't see the point in that debate as it's one of my no-go areas - as in, there's nothing that can be said that'll make me think it's OK to treat ppl meant based on the actions of a few
16/07/17, 17:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What do you mean treat people?
16/07/17, 17:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I just feel like what they believe in is shit not the people themselves
16/07/17, 17:42 - Tel: Yup, I agree. But 'you Muslims' is the ppl, not the religion
16/07/17, 17:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Maybe he was only referring to the muslim part of their life 😂
16/07/17, 17:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I know
16/07/17, 17:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Pointless discussion
16/07/17, 17:44 - Juancho: That is exactly what I meant
16/07/17, 17:44 - Juancho: The religion
16/07/17, 17:44 - Juancho: Not the people
16/07/17, 17:45 - Juancho: Although I do judge them for following this religion
16/07/17, 17:47 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Well you have to look at it like that, they dont have the privilege to live in a society where critical thinking is treated as a good thing and each person has only so much "manipulation resistance" from birth. So it s not really their choice/fault
16/07/17, 17:47 - Juancho: It is
16/07/17, 17:47 - Juancho: They can pretend to follow the religion
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: This guy obviously does
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: He defended it publicly
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: When he didn't have to
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: I was raised in a Christian household
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: In Honduras
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: I still live here
16/07/17, 17:48 - Juancho: These people have zero tolerance for other religions
16/07/17, 17:49 - Juancho: But i'm 15 and an Atheist
16/07/17, 17:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They re also limited by IQ
16/07/17, 17:49 - Juancho: Very true
16/07/17, 17:50 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But I understand your frustration, many people dont really understand what it means to be part of a religion nowadays, it s treated like a voluntary act
16/07/17, 17:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What I m trying to say is
16/07/17, 17:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: For some people it s impossible to get out of that bubble, because they dont want to lose their "free" purpose and moral high ground in life
16/07/17, 17:52 - Juancho: Tom, you're an INTP. You don't need to explain yourself to us (explain ideas). We can piece things together quickly, ergo, not requiring you to elaborate.
16/07/17, 17:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: (explain ideas) ha you just did it yourself
16/07/17, 17:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You fool

16/07/17, 17:55 - Juancho: I did say explain yourself
16/07/17, 17:55 - Juancho: I meant ideas
16/07/17, 17:55 - Juancho: Because in debates you will have to explain yourself
16/07/17, 17:55 - Juancho: Not sure if you're following?

16/07/17, 19:01 - Tel: Hm, different personality types will react differently, stereotypically.. Also, societal conformity is v strong. Again stereotypically, INTPs are known for being quite radical and free thinking.. You'll come to accept the unfortunate reality that not everyone likes your radical nature. Some just want to do as they're told and carry on
16/07/17, 19:02 - Tel: (they're the type of ppl I truly don't understand / conflict with most..!)

16/07/17, 19:05 - Tel: The convo here sparked off a religious chat with a friend of mine staying over tonight. She's Muslim.. INFJ.. Was interesting (obv she's wrong..) but means we've taken a long break from watching Trainspotting T2!
16/07/17, 19:06 - Tel: Else, not much. Enjoying your chat above. V funny
16/07/17, 19:06 - Tel: Sup your end?
16/07/17, 19:09 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Cool, is that a common thing at your place to type people around you? I m watching Elon Musk on regulating existential threat of Ai, autonomous tesla cars on solar and a private Nasa. Sometimes i m looking at the material for my exam tomorrow!
16/07/17, 19:10 - Tel: Hm, I like to do it every now and then. Not for everyone, but some. Quite a few of my friends were at the same workplace as I and we all took the mbti q'aire, so it's something we have in common and discuss fairly regularly too
16/07/17, 19:10 - Tel: How'd you get involved in it?
16/07/17, 19:11 - Tel: Sounds like a neat video.
16/07/17, 19:11 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Some mysterious guy in a video game told me about it 😂
16/07/17, 19:11 - Tel: Didn't Elon say no to solar? Or am I misreading something earlier?
16/07/17, 19:11 - Tel: And what exam? Good luck!
16/07/17, 19:11 - Tel: Oo random!
16/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont know about that yet, Online and Media Law , it s really just Law though, not very interesting to me since it s only for Germany
16/07/17, 19:13 - Tel: Ah fair enough. I did my llb straight out of school.. You training to become a lawyer? Or?
16/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m studying IT 😂

16/07/17, 19:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah but it s all still intimidating to me
16/07/17, 19:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I know too little to judge the situation
16/07/17, 19:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: still technically a millennial right?
16/07/17, 19:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But AI and Security Systems "sound" exciting to me, and Big Data and all,but they re still just buzzwords for me, I really need to get into the field first... by researching mostly. Yes you are definetely a Millenial
16/07/17, 19:24 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Generation was maybe the wrong term
16/07/17, 19:27 - Tel: Haha yes, still a millennial, for whatever worth that term is

16/07/17, 19:28 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahaha
16/07/17, 19:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Me neither at times. Somehow I get along the rest of the time
16/07/17, 19:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Dont overthink!
16/07/17, 19:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Dude we're intp lol
16/07/17, 19:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m just trolling
16/07/17, 19:30 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahaha
16/07/17, 19:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Okay 😆
16/07/17, 19:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's 4 and I'm supposed to get up at 7:30. Laters people
16/07/17, 19:30 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm better and one to one conversation so f anyone wants to stalk me with messages I'm okay with it
16/07/17, 19:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: This is a group chat but most of the time 1 on 1 conversations
16/07/17, 19:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you can get over the fact that you re having a dialogue in front of 100 people it s okay right?
16/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: It's weird
16/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
16/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What did you expect from intp? 😅
16/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: My weird friend
16/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: That's why I like u already hahahah
16/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't know what to expect I'm awkward in general
16/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m like, always trying to justify my awkwardness
16/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But it s not working
16/07/17, 19:43 - Tel: Practice gives confidence! The point of mbti is to be aware of your strengths and development areas.. Pretty safe space here with all these INTPs to just be yourself :)
16/07/17, 19:43 - Tel: And try out something diff if ya want
16/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: What is to be yourself
16/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Im not really sure how I am
16/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: If someone figure it out
16/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I would be happy
16/07/17, 19:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is it impossible to assume that your brain must be wired in a certain way to be an intp?
16/07/17, 20:08 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: figuring it out is one of the biggest difficulties in a persons life and is the one to leads to the most constant source of happiness which is why you think you would be happy if you knew who you were, specially if you figured it out yourself
16/07/17, 20:13 - Juancho: @50497303509 ya leistes todo el chat o q?
16/07/17, 20:14 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: no por?

16/07/17, 21:51 - Juancho: My parents are making me go to church
16/07/17, 21:51 - Juancho: I'll have to feign illness

16/07/17, 21:53 - Juancho: On my way to church right now
16/07/17, 21:53 - Juancho: And there were three girls in the middle of the fucking road
16/07/17, 21:54 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: My parents gave up eventually
16/07/17, 21:54 - Juancho: When we honked the horn
16/07/17, 21:54 - Juancho: Bot there yet
16/07/17, 21:54 - Juancho: And they hit my mar

16/07/17, 21:55 - Juancho: I swear if a substantial percentage or the population didn't have ties with gangs i'd get down and punch them clean in their smug faces.
16/07/17, 21:55 - Juancho: My car*
16/07/17, 21:56 - Juancho: Ties to*
16/07/17, 21:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Talk to them
16/07/17, 21:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Tell.them that won't make u believe
16/07/17, 21:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: What's the point on goinf
16/07/17, 21:56 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Going
16/07/17, 21:57 - Juancho: Same thing I asked them.
16/07/17, 21:57 - Juancho: It was received with cold silence.
16/07/17, 21:59 - Juancho: At least I stalled them
16/07/17, 21:59 - Juancho: So that's less time
16/07/17, 21:59 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: My strategy
16/07/17, 22:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Was to go once a month
16/07/17, 22:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Hahahaha
16/07/17, 22:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: Only for them to shut up
16/07/17, 22:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: But after a while I just had a big fight with them
16/07/17, 22:00 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: That fixed it
16/07/17, 22:01 - Juancho: I have to go EVERY dreaded sunday
16/07/17, 22:02 - Juancho: I'm just too vulnerable right now
16/07/17, 22:02 - Juancho: They take away my phone and computers
16/07/17, 22:04 - Juancho: Luckily I have an e-money making method
16/07/17, 22:04 - Juancho: It's not exactly on the legal side of things
16/07/17, 22:04 - Juancho: Some might even consider it shady buisness
16/07/17, 22:05 - Juancho: But enough to buy a laptop and phone for when they take away mine
16/07/17, 22:19 - Lulu: Linking it down here for myself later lol
16/07/17, 22:38 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬ saiu
17/07/17, 00:02 - Juancho: Ok get thos
17/07/17, 00:02 - Juancho: This
17/07/17, 00:02 - Juancho: The church guy
17/07/17, 00:04 - Juancho: Was speaking about how god created the universe and everything in it in 7 days (I know, it's hilarious right but bare with me)
17/07/17, 00:05 - Juancho: He also said that god rested for several days
17/07/17, 00:05 - Juancho: After he created the universe
17/07/17, 00:06 - Juancho: Do after mass ended, I walked up to him and asked him: If god is omnipotent then why did it take him 7 days and why did have to rest.
17/07/17, 00:06 - Juancho: He looked simultaneously mad and confused.
17/07/17, 00:07 - Juancho: He told me I shouldn't be questioning god.
17/07/17, 00:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They also say that Adam was created from dust and eve was created by adam's twelfth rib
17/07/17, 00:07 - Juancho: I then proceed to ask him: That doesn't make much sense, are you saying I should follow him and what 'he says' blindly?
17/07/17, 00:08 - Juancho: "Precisely" he said.
17/07/17, 00:08 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
17/07/17, 00:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I studied this stuff in biology somehow
17/07/17, 00:09 - Lulu: Lol
17/07/17, 00:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: In theories of evolution
17/07/17, 00:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And there was this theory of catastrophism which said that god created and destroyed the universe several times
17/07/17, 00:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sounds like a jobless guy
17/07/17, 00:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Playing sims all day
17/07/17, 00:16 - Juancho: Hahahahahahahahahwh
17/07/17, 00:17 - Juancho: Isn't he (allegedly) perfect? If he was then how is this even remotely plausible?
17/07/17, 00:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The question is, how does he have so much computational power
17/07/17, 00:18 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
17/07/17, 00:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆😆
17/07/17, 00:27 - Janith: Quantum computing?
17/07/17, 00:28 - Janith: Maybe the dude got himself a couple of server cpus and hooked them up in parallel
17/07/17, 00:28 - Janith: Or maybe our universe is just an mmorpg
17/07/17, 00:29 - Janith: Each person's thoughts are on their player's computer
17/07/17, 00:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Why the fuck is my character so drab then! I'm gonna hunt that bitch down
17/07/17, 00:30 - Janith: Well... Maybe the being that made you stuck with one of the preset characters 😆
17/07/17, 00:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That might get him killed someday 😠
17/07/17, 00:31 - Janith: I do that too sometimes though 😅
17/07/17, 00:31 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Jashhhhh the godslayer. I'm about to free everyone of their miserable lives
17/07/17, 00:31 - Janith: Haha technically though the God would be the devs
17/07/17, 00:32 - Janith: Though it is fun to consider things like that. We are characters in an mmorpg created in a higher level universe and the mmorpgs we play could be lower level universes
17/07/17, 00:33 - Janith: With the whole thing going on and on in both directions to infinity
17/07/17, 00:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well
17/07/17, 00:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Nothing 😬
17/07/17, 00:40 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: but why did god "give" us free will then?
17/07/17, 00:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What if we're functioning as per a bigger algorithm?
17/07/17, 00:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: lol that sounds insane. Excuse me, sleep deprivation
17/07/17, 00:42 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: brains in vats

17/07/17, 00:44 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
17/07/17, 00:45 - Juancho: Rather intriguing articlr
17/07/17, 00:45 - Juancho: Atricle*
17/07/17, 00:45 - Juancho: Article*
17/07/17, 00:45 - Janith: We don't actually have free will
17/07/17, 00:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lmao the thinker must be drunk
17/07/17, 00:45 - Janith: That's just wishful thinking
17/07/17, 00:46 - Janith: Quite a few experiments have proven that our will is heavily affected by the situations, dispositions and people in different scenarios
17/07/17, 00:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: "A brain in the vat is walking"
17/07/17, 00:47 - Juancho: Goes without saying
17/07/17, 00:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How ridiculous 😆
17/07/17, 00:47 - Janith: I agree with the argument from biology
17/07/17, 00:47 - Janith: Assuming we don't pull a brain out from a guy and throw it in a vat
17/07/17, 00:48 - Janith: If we did I think I can safely assume the consciousness stored in that brain would go mad in under 15 minutes
17/07/17, 00:51 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: but do these experiments include that small element called consciousness?
17/07/17, 00:51 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The brain is said to experience things so I guess it's conscious
17/07/17, 00:51 - Janith: They involve actual people
17/07/17, 00:52 - Janith removeu ‪+1 (418) 409-7540‬
17/07/17, 00:53 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: what I mean is that will is also affected by our liberty to choose or take responsibility for actions
17/07/17, 00:53 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: but how could that be proven
17/07/17, 00:54 - Janith: The thing is, most of the time the perceived lack of choice in people overrides the ability to choose
17/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: So many outside forces can mess with the will of the individual
17/07/17, 00:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Will is basically an inclination to do some particular thing. So obviously one does it only when he chooses to
17/07/17, 00:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think it's proven by definition
17/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: Not completely true.
17/07/17, 00:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Where did I go wrong?
17/07/17, 00:56 - Janith: Sometimes social pressures and other things can get people to do things they normally wouldn't
17/07/17, 00:56 - Janith: Like in the "third wave" experiment
17/07/17, 00:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No. There's still a choice there. Just that no can have heavy consequences but the person still has a choice
17/07/17, 00:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No one can make you do anything if you're not willing to do it
17/07/17, 00:57 - Janith: Indeed choice is always there but the proportion of individuals that see it is statistically insignificant
17/07/17, 00:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I once said this to someone, and he told me that if someone shoved a finger down my throat, I'd puke without will
17/07/17, 00:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Like what a fucking gross and ridiculous argument
17/07/17, 00:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 🤣🤣
17/07/17, 00:58 - Janith: I doubt that. Studies into situational forces have proven otherwise
17/07/17, 00:59 - Janith: That's a reflex. Doesn't apply to this argument
17/07/17, 00:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Situations just establish the pros and cons of choosing yes or no
17/07/17, 00:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But you still have a choice
17/07/17, 01:00 - Janith: Technically yes. But just having a choice isn't evidence of free will
17/07/17, 01:00 - Janith: The evidence is clear that most act as though they don't have any choice
17/07/17, 01:00 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: that idiot was ignoring the obvious fact that there are things that are done involuntarily like your heart pumping blood or thoughts popping into your brain
17/07/17, 01:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's their individual lack of perception
17/07/17, 01:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No one can help them
17/07/17, 01:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's their own downfall. There's still a choice they can't see
17/07/17, 01:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Interesting fellows in the world
17/07/17, 01:01 - Janith: The "themćin this situation is over 80% of participants
17/07/17, 01:01 - Janith: *them
17/07/17, 01:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well it could be 100% of the participants and I'd still say the same
17/07/17, 01:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Just because they don't realise they have a choice doesn't mean they don't
17/07/17, 01:02 - Janith: That's true but that's no argument for free will
17/07/17, 01:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I know it doesn't amount to an individual argument
17/07/17, 01:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But I'm just stating why I don't agree with your POV
17/07/17, 01:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I mean I'm still no one to contemplate this
17/07/17, 01:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But as far as my sight goes, it does make sense
17/07/17, 01:03 - Janith: Ah okay. Though I don't quite understand what you're getting at 😅
17/07/17, 01:04 - Juancho: Me neither
17/07/17, 01:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sure tell me what you don't understand. I'll elaborate
17/07/17, 01:04 - Janith: Are you saying that merely having a choice is can be taken as an argument for free will?
17/07/17, 01:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think I am
17/07/17, 01:05 - Juancho: Well, it is, isn't it?
17/07/17, 01:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whenever there are two alternatives, a person is bound to be inclined to one. That's will surely
17/07/17, 01:06 - Janith: I might have to refresh my definition of free will then
17/07/17, 01:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You understood me now right?
17/07/17, 01:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @94754191589
17/07/17, 01:08 - Janith: Yeah I think so. I'm guessing I'm working with an outdated definition
17/07/17, 01:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Alright
17/07/17, 01:11 - Janith: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/
17/07/17, 01:11 - Janith: Fun read
17/07/17, 01:12 - Janith: I'm guessing I should consider freedom of will and freedom of action as separate. It seems to be the wise course of action
17/07/17, 01:13 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
17/07/17, 01:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: "But the significance of free will is not exhausted by its connection to moral responsibility."
17/07/17, 01:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The article states my exact point
17/07/17, 01:25 - Juancho: Can someone bring me up to speed on CPUs
17/07/17, 01:25 - Juancho: I'm custom building my rig
17/07/17, 01:25 - Juancho: But it's been a while since I researched about hardware
17/07/17, 01:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not your person for that 😬
17/07/17, 01:25 - Juancho: Any new processors by intel?
17/07/17, 01:26 - Juancho: Too bad
17/07/17, 01:29 - Janith: i9
17/07/17, 01:29 - Janith: Monster
17/07/17, 01:29 - Janith: I recommend an amd build though
17/07/17, 01:29 - Janith: Ryzen and Vega are much better for the money
17/07/17, 01:30 - Janith: Yeah I saw that. I get your point now
17/07/17, 01:30 - Janith: 😊
17/07/17, 01:30 - Juancho: These are my specs as of now: 16 gigs of ddr4 ram, MSI Z270 PC MATE (Intel Z270 Chipset), 750watt EVGA power supply, 2tb hard drove, 240gb ssd, GTX 1060
17/07/17, 01:30 - Juancho: Undecided on the CPU thougj
17/07/17, 01:30 - Juancho: How many cores?
17/07/17, 01:31 - Janith: Nice. Going high end
17/07/17, 01:31 - Juancho: Intel Core i7-7700
17/07/17, 01:31 - Juancho: I was going to go with i5 but
17/07/17, 01:31 - Janith: 10 or 12
17/07/17, 01:31 - Janith: I can't remember
17/07/17, 01:32 - Juancho: I think 10
17/07/17, 01:32 - Juancho: It's for gaming
17/07/17, 01:32 - Janith: i7 is good
17/07/17, 01:32 - Janith: It's overkill for gaming
17/07/17, 01:32 - Juancho: Ik
17/07/17, 01:32 - Janith: Consoles can't keep up so no games for a 10 core
17/07/17, 01:32 - Juancho: I'm going to overclock it
17/07/17, 01:33 - Juancho: Up till 4.20 ghz
17/07/17, 01:33 - Juancho: Hahahahah. Console.
17/07/17, 01:33 - Juancho: Their the laughing stock of the gaming community.
17/07/17, 01:34 - Juancho: I was also taking a look at graphics cards
17/07/17, 01:34 - Janith: Honestly why bother yet? 😅
17/07/17, 01:34 - Juancho: I might need it
17/07/17, 01:34 - Janith: Now now. Play nice 😂
17/07/17, 01:35 - Juancho: I do it for the fun
17/07/17, 01:35 - Juancho: Of it
17/07/17, 01:35 - Juancho: Hahahaha
17/07/17, 01:35 - Janith: Planning on doing some computing heavy tasks?
17/07/17, 01:35 - Juancho: As a matter of fact I am.
17/07/17, 01:35 - Janith: Tbh dude right now I think amd is the best way to go
17/07/17, 01:36 - Juancho: There's this one graphics card I really like. The Asus ROG strixs gtx 1060
17/07/17, 01:36 - Juancho: 6gv
17/07/17, 01:36 - Juancho: Gb*
17/07/17, 01:36 - Janith: The performance difference between an i7 and a high end ryzen in gaming is negligible
17/07/17, 01:37 - Janith: Ryzen has more cores so better for parallel processing
17/07/17, 01:37 - Janith: And unless you're in a hurry I recommend waiting a bit for the Vega gpus to hit the market
17/07/17, 01:37 - Juancho: Not sure. AMD sucks. They advertise their CPUs as elite hardware because they have 16 cores when their CPUs are shit. 😂😂😂
17/07/17, 01:37 - Janith: How so?
17/07/17, 01:38 - Juancho: Ohh yeah. That's going to be interesting.
17/07/17, 01:38 - Janith: Amd has lower per-core performance but as a whole they're pretty solid
17/07/17, 01:38 - Juancho: They advertise on cores when cores don't mean performance.
17/07/17, 01:38 - Juancho: True
17/07/17, 01:39 - Janith: Depends on the task. Amd is great for computations
17/07/17, 01:39 - Janith: Where cores = performance
17/07/17, 01:39 - Juancho: Not sure if I should get optical drive.
17/07/17, 01:39 - Janith: Intel only has the edge in gaming because of the 4 core limitation of consoles
17/07/17, 01:40 - Janith: Don't bother. You can always get a USB optical drive later
17/07/17, 01:40 - Janith: I'm stick with a gtx 960m though right now :(
17/07/17, 01:40 - Janith: *stuck
17/07/17, 01:41 - Juancho: Fucking consoles. What a scam.
17/07/17, 01:41 - Janith: Can't deny they have their benefits
17/07/17, 01:41 - Juancho: It's the same thing as the 1060. It's just that 1060 performs a tat better.
17/07/17, 01:41 - Janith: Especially for the more casual gamer
17/07/17, 01:42 - Juancho: They only thing they have are exclusives.
17/07/17, 01:42 - Juancho: I have a PS4 as well.
17/07/17, 01:42 - Janith: Err... No its not. Pascal performs around 100% better than Maxwell
17/07/17, 01:42 - Juancho: I just finished shadow of mordor and horizon zero dawn.
17/07/17, 01:43 - Janith: I don't consider exclusives a valid argument. They're only exclusives cause business
17/07/17, 01:43 - Janith: PCs cab easily run them
17/07/17, 01:43 - Juancho: Are there emulators for these games?
17/07/17, 01:43 - Janith: I was talking more about the fact that nearly anyone can play on a console
17/07/17, 01:43 - Juancho: Ohh
17/07/17, 01:44 - Janith: PC tends to be more complicated 😂
17/07/17, 01:44 - Janith: What with the graphics settings, crashes, mods and other stuff
17/07/17, 01:44 - Juancho: The only reason i've kept my console is because I, from time to time, like to play with my friends.
17/07/17, 01:45 - Janith: Not the new generation consoles
17/07/17, 01:45 - Janith: Also only cause copyright reasons
17/07/17, 01:45 - Juancho: PS4s running GTA at 20-30 fps, console gamers claiming optimal performance 😂😂😂
17/07/17, 01:45 - Janith: Guess I have no reason to have a console
17/07/17, 01:46 - Janith: Honestly I don't get why some console gamers try to say consoles are superior
17/07/17, 01:46 - Juancho: They lose the argument every fucking time.
17/07/17, 01:47 - Janith: I mean yes under certain specific circumstances they're preferable over a gaming rig but a pc is far superior
17/07/17, 01:47 - Juancho: Hey
17/07/17, 01:47 - Janith: Even my laptop is on par with consoles 😂
17/07/17, 01:47 - Juancho: My friend is so fucking stupid
17/07/17, 01:47 - Juancho: He was changing from console to pc
17/07/17, 01:48 - Juancho: He was reluctant to getting a desktop
17/07/17, 01:48 - Janith: Why?
17/07/17, 01:48 - Juancho: So them he went on a quest for gaming laptops
17/07/17, 01:48 - Janith: Exactly what I did 😂
17/07/17, 01:48 - Juancho: Not sure. He said they were 'not his thing'.
17/07/17, 01:49 - Janith: Though in my case I'm heading for uni in a couple of months so I need the portability
17/07/17, 01:49 - Juancho: And the fucking asshole, comes up to me and told me he was buying a fucking 13inch dell
17/07/17, 01:49 - Juancho: With shit specs and overpriced af
17/07/17, 01:49 - Juancho: So then I had to lecture him on hardware.
17/07/17, 01:49 - Janith: Sure I sacrifice a lot of power but I'd rather play on shitty resolutions than not play at all 😅
17/07/17, 01:50 - Janith: Personally I prefer Asus for gaming
17/07/17, 01:50 - Juancho: Anyways, he bought an ASUS.
17/07/17, 01:50 - Juancho: We're playing overwatch
17/07/17, 01:50 - Janith: ROG?
17/07/17, 01:50 - Juancho: Yeah
17/07/17, 01:50 - Janith: Is overwatch as addictive as they say?
17/07/17, 01:51 - Janith: I've been avoiding it cause of that 😂
17/07/17, 01:51 - Juancho: His computer is capable of playing it at 1080p 60-90 fps
17/07/17, 01:51 - Juancho: Not for me at least.
17/07/17, 01:51 - Janith: Sweet. What are his specs ml
17/07/17, 01:51 - Janith: *?
17/07/17, 01:51 - Juancho: And the fucking asshole plays it at the lowest settings
17/07/17, 01:51 - Janith: I've been playing paladins (free overwatch basically)
17/07/17, 01:51 - Juancho: Can't recall but they were decent.
17/07/17, 01:52 - Juancho: Guess what his reasons were.
17/07/17, 01:52 - Janith: Doesn't want to overheat the gpu?
17/07/17, 01:52 - Juancho: Yeah right
17/07/17, 01:52 - Juancho: Like if that guy had a sense of how they work
17/07/17, 01:52 - Janith: If it's a rog then cooling isn't a problem
17/07/17, 01:53 - Janith: Mine runs at 80 degrees!
17/07/17, 01:53 - Juancho: These were his reasons: I can see 'spots' that no one else can and other players can't see me
17/07/17, 01:53 - Janith: 90-94 is the red zone for Nvidia gpus
17/07/17, 01:54 - Juancho: Wow, 80. That's burn my fucking legs.
17/07/17, 01:54 - Janith: Unless his Internet connection sucks too I don't see that happening
17/07/17, 01:54 - Juancho: He's a damn moron
17/07/17, 01:54 - Janith: Oh I keep it on a table.
17/07/17, 01:54 - Juancho: How is that even logical
17/07/17, 01:54 - Janith: Gaming with an 80 degree laptop on your lap is less than fun 😅😂
17/07/17, 01:54 - Juancho: Ohh, i use my laptop to play in my bed.
17/07/17, 01:55 - Janith: Careful you don't block the vents
17/07/17, 01:55 - Juancho: I also had this teacher
17/07/17, 01:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Try keeping books beneath the laptop
17/07/17, 01:56 - Juancho: He was a Alienware fanboy
17/07/17, 01:56 - Juancho: Hahahahaha
17/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: I use a mouse and keyboard externally so it's basically a desktop now 😂
17/07/17, 01:56 - Juancho: That guy
17/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: Ah Alienware
17/07/17, 01:56 - Juancho: The macs of pcs.
17/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: We all thought it was the shit at one point
17/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: Then we got into pc gaming 😂
17/07/17, 01:56 - Juancho: He said that Alienware was superior to all other brands
17/07/17, 01:57 - Juancho: He bought an area 51
17/07/17, 01:57 - Janith: Superior goes to the Acer predator 21x
17/07/17, 01:57 - Juancho: How fucking stupid do you have to be to buy that?
17/07/17, 01:57 - Juancho: I have the acer predator
17/07/17, 01:57 - Juancho: But the 15
17/07/17, 01:57 - Janith: Haven't even heard of that model
17/07/17, 01:58 - Janith: What are the specs?
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: It's sexy looking
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: Same as my desktop
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: Except for the obvious things
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: Such as motherboard
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: And power supply
17/07/17, 01:58 - Janith: My parents are ridiculously stingy when I ask them for anything gaming related
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: It has an IPS panel
17/07/17, 01:58 - Juancho: Mine too.
17/07/17, 01:59 - Janith: So how did you manage to afford that kind of hardware? M :O
17/07/17, 01:59 - Juancho: Just make logical arguments they can't refute
17/07/17, 01:59 - Juancho: And address myths
17/07/17, 01:59 - Juancho: Related to gaming
17/07/17, 02:00 - Janith: Try having an INFP mother and as ISxJ father -_-
17/07/17, 02:00 - Juancho: And pesky lies made up by other parents
17/07/17, 02:00 - Juancho: With scientific evidence
17/07/17, 02:00 - Juancho: Huh
17/07/17, 02:01 - Juancho: How does that work out for you?
17/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: It doesn't 😂
17/07/17, 02:01 - Juancho: Luckily I have INTJ and INTP
17/07/17, 02:01 - Juancho: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
17/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: The only reason I have my laptop now is because I sorta tricked and guilt tripped my parents 😂
17/07/17, 02:02 - Juancho: When what I say is completely logical, their hands are tied.
17/07/17, 02:02 - Juancho: Hahahahahha
17/07/17, 02:02 - Janith: Playing with their expectations, and their sense of honesty for 3 years to get this 😂
17/07/17, 02:02 - Juancho: Wait
17/07/17, 02:03 - Juancho: How old are you?
17/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: 19
17/07/17, 02:03 - Juancho: Ohh
17/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: I was aiming at my current laptop before the current gpu generation came out!
17/07/17, 02:03 - Juancho: I was under the impression that you were a bit younger.
17/07/17, 02:04 - Janith: I wish I was a bit older
17/07/17, 02:04 - Juancho: You and me both buddy
17/07/17, 02:04 - Janith: More than gaming I just want to get some research done
17/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: You wouldn't believe how many games I played with crap systems
17/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: 😂😂
17/07/17, 02:05 - Juancho: Me too. I'm not wired for being dependant.
17/07/17, 02:05 - Juancho: Triple A games?
17/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: And indie
17/07/17, 02:06 - Juancho: Indie games
17/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Mostly AAA
17/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Just got into indie games last year
17/07/17, 02:06 - Juancho: Are you getting the new call of duty
17/07/17, 02:07 - Janith: Waiting for the reviews
17/07/17, 02:07 - Juancho: I usually don't buy that game
17/07/17, 02:07 - Janith: If it's anything like the other color swapped pieces of garbage then no thanks 😅
17/07/17, 02:07 - Juancho: But didi you see the gameplay on that game
17/07/17, 02:07 - Janith: But this looks promising

17/07/17, 07:33 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: That box has infinitely more opportunities to offer
17/07/17, 09:11 - Lulu: Most games are addicting to me, I don't play cuz I know they'll consume my life
17/07/17, 09:12 - Lulu: I can only do ones with a definite end lol
17/07/17, 09:12 - Janith: If a game doesn't have a definite goal I get bored most of the time so I don't have that problem thankfully 😅
17/07/17, 09:13 - Lulu: I mean goals and ends are different tho
17/07/17, 09:13 - Janith: What's your favorite game so far Lulu?
17/07/17, 09:13 - Lulu: There are multiple goals in some games 😭
17/07/17, 09:14 - Lulu: I have no strong opinions for anything
17/07/17, 09:14 - Janith: Definitely. I can deal with an endless game with goals but not a game without any goals
17/07/17, 09:14 - Janith: True but there's gotta be a game you enjoyed more than most 😉
17/07/17, 09:14 - Lulu: I can deal, but I'll play 24/7 and let it consume my life
17/07/17, 09:15 - Lulu: I haven't really played many TBH, I've been meaning to get more on steam when I get money lol
17/07/17, 09:15 - Lulu: I like Sims I guess
17/07/17, 09:15 - Lulu: Dunno of that counts
17/07/17, 09:15 - Lulu: Lmai
17/07/17, 09:15 - Lulu: Lmao
17/07/17, 09:16 - Janith: I usually make sure I play late in the day. At least that way I have some control over the amount of time that passes ingame
17/07/17, 09:16 - Janith: Good question actually. It would depend on your definition of a game though
17/07/17, 09:17 - Lulu: If I start that type of game it's with my friends and in the summer usually
17/07/17, 09:17 - Lulu: And we are all still young so little responsibility
17/07/17, 09:17 - Lulu: We will play til dawb
17/07/17, 09:17 - Lulu: Go to sleep
17/07/17, 09:18 - Lulu: Then wake up and keep playib
17/07/17, 09:18 - Lulu: Playing*
17/07/17, 09:18 - Janith: If you count a game as something with victory and defeat conditions then I'm not sure the Sims are valid
17/07/17, 09:18 - Janith: Aren't you 18?😆
17/07/17, 09:18 - Lulu: TBH I count anything that is a game as a game lol
17/07/17, 09:18 - Lulu: I just turned 18 lol
17/07/17, 09:18 - Lulu: I just graduated high schiol
17/07/17, 09:19 - Lulu: I got  my first job in November this year
17/07/17, 09:19 - Lulu: So the summer before was free

17/07/17, 09:21 - Lulu: It's like dads
17/07/17, 09:21 - Lulu: Like ur a dad

17/07/17, 09:37 - Janith: @14843534493 do the dads come with customizable babies too?
17/07/17, 09:38 - Janith: I have more questions about that one game than I'm comfortable with actually
17/07/17, 10:22 - Lulu: The main dad has a daughter so no probably
17/07/17, 10:27 - Aaron: I agree that I do tend to care about others, a great deal even. They just don't return the feeling in the same magnitude that I'm expressing it towards them so I choose not to care about them in such huge amounts because the balance is never equal. If they can't or won't return it, aware of it or not, by keeping up the unreturned amount of care for someone just drains me too much. I can't handle it.
17/07/17, 10:28 - Aaron: Alot of new names here, welcome!
17/07/17, 10:50 - Maureen: I can spend days of playing Sims 🤗
17/07/17, 10:50 - Maureen: yeah, I know that feeling
17/07/17, 11:13 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm on vacation and I just opened a textbook, trying to read that shit. I think I've studied enough for today...

17/07/17, 16:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Whats it like to be an Intp in his 30s?
17/07/17, 16:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @447903370497
17/07/17, 16:43 - Tel: Only just in my 30s - like, months! Plus, I'm still an immature schmuck ;)
17/07/17, 16:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Does anything change/improve?
17/07/17, 16:43 - Tel: Hm, seriously, though - it's OK, and I blame that on having an ok job which allows me to be creative and have others help implement my ideas
17/07/17, 16:45 - Tel: I also blame it in acknowledging and accepting that I won't find it easy to be accepted in society because I think differently. Also, I'm seemingly impossible to manage
17/07/17, 16:45 - Tel: Hm, change.. Through mbti I've developed my self and social awareness, becoming more resilient in the process.. That's prob the most important thing for me
17/07/17, 16:46 - Tel: Did you have anything specific in mind?
17/07/17, 16:47 - Tel: Btw, that awareness piece - did wonders for giving me the confidence in my own ideas and rational thought, even when everyone else was constantly looking at me like 😳
17/07/17, 16:47 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Did that ever make you feel stupid? The way people respond to your ideas? Or merely incomprehensible?
17/07/17, 16:48 - Tel: Dno if that helps.. Happy to answer other questions, though others might have better answers too, even if not as old (am I actually the oldest here?)
17/07/17, 16:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Your answers are very insightful
17/07/17, 16:48 - Tel: Hm, stupid - I bit maybe. Moreso I felt ignored
17/07/17, 16:48 - Tel: A*
17/07/17, 16:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I appreciate the effort!
17/07/17, 16:48 - Tel: And it annoyed me immensely that others didn't understand
17/07/17, 16:49 - Tel: Haha np
17/07/17, 16:50 - Tel: I try to overcome that annoyance by learning re mbti and the current part of that journey involves understanding what makes others tick, on a dominant type by dominant type basis (hence currently working to be an mbti practitioner)
17/07/17, 16:50 - Tel: Doesn't always work. Currently having a huge fight with my ISTJ manager and ill be leaving my job shortly as a result
17/07/17, 16:51 - Tel: I find it extremely hard to back down to poor logic. I do not play politics. Can't, perhaps.
17/07/17, 16:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m curious about the origin of these set of personalities
17/07/17, 16:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You can get a clear image of a persons personality by asking yes or no questions
17/07/17, 16:53 - Tel: Well, a clear guess
17/07/17, 16:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Like why are there different personalities
17/07/17, 16:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: How does it start and why
17/07/17, 16:53 - Tel: Which may be wrong. 30% of the time, the proper OPP mbti q'aire is wrong on one dichotomy
17/07/17, 16:53 - Tel: Hm, that's a good q. Worth a research thesis perhaps
17/07/17, 16:54 - Tel: That's when we need a good ISTJ on the team to do the hard graft, whilst we ideate..:p
17/07/17, 16:55 - Tel: How old are you, Tom? And how do you experience being an INTP?
17/07/17, 16:55 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m 19 and it sucks
17/07/17, 16:55 - Tel: Interested in the reverse temporal telescope.. So to scope
17/07/17, 16:55 - Tel: Speak*, though the pun works nicer
17/07/17, 16:56 - Maureen: Hey, @352621714571 we're neighbours 😂
17/07/17, 16:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Germany?

17/07/17, 16:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah
17/07/17, 16:57 - Tel: Why does it suck?
17/07/17, 16:57 - Maureen: I'm a little more south, near Stuttgart
17/07/17, 17:00 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you re an Intp with an average IQ which I guess I have, you re basically useless in life except for curiosity(though intp lazyness works against it at the same time)
17/07/17, 17:01 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah and that combined with not being able to be natural around other people, generally being awkward and too soft with people
17/07/17, 17:01 - Maureen: useless is pretty accurate
17/07/17, 17:01 - Maureen: I always go with strange and weird
17/07/17, 17:02 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah but that can be intepreted in a good way still 😅
17/07/17, 17:02 - Maureen: apparently telling people "I know I'm strange and it's okay" doesn't seem as confident as you think it is
17/07/17, 17:03 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Maureen how do you know we re neighbours? You know any +352 numbers?
17/07/17, 17:03 - Maureen: Yes, but also Wikipedia List in my tabs 😂
17/07/17, 17:03 - Maureen: and it makes you even stranger 🙈
17/07/17, 17:05 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You ve got to stay tough on the outside when meeting new people, they will eventually figure out that you re different ,no need to tell them 😂
17/07/17, 17:06 - Maureen: I don't tell new people, more people I know and who are not very close to me (so no friends but "Bekannte")
17/07/17, 17:07 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Familiar people
17/07/17, 17:07 - Maureen: thanks 🙏🏻

18/07/17, 08:26 - Imeldaroswara: Anyone ever read Sophie's World? I read it in high school....and it quite good in making me question my own existence. Which is not very good considering I was still a teenager when I read that book.
18/07/17, 08:27 - Tel: Question your own existence how?
18/07/17, 08:27 - Imeldaroswara: You need to find out by your own. I won't provide any spoiler. LOL...
18/07/17, 08:30 - Tel: Haha fair enough. Perhaps I'll read it when I get a chance.
18/07/17, 08:30 - Imeldaroswara: If you don't like someone, gifting them that book will be very exhilarating. There will be only 2 outcomes, either they will hate you for life or they will turn to be your best friend. It's like philosophical questions waived in a fiction. And the end is.....just.... <I can't find a word due to conflicting thoughts and emotions>
18/07/17, 08:30 - Tel: Ps I might not get around to it for a v long time, or ever.. So happy for you to spoil it - I'll prob forget whilst I'm reading it anyway ;)
18/07/17, 08:31 - Tel: Hm intriguing
18/07/17, 08:32 - Imeldaroswara: Ahhh..sherlock holmes... I love the series...

18/07/17, 08:34 - Imeldaroswara: At Juan....are you planning to do something naughty...naughty....?
18/07/17, 08:35 - Imeldaroswara: Just hunt for the free ebooks... Hahaha...

18/07/17, 08:38 - Imeldaroswara: Usually..I will get the "free" ebook first..read it..and if I deemed it worthy for my collection then I will buy the "original" ebook and the physical book. 😁
18/07/17, 08:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I already did 😂😂

18/07/17, 09:01 - Imeldaroswara: No problemo..
18/07/17, 09:53 - Arne: Hmm this is cool, I thought about it a while ago, what kind of behavior is normal for the first child, second en third.

18/07/17, 10:03 - Imeldaroswara: *hyper-focus, often to the exclusion of all else*

Or known as *"death glare"*, it's everytime someone disturbed me when I am doing programming inside my head before writing the actual code.
18/07/17, 10:04 - Imeldaroswara: <Mídia omitida>
18/07/17, 10:07 - Tel: Lol, amazing Imelda.
18/07/17, 10:08 - Imeldaroswara: Non IT people will bot understand. 🤣
18/07/17, 10:08 - Imeldaroswara: *not
18/07/17, 10:09 - Tel: Well, I do and I'm not IT. though I do dabble in excel formulas and did a very little bit of coding when I was a kid
18/07/17, 10:09 - Tel: It's good at explaining the depth of thinking the INTP gets to, completely unknown to the outside world
18/07/17, 10:10 - Imeldaroswara: Hehehe... I think INTP can relate with it as well.
18/07/17, 10:12 - Tel: Yup!
18/07/17, 10:13 - Imeldaroswara: Back to the Sherlock thing... I wonder if what he does is truly deductive skill...or is it merely a product of the author's imagination in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is merely plotting a story...then later on filling in the blanks for the hints to be picked up by Sherlock Holmes when he is doing his deduction...
Do you know what I mean...?
18/07/17, 10:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm eighteen in four days, but I still need to lie about my age to buy something online right now. This feels so strange, because I almost want to wait for some reason...
18/07/17, 10:18 - Imeldaroswara: So... let's say... I want to write a story of a violin player gets murdered in a forest, with no identity found on his body. Then I will try to know one violin player, take a note on his physical appearance...like callouses on fingers.. but then guitar player may also have callouses on his hand, so there should be a distinctive trait that differentiate a violin player and a guitar player. And voila...Sherlock knows what it is. Well...he plays violin too, so it makes sense.
18/07/17, 10:19 - Imeldaroswara: what things you want to buy?
18/07/17, 10:19 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: A game rated 18V

18/07/17, 15:28 - Juancho: @14843534493 Make a cat picture sub and add people
18/07/17, 15:29 - Juancho: But don't send cat pictures to this groups
18/07/17, 15:30 - Lulu: I don't send them every day
18/07/17, 15:30 - Lulu: That's like saying not to send memes
18/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: Ik but it's very very annoying
18/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: I made a meme sub
18/07/17, 15:30 - Lulu: A lot of people enjoy them tho
18/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: For the same reason
18/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: Well then add them to your sub
18/07/17, 15:31 - Lulu: That just seems a bit much when I only send like one or two pics maybe every 4 dayd
18/07/17, 15:32 - Lulu: Days*
18/07/17, 15:32 - Arne: Juan, there is something called "ignoring"?
18/07/17, 15:32 - Lulu: I admit sometimes I over do it but lol
18/07/17, 15:33 - Juancho: This group if purely for discussion on intellectual and social issues
18/07/17, 15:34 - Juancho: If you want to send pictures pf cats, dogs, possums; go right ahead
18/07/17, 15:34 - Janith: Ignore them if you don't like them man. Lulu's cat pictures per day ratio is within reasonable limits
18/07/17, 15:34 - Juancho: Just not in this group
18/07/17, 15:34 - Lulu: Who ever said such things tho lol, that's only an idea you had for the group
18/07/17, 15:35 - Lulu: I'm not saying its not
18/07/17, 15:35 - Lulu: But that doesn't mean cats are a big deal
18/07/17, 15:35 - Janith: I admit I'm not really a cat person either but it isn't bothering anyone
18/07/17, 15:35 - Lulu: Or any other casual talk like we sometimes have

18/07/17, 15:36 - Juancho: I loathe cats.
18/07/17, 15:36 - Lulu: It's just when I think my cat looks cute, I snap a pic wherever and I send it, it's spontaneous most of the time
18/07/17, 15:36 - Lulu: Lmao
18/07/17, 15:36 - Juancho: I can compromise but just send 1 cat picture
18/07/17, 15:36 - Janith: Bad experience with felines?

18/07/17, 15:37 - Lulu: I mean I don't want any daily limit man I'm just saying it shouldn't be a big deal, I understand a cat probably did something to you but u could have said that in the first place instead of being like that lol
18/07/17, 15:37 - Juancho: Don't want to be a hypocrite
18/07/17, 15:37 - Juancho: Hahahaha k

18/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: Ah. In that case, @14843534493 would it be possible to tone down the cat pics. Pretty please 😁
18/07/17, 15:39 - Lulu: Big doggo
18/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: Reminds me of shaggy and scooby 😂
18/07/17, 15:46 - Tel: I keep seeing me memes, etc, about INTPs being poor communicators.. I was, too, when young. Often fixated on the exact word for something and mind going blank in stressful situations (even when they weren't stressful at all!!). 

Just FYI - I'm a pretty decent communicator these days.. Verbally I mean. This has happened, I think, though increased understanding of others and a lot of learning from mistakes. Heuristics help a lot, as they give me formulas for conversations - very helpful things!! Such as, if my staff aren't performing and are refusing / unable to improve, I'll use the leadership continuum theory to show that I'm restricting their freedom and becoming more dictator-like.. It's in their hands as I'll have warned them beforehand, and they can easily reverse it by simply giving me a reasonable plan of action. Extremely transparent, but very effective
18/07/17, 15:47 - Tel: Totally!! Haha - Where's the Scoobie snacks...
18/07/17, 15:47 - Arne: I still have exactly that first problem rn. I hope, that it will get better/over when I get older
18/07/17, 15:49 - Janith: Same here. My guess is age and exposure to people help hone our ability to communicate
18/07/17, 15:49 - Tel: Yea it will, with focused learning in the area you want. Figure out what you want to achieve (Ti and Ne), then your Si can be seriously strong in feeding the Ti with the right detail. I was v fortunate in that I landed into an MSc that taught me a lot and helped me fulfil my Ti/Ne ambitions (or at least start to).
18/07/17, 15:50 - Tel: A good mentor helps perhaps.. Though I haven't found a decent one yet :/
18/07/17, 15:50 - Tel: 👍🏻
18/07/17, 15:52 - Tel: Knowledge and heuristics are prob the most useful items to me these days. It literally is how I communicate. I can still be absolutely crap in bars / clubs when chatting to girls, though - if anyone has any tips there, then feel free to add to the convo!!

19/07/17, 03:16 - Juancho: Fuckkkkk no
19/07/17, 03:16 - FABIO: physicists build thousands of experiments for it

19/07/17, 03:18 - Juancho: So essentially your saying this: building the LHC (which btw, designed by physicists) was harder than formulating the higgs field theory?

19/07/17, 03:18 - FABIO: or more important

19/07/17, 03:20 - FABIO: than discover...
19/07/17, 03:20 - FABIO: we prove

19/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: a lot
19/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: it
19/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: we build the tools
19/07/17, 03:22 - FABIO: we make their discoveryies possible
19/07/17, 03:23 - Juancho: I mean, no physicist no materials for you to work with.
19/07/17, 03:23 - FABIO: yeah

19/07/17, 03:23 - Juancho: It's a paradox
19/07/17, 03:23 - FABIO: but
19/07/17, 03:23 - FABIO: we need to argue
19/07/17, 03:23 - FABIO: hahahahah
19/07/17, 03:23 - Juancho: They are complementary
19/07/17, 03:23 - FABIO: just to mess
19/07/17, 03:25 - Juancho: Without engineers to build, theories are rendered useless (in the practical sense of course, without physicists, there would be no things for them to build with.
19/07/17, 03:25 - Juancho: Albert Einstein & Isaac Newton
19/07/17, 03:26 - Juancho: Without them satellites could not be put in orbit

19/07/17, 04:01 - Shaiju: I think  being a Scientist is the most rewarding as an INTP because it dealts with originality  and abstraction. Engineering is the applied science and formulating theoretical constructs are more original and rewarding akin to INTP temporament.  (From an Engineer who loves physics)

19/07/17, 07:46 - Juancho: Okay then.
19/07/17, 07:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬ entrou usando o link de convite deste grupo
19/07/17, 07:59 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I don't know when I exited this group. Probably my father took my phone and did it.
19/07/17, 08:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I felt a bit strange not getting any message from this group , so I guessed something was wrong
19/07/17, 08:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And he also deleted the previous messages
19/07/17, 08:06 - Didier: That's confirmed?But why?
19/07/17, 08:09 - Zahira: 🤔🤔😍
19/07/17, 08:13 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He is ISFJ. That's why.
19/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: Why did he do that though?Any idea
19/07/17, 08:13 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He does not appreciate the ideologies that emerge in the group
19/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Maybe
19/07/17, 08:14 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Also the 100+ messages each time
19/07/17, 08:14 - Didier: It seems rather odd to me though haha
19/07/17, 08:14 - Didier: Unless he is opposed to something
19/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He does not even like the fact that I am INTP
19/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And when I am in a group that is loaded with INTPs .....
19/07/17, 08:15 - Didier: He knows about mbti?
19/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I tried to explain him about it....
19/07/17, 08:15 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But
19/07/17, 08:16 - Didier: Same for my mom.She wasn't interested haha
19/07/17, 08:16 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He is ISFJ..... What could you expect from him"?😂😂
19/07/17, 08:16 - Didier: And I was right.She's an ESFJ
19/07/17, 08:16 - Didier: No surprise
19/07/17, 08:16 - Didier: She finally took the test
19/07/17, 08:16 - Didier: I noticed they need to be forced to take it
19/07/17, 08:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not only about interest...... If I suggest any creative or different idea.... He uses the word "INTP" as an abusive word for me
19/07/17, 08:18 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Told you earlier , didn't I ??😂
19/07/17, 08:23 - Imeldaroswara: I thought the question should be: "Why does he have access to your phone in the first place?"
19/07/17, 08:24 - Imeldaroswara: Isn't handphone fall under private stuff....? I swear if ever my dad get hold of my phone.. I will....#$?!*&
19/07/17, 08:26 - Janith: He's getting a worm in his laptop if he ever tries to snoop around my stuff 😈
19/07/17, 08:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: "children should have absolutely no privacy from parents. Regardless, parents having privacy from their children is perfectly fine. If you are doing something in private, it's definitely something wrong."......... Thus is what HE believes😒
19/07/17, 08:27 - Imeldaroswara: Wow... it's just... 🤦🏻‍♀
19/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, my phone doesn't even have any porn. But His phone , USBs, tab, laptop..... I assume there is porn everywhere
19/07/17, 08:28 - Janith: My father is like that too. He's gonna regret it down the road though
19/07/17, 08:29 - Didier: Oh god
19/07/17, 08:29 - Janith: Maybe you should create some shortcuts 😆
19/07/17, 08:29 - Didier: I noticed they r stubborn people who think they r very flexible
19/07/17, 08:29 - Imeldaroswara: Well....considering I am the one who bought my dad his latest handphone and our home theater... He should have known better to touch my stuff...ever..
19/07/17, 08:29 - Janith: 👆 perfect description of them actually
19/07/17, 08:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Also, he has an app called "whatstablet" from which he acceses my WhatsApp. Somehow, I managed it
19/07/17, 08:30 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: No better definition for my parents
19/07/17, 08:30 - Didier: Wait,u don't set a password?
19/07/17, 08:30 - Janith: Wait. How's that work?
19/07/17, 08:31 - Arne: Good idea
19/07/17, 08:31 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Dude I am not even allowed to set a password !!!

19/07/17, 08:31 - Arne: Do you have login password for your mobile at least?
19/07/17, 08:32 - Imeldaroswara: My condolences.....
Juat hang in there.
Once you have your own job.... parents can say little to none... 
That is true freedom, but then you will be burdened with bills...bills..bills.. 🤣
19/07/17, 08:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yup
19/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: I know that there r apps
19/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: Where u can hide other apps
19/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: U can hide ur whatsapp
19/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: Nvr tried tho
19/07/17, 08:32 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I had to fight to have privacy on my facebook and email passwords. Now what ???
19/07/17, 08:32 - Janith: How old are you @919554137104? 
I just have a secondary Sim which I use for privacy

19/07/17, 08:33 - Imeldaroswara: Aww...15... Whoaa...another october baby...
19/07/17, 08:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Till now I had assumed you are 22 or 25 !!!😆😆😆
19/07/17, 08:34 - Didier: Wow 😂
19/07/17, 08:34 - Arne: Oh, on the internet and stuff it is easier to over-rate my age
19/07/17, 08:35 - Janith: Any chance you'll be able to get a secondary number for another whatsapp account?
19/07/17, 08:35 - Didier: I'll turn 16 in dec
19/07/17, 08:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They believe that the head of the family is supposed to have all the passwords
19/07/17, 08:35 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yes
19/07/17, 08:36 - Arne: Was that "no" on this question, Faraz?
19/07/17, 08:36 - Didier: Maybe a friend's?
19/07/17, 08:36 - Didier: U can ask
19/07/17, 08:36 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But he will soon return back to makkah and I can regain my freedom
19/07/17, 08:37 - Janith: What's a makkah?
19/07/17, 08:37 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 08:37 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It's a city in KSA
19/07/17, 08:37 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Search on google
19/07/17, 08:37 - Didier: Freedom...We lack this in our world
19/07/17, 08:37 - Didier: I always wanted freedom,peace...
19/07/17, 08:38 - Didier: How nice an ideal
19/07/17, 08:38 - Janith: The problem is that no one wants total freedom either
19/07/17, 08:38 - Arne: You can only have limited freedom, total freedom would destroy the world
19/07/17, 08:38 - Didier: Yeah it won't work
19/07/17, 08:38 - Didier: We need compromise
19/07/17, 08:39 - Didier: Plus,people r different
19/07/17, 08:39 - Didier: If they r all the same,it won't be a problem 😂
19/07/17, 08:39 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: At least we need a sensible leader for that in that case
19/07/17, 08:39 - Janith: The struggle to find a middle ground between freedom and order cause a lot of the chaos in society
19/07/17, 08:39 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Or self discipline
19/07/17, 08:39 - Didier: Yeah,too many diff personalities
19/07/17, 08:39 - Arne: Then we won't get any further. The world needs different people as much they need the same people
19/07/17, 08:39 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I believe in this
19/07/17, 08:40 - Janith: In reality there can't be a common  middle ground for such diverse personalities in a population
19/07/17, 08:40 - Janith: So there will never be true peace either I think
19/07/17, 08:40 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not that I have it !!😂
19/07/17, 08:40 - Didier: Yup
19/07/17, 08:40 - Arne: This is something we really need yeah
19/07/17, 08:40 - Didier: One that knows what decision should or should not be made
19/07/17, 08:40 - Arne: Same
19/07/17, 08:40 - Didier: We really need that
19/07/17, 08:40 - Didier: Go be a leader
19/07/17, 08:40 - Didier: INTPs
19/07/17, 08:41 - Didier: True 😂
19/07/17, 08:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Maybe ENTJ can be a good leader
19/07/17, 08:41 - Janith: Honestly though I think an INTP leader isn't too useful
19/07/17, 08:41 - Janith: 👆
19/07/17, 08:41 - Didier: That's y we need to join forces
19/07/17, 08:41 - Didier: INFJ,INFP,INTP
19/07/17, 08:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I mentioned this earlier too
19/07/17, 08:41 - Didier: Even an ENxx
19/07/17, 08:42 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I think intuitives , generally are the best
19/07/17, 08:42 - Didier: Janith my right hand man?
19/07/17, 08:42 - Janith: Totally 😁
19/07/17, 08:42 - Didier: SJs be the secretary
19/07/17, 08:43 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Didier, my left hand girl!!😂
19/07/17, 08:43 - Janith: Also spymaster😈
19/07/17, 08:43 - Didier: 😂
19/07/17, 08:43 - Didier: Sounds wrong tho
19/07/17, 08:43 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: S and J should not be together. They are worse
19/07/17, 08:44 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 08:44 - Didier: I just thought that they r good organisers
19/07/17, 08:44 - Didier: They will only help us to organise simple stuff
19/07/17, 08:44 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: The only ISTJ I ever liked was Hermione Granger
19/07/17, 08:44 - Janith: Orr... You know.. Just sent them into a pit 😅
19/07/17, 08:44 - Didier: I think ISTJs are fine
19/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: I dun really understand how they can be that self-disciplined tho
19/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: Odd. Thought she was INTP/J
19/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: Nope nope nope. They're fine at a distance
19/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 08:45 - Janith: Not up close
19/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: Nvr got close to them maybe that's why
19/07/17, 08:45 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah😂
19/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: Maybe they r better than ISFJs at least?
19/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: A bit more open
19/07/17, 08:46 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Definitely
19/07/17, 08:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That "T"
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: I wonder how it feels like to be their best friend though
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: They r the one who do best in sch
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: ISTJs
19/07/17, 08:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I tried to be once....
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: work*
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: Work best
19/07/17, 08:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: He is my enemy now
19/07/17, 08:47 - Didier: Wow 😂
19/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: Hmm
19/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: Gotta find out more
19/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: And rmb the girl I talked about?
19/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: I approached her asking her her interests
19/07/17, 08:48 - Janith: Which one?
19/07/17, 08:48 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: INFJ?
19/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: I'm not sure if she's an INTP though
19/07/17, 08:49 - Didier: Not close enough
19/07/17, 08:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: No. You never mentioned
19/07/17, 08:49 - Janith: Why not bring her into the group?
19/07/17, 08:49 - Didier: She said she has none 😂
19/07/17, 08:49 - Didier: Then we just walked off to class
19/07/17, 08:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Or maybe I didn't read the message
19/07/17, 08:49 - Janith: If she's intp she'd appreciate the stuff we talk about
19/07/17, 08:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Exactly
19/07/17, 08:49 - Didier: U probably weren't online maybe?
19/07/17, 08:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: S
19/07/17, 08:50 - Janith: Would be the first intp I've known to have said that
19/07/17, 08:50 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: .
19/07/17, 08:50 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: She isn't . Definitely not
19/07/17, 08:50 - Didier: The weird thing is
19/07/17, 08:50 - Didier: I believe everyone has interests?
19/07/17, 08:50 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Or maybe she was in a hurry
19/07/17, 08:50 - Didier: Maybe she just wasn't willing to tell me?
19/07/17, 08:51 - Arne: Most likeable
19/07/17, 08:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Didier , we are saying the same point in different words. This happened twice by now
19/07/17, 08:51 - Didier: U mean most likely?
19/07/17, 08:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This
19/07/17, 08:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: N this
19/07/17, 08:51 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: Right
19/07/17, 08:52 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I said this
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: I should observe her more
19/07/17, 08:52 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Then thsi
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: Sadly,I'm not attentive enough
19/07/17, 08:52 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: *this
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: Must remember
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: It didn't seem like she was in a hurry though
19/07/17, 08:52 - Didier: She always look very chill
19/07/17, 08:53 - Didier: Like I wonder what is she thinking
19/07/17, 08:53 - Didier: looks*
19/07/17, 08:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I recently realized that I am really good at analyzing MBTI
19/07/17, 08:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This happened several times
19/07/17, 08:53 - Didier: I can only analyze those close to me
19/07/17, 08:53 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I predicted accurate mbti of ppl
19/07/17, 08:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I also try to analyze mbti of ppl when i watch a movie
19/07/17, 08:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Or read a book
19/07/17, 08:54 - Didier: Haha wow the dedication
19/07/17, 08:54 - Didier: Is this an INTP thing?
19/07/17, 08:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I didn't see her directly.
19/07/17, 08:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It can be with anyone
19/07/17, 08:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But its an ENFP thing
19/07/17, 08:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Usually
19/07/17, 08:55 - Didier: Not ENFP
19/07/17, 08:55 - Didier: Cuz I know a lot of them haha
19/07/17, 08:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Introvert ?
19/07/17, 08:55 - Didier: But
19/07/17, 08:55 - Didier: She looks exceptionally chill?
19/07/17, 08:55 - Didier: In a daze too I think
19/07/17, 08:56 - Didier: Yes she's an introvert for sure
19/07/17, 08:56 - Didier: Compared to anyone else
19/07/17, 08:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: The biggest place I made mistake was while analyzing Arushi. I thought she was "T"
19/07/17, 08:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Cz she was intelligent
19/07/17, 08:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But, she is "F"
19/07/17, 08:57 - Didier: Arushi?
19/07/17, 08:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: The girl from my diary....
19/07/17, 08:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That's her name
19/07/17, 08:58 - Didier: Haha there can be stupid Fs as well as Ts and smart Fs and Ts
19/07/17, 08:58 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah agreed
19/07/17, 08:58 - Didier: Just that Fs have more stupid (no offence)
19/07/17, 08:58 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: You are F, but intelligent
19/07/17, 08:58 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Probably
19/07/17, 08:58 - Didier: How did u find out?
19/07/17, 08:59 - Didier: 😂
19/07/17, 08:59 - Arne: INTPs always trying to get as much possibilities open as they can
19/07/17, 09:00 - Didier: How do u spot an INTP in real life though
19/07/17, 09:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: My brother told me. She was originally the one who told him about MBTI . And he was the one who told me about MBTI
19/07/17, 09:00 - Didier: Interesting story...
19/07/17, 09:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That's the thing !! You don't . It's not easy
19/07/17, 09:01 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 09:01 - Didier: Maybs I should...Get the girl to do the test?
19/07/17, 09:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah
19/07/17, 09:01 - Didier: But she's just a classmate and we barely know each other
19/07/17, 09:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Definitely
19/07/17, 09:01 - Didier: How do I come off as not creepy
19/07/17, 09:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: You can start with generally explaining her about Carl Jung
19/07/17, 09:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: This will also set an image of you
19/07/17, 09:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😉
19/07/17, 09:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I did the same to many ppl
19/07/17, 09:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Even teachers
19/07/17, 09:02 - Didier: Wow
19/07/17, 09:03 - Arne: I am not the stereotype intp, I think. Because I'm with friends a very active guy. U am bad at convo's but that doesn't stop me
19/07/17, 09:03 - Didier: How do u get teachers to do it though?
19/07/17, 09:03 - Didier: I'm really curious 😂
19/07/17, 09:03 - Didier: About theirs
19/07/17, 09:03 - Didier: U mean u have extroverted friends and quite a few?
19/07/17, 09:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: During free periods when they interact with us, I start telling them about it
19/07/17, 09:04 - Didier: I think that's usually how introverts can blend in
19/07/17, 09:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Same with me
19/07/17, 09:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I have extroverrt frnds
19/07/17, 09:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And I mess with introvert friends😂
19/07/17, 09:05 - Didier: My extrovert friends r usually ENFPs 😂
19/07/17, 09:05 - Arne: Yes I have. And also another introvert in the group. But he is more introvert then me
19/07/17, 09:05 - Didier: Others r introverted
19/07/17, 09:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: All my extrovert friends are ENFP
19/07/17, 09:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not all
19/07/17, 09:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Mostly
19/07/17, 09:06 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: C'mon I barely have any friends
19/07/17, 09:06 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not more than 5-6
19/07/17, 09:06 - Didier: And I know this girl who is quite quiet.However,she's an extrovert.Extrovert does not necessarily mean loud and noisy,they just charge their energy by going out with people,meaning more outings with friends.
19/07/17, 09:06 - Didier: 😂
19/07/17, 09:07 - Didier: She's an ESFP
19/07/17, 09:07 - Arne: Same. But that other introvert guy is smarter then me. So
19/07/17, 09:07 - Didier: And I noticed that esfps r well-liked by everyone
19/07/17, 09:08 - Didier: What is his personality?Don't dismiss urself like that haha
19/07/17, 09:13 - Arne: Not sure tho
19/07/17, 09:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I once messed with an INTP friend (he is not too intelligent or witty) and told him that a "Faraz" came to me from the future and told me about the great discoveries I will do in the future. And that he(my friend) will be a multi-billionaire funding our research
19/07/17, 09:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And he actually believed me !!!
19/07/17, 09:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Why would you be lying to him ?😂
19/07/17, 09:18 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Just messing
19/07/17, 09:18 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I later told him the truth
19/07/17, 09:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Maybe he was just sarcastic
19/07/17, 09:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I know him for 2years. And I am one of his best friends. I know when he is what
19/07/17, 09:19 - Janith: How does one actually believe that kinda stuff without instantly remembering the paradoxes it would create
19/07/17, 09:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, I said he is not that witty
19/07/17, 09:20 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: My ISFJ mom actually introduced me to MBTI
19/07/17, 09:20 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Probably he didnt listen to the whole thing
19/07/17, 09:20 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😳that's new
19/07/17, 09:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not impossible though
19/07/17, 09:21 - Arne: Wow
19/07/17, 09:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is math related to science?
19/07/17, 09:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Is English related to this conversation ?
19/07/17, 09:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
19/07/17, 09:22 - Arne: It is, everything is connected with everything 😆
19/07/17, 09:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Katy Perry asked that question
19/07/17, 09:22 - Didier: Wow,talk about rare...
19/07/17, 09:22 - Arne: 🤣🤣
19/07/17, 09:22 - Didier: How?
19/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: She was always interested in personality tests, but the likes the DISC more
19/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Like to box things in, but not in a horrible way
19/07/17, 09:23 - Didier: Is she really an ISFJ 😂?If she is,she's a rare one
19/07/17, 09:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Request her to take test from a different website. And answer honestly
19/07/17, 09:23 - Didier: Is there a reason why she likes them?
19/07/17, 09:24 - Didier: Maybe it helped her a lot in her life or sth
19/07/17, 09:24 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Didier, again ??😂
19/07/17, 09:24 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: More like to box things in though
19/07/17, 09:24 - Didier: Haha
19/07/17, 09:24 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Not in a bad way, but yeah
19/07/17, 09:25 - Didier: When I showed xSFJs the test,they were like wtf does this mean
19/07/17, 09:26 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: She knew it from a young age though
19/07/17, 09:26 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Si I guess
19/07/17, 09:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: That explains
19/07/17, 09:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Exactly
19/07/17, 09:27 - Didier: Ask her what is the motivation behind her doing those tests
19/07/17, 09:27 - Didier: I would like to know
19/07/17, 09:27 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Maybe she was different back then...
19/07/17, 09:28 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I suspect the same for my father
19/07/17, 09:28 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: She said before to understand over people and why they act a certain way
19/07/17, 09:28 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: She said she got ESTJ on her first test
19/07/17, 09:28 - Didier: Hmm
19/07/17, 09:29 - Didier: Is it possible her past made her want to know this?
19/07/17, 09:30 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Yeah, actually. Born in Panama and moved to the US alone when young
19/07/17, 09:30 - Didier: And sorry but,who are u? 😂
19/07/17, 09:30 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: ?
19/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Does it say somewhere?
19/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Thought it did
19/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Anyone here who understands recursion? The programming language Prolog would be even better? 🤓
19/07/17, 09:31 - Didier: R u new?
19/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Kinda yeah
19/07/17, 09:31 - Didier: U
19/07/17, 09:31 - Didier: Okay haja
19/07/17, 09:31 - Didier: Welcome ;)
19/07/17, 09:32 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: Was watching and didn't speak for daus
19/07/17, 09:32 - Didier: Lurkers
19/07/17, 09:34 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
19/07/17, 09:34 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
19/07/17, 09:34 - Didier: right*
19/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: 😂 I can.I have magical powers
19/07/17, 09:36 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
19/07/17, 09:38 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
19/07/17, 09:38 - Arne: I have send this before. But it stays cool
19/07/17, 09:50 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: I dunno. She packs a lot of Si and Fe. really religious.
19/07/17, 09:51 - ‪+1 (334) 315-7973‬: But the only way to reach me is Ne, so she tries
19/07/17, 10:24 - Aaron: The bell has been struck for the second time. Twice now, five times more will it reverberate through our conciousness and with each coming will the vibration increase. Look for the blue moon, twin white eyes and a red sky and you will know the seventh is upon us.
19/07/17, 11:20 - Didier: https://youtu.be/4Qa6QXBxxWw
19/07/17, 11:29 - Didier: https://youtu.be/eAhfZUZiwSE
19/07/17, 11:33 - Imeldaroswara: I understand recursion but not Prolog...
19/07/17, 11:33 - Imeldaroswara: There are 2 basic requirements for a recursion...
19/07/17, 11:33 - Imeldaroswara: As long as you remember to set that 2, you'll be "safe".
19/07/17, 11:35 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Please tell me
19/07/17, 11:41 - Imeldaroswara: 1. Define the "counter".
It should be the object that will have different value everytime the recursive gets called. It's also the parameter that the recursive function needs.

2. Define the upper limit/lower limit.
Decide when your recursive needs to stop and what the default value it will return when it stop. Usually it will use if-else inside the recursive function.
19/07/17, 12:08 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Thanks I will compare it to my study material!
19/07/17, 14:21 - Tel: Any mbti type can be a good leader.. And any can be bad.
19/07/17, 14:22 - Janith: Indeed but I was making a general statement
19/07/17, 14:22 - Tel: Yes and no.. SJ =b extremely common. Also, if you = S, you're more likely to be a J statistically. Same with N and P
19/07/17, 14:22 - Janith: Whether or not someone is a good leader depends on them
19/07/17, 14:23 - Janith: But considering types in general, there are other types that can serve a leader role better
19/07/17, 14:24 - Maureen: I'd say an INTP is a great leader
19/07/17, 14:24 - Maureen: When they learned to organize their work
19/07/17, 14:24 - Janith: If an INTP has both the skill and the interest to pursue leadership then by all means they should
19/07/17, 14:24 - Tel: I have an "aware" / semi developed ISTJ friend.. Really good. We work well with each other. I also have an "unaware" /poorly developed ISTJ manager. Seriously terrible dynamic. 

Perhaps it's more about thy relationship dynamics and type interplay.. Unsure. Haven't figured it out yet. I generally do not get on with SJ types though.
19/07/17, 14:25 - Janith: That's true but the same can be said for any type if they bypass their major flaws
19/07/17, 14:25 - Maureen: A leader has the overview. If an INTP plans things (or gets thrown into a task) they tend to be the leader
19/07/17, 14:26 - Tel: Hm, depends on definition of intelligence.. There isn't one single one. F is extremely valuable, sometimes more than T.. We can't presume we're better when we know we INTPs have our own weaknesses, can we?;)
19/07/17, 14:26 - Janith: True. Usually if there's no one who tries to take the lead then an INTP will probably step up
19/07/17, 14:28 - Maureen: As for me: I *need* to be the leader when nobody tries or cares (or worse: nobody does it right). I need to delegate, I need to know every step, and I need to get shit done
19/07/17, 14:28 - Tel: Or work well with SJ types ;)
19/07/17, 14:29 - Tel: They love to implement our ideas.. Unlocking that partnership is rewarding
19/07/17, 14:29 - Tel: That's a stereotypically into response I think. I'm the same
19/07/17, 14:30 - Tel: INTP*
19/07/17, 14:30 - Maureen: I also love to implement other ideas. just as much as others do mine
19/07/17, 14:30 - Tel: Implement how - consider every detail and actually carry out the actions required into it is fully effected?
19/07/17, 14:30 - Tel: Or..?
19/07/17, 14:31 - Tel: Until *
19/07/17, 14:31 - Maureen: exactly. with as much passion as if it was my own idea
19/07/17, 14:31 - Tel: Interesting
19/07/17, 14:31 - Tel: You're much better developed than I then 😝
19/07/17, 14:32 - Maureen: I'm both: a leader and a doer
19/07/17, 14:32 - Tel: Well, leaders are meant to do less and less the higher you get tbh
19/07/17, 14:32 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What
19/07/17, 14:32 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
19/07/17, 14:33 - Tel: If you're doing, is it because others can't do it to your high standard, or you actually like doing it?
19/07/17, 14:33 - Maureen: both 😂
19/07/17, 14:33 - Tel: Less and less as in actual implementation. The do more of coordination type work instead
19/07/17, 14:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah it s a lot of work
19/07/17, 14:34 - Tel: Yup, just a different type
19/07/17, 14:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But not work that anyone can do
19/07/17, 14:35 - Tel: Hm, I'd argue that anyone with the right training and awareness levels could be fairly good at it. Certainly, there are a lot of ppl that call themselves leaders that are anything but..
19/07/17, 14:36 - Tel: Hopefully a good moral stance / vision would go hand in hand with the training and awareness..
19/07/17, 14:36 - Maureen: my boss is a doer and can't handle the coordination and the high chair
19/07/17, 14:37 - Maureen: she has awesome visions but also has to do everything
19/07/17, 14:37 - Maureen: she's at work 24/7
19/07/17, 14:37 - Maureen: even on holidays
19/07/17, 14:37 - Tel: Ouch
19/07/17, 14:38 - Maureen: we say her home is fake, she actually lives at work 😂
19/07/17, 14:38 - Tel: Haha
19/07/17, 14:38 - Tel: That's not healthy though.. Everyone needs downtime
19/07/17, 14:38 - Maureen: a doer in a high chair...
19/07/17, 14:39 - Tel: Latest research shows that you're more productive working only 4 days a week. You accuracy get more done than if you worked 5.. So working more is likely to be detrimental..
19/07/17, 14:40 - Tel: I like the German way of working. I try to use it at my place.. If you're working more than your hours, you should be called in for a performance meeting - because you need help. Either you're being given too much to do, or you're not good at it
19/07/17, 14:40 - Maureen: what?
19/07/17, 14:40 - Tel: At least, I understand that to be the German way
19/07/17, 14:41 - Maureen: no way
19/07/17, 14:41 - Tel: Some places in Scandinavia do similar things.. Losing away desks at 5pm sharp
19/07/17, 14:41 - Tel: Locking*
19/07/17, 14:42 - Tel: Holland, sorry, re the desks -http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-36533743/how-dutch-designers-make-desks-disappear
19/07/17, 14:42 - Maureen: serious business is if you work more than 8 hours you get erased 30 min for break. so you're eighter forced to take a break or you get paid less because your employee (or the machines calculating your work) think you took a break
19/07/17, 14:43 - Maureen: but in any other businesses you get unpaid overhours
19/07/17, 14:43 - Maureen: sometimes you can take days off to equalize
19/07/17, 14:44 - Maureen: for teachers overtime taking days of is better than getting paid. those overtime payment is way less than their usual wage
19/07/17, 14:45 - Maureen: *In Germany
19/07/17, 14:46 - Maureen: some people won't do that because they think they can't leave work
19/07/17, 14:46 - Maureen: burn out syndrome is very real over here
19/07/17, 14:46 - Maureen: also other stress disorders
19/07/17, 14:46 - Tel: What industry is that Maureen?
19/07/17, 14:47 - Maureen: every. some more than others
19/07/17, 14:49 - Maureen: I love people thinking like that about Germany
19/07/17, 14:49 - Maureen: just like you say: sharp like a german train
19/07/17, 14:49 - Maureen: *have you ever waited for a german train?*
19/07/17, 14:51 - Tel: Have been to Germany a few times and don't remember a problem with the trains!
19/07/17, 14:51 - Tel: In what way?
19/07/17, 14:51 - Tel: As in, care to elaborate?
19/07/17, 14:53 - Maureen: I once waited 6 hours for a train home...
19/07/17, 14:54 - Arne: For me they where like 5 minutes to late
19/07/17, 14:54 - Maureen: they had a strike marathon 2015
19/07/17, 14:54 - Maureen: one week straight
19/07/17, 14:56 - Maureen: <Mídia omitida>
19/07/17, 14:56 - Maureen: riding with the train is constantly checking your app for a delay
19/07/17, 14:56 - Maureen: and hoping 10 min won't get longer
19/07/17, 14:57 - Maureen: or get into an annulment
19/07/17, 14:57 - Maureen: as in working morals
19/07/17, 14:58 - Maureen: everything on point. everything accurate (mostly true. not always)

20/07/17, 12:53 - Shaiju: Kk... There are sponsorship programs by other countries like Australia for research... You may explore that as well but most of them requires a degree.
20/07/17, 12:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Bachelor's ?
20/07/17, 13:02 - Shaiju: It depends on the offering. Some require diploma,others bachelor's or master's. One of my friend got a scholarship for mechatronics (offered by a  Singapore University)while doing his +2. Try googling,there are lot of opportunities to be explored. Hope you will find one that suits you... All the best :)
20/07/17, 17:14 - Amin: Chester died😭😭😭
20/07/17, 17:14 - Amin: God I loved him
20/07/17, 18:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He shouldn't have ended it this way
20/07/17, 18:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That man's life was glorious and epic. He was an inspiration to millions. But not anymore. He committed suicide. He made a huge blunder. I'm sure that man could've been better if he hadn't done this
20/07/17, 18:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: He hanged himself right?
20/07/17, 19:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Supposedly. It hasn't been mentioned clearly. It's just written "killed himself" in a lot of articles

20/07/17, 19:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm so disappointed
20/07/17, 19:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Such a wasteful end to such an epic life
20/07/17, 19:10 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: One of the reason could be that he was molested by an older man
20/07/17, 19:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep
20/07/17, 19:11 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He also had addiction issues

20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I want to try to create new Michael Jackson and Linkin Park songs with Googles AI 😂
20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You know, I posted on Facebook expressing how cowardly this action of his was, leaving millions of fans disappointed
20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And I'm getting a lot of flak for it now
20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Like real hostility
20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Shouldnt have done that 😂

20/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Wasn't this cowardly
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont care he was gay and was molested and addicted to drugs I kind of get that
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And fans are like any mob of people
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you re on the stage
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You look down on them
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Not homophobic

20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whatever his issues were, He inspired millions of people and committed suicide. He didn't set an appropriate example by ending his life
20/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But it could add so his personal issues
20/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Well
20/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sometimes you could've done a huge thing and end up ruining it all in the end
20/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: To me he s just another famous musician
20/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont get how they are supposed to inspire peoole

20/07/17, 19:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And she was whining about the laughing reacts on my post, accusing me for that. Like how do I have anything to do with them haha reacting
20/07/17, 19:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Marry her

20/07/17, 23:39 - Shaiju: We wear the mask that grins and lies, 

It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,— 

This debt we pay to human guile; 

With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, 

And mouth with myriad subtleties. 


Why should the world be over-wise, 

In counting all our tears and sighs? 

Nay, let them only see us, while 

       We wear the mask. 


We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries 

To thee from tortured souls arise. 

We sing, but oh the clay is vile 

Beneath our feet, and long the mile; 

But let the world dream otherwise, 

       We wear the mask!
20/07/17, 23:48 - Janith: I don't necessarily think it was cowardly. It could have been an act of cowardice but it could also be that he simply got tired of living
21/07/17, 00:12 - Imeldaroswara: I still think it's coward... It's not like mental/psychological issues are taboo in US, unlike in Asia. He had so many ways to help him getting better in whatever issues he had.... So disappointed.... I like Linkin Park... My brother poisoned me...but later on I find out...their songs help me when I do programming... It tune out the other voices....make me easier to focus... 😅
21/07/17, 00:14 - Janith: Haha I agree he could have searched for help but sometimes you just don't want to fight anymore.
21/07/17, 00:14 - Janith: I mean there's no way to know what was going through his head when he did it so no telling for sure
21/07/17, 00:15 - Janith: But I don't really suicide to be the coward's way out. I consider it a way to end living once you're done
21/07/17, 00:16 - Imeldaroswara: He can go to bora bora island...🏝🏝🏖
and live there for 1 year... Money should no longer be an issue for him right..?
21/07/17, 00:16 - Imeldaroswara: Or just any island in Pacific..
21/07/17, 00:17 - Imeldaroswara: Or go to bahama..
21/07/17, 00:17 - Janith: Haha true but no matter where you run you can't escape your mind
21/07/17, 00:18 - Janith: Eventually you get tired of fighting and decide that you're done. Maybe he felt that he had accomplished enough
21/07/17, 00:18 - Shaiju: Who are we to 'judge' what others life should be or should not be? It is personal choice and he might be having his own reasons for what he did and who are we to say otherwise. Moreover people over value life as it is something truly meaningful.
21/07/17, 00:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well that's what's being a fucking coward is
21/07/17, 00:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They don't want to fight on even when they know they could
21/07/17, 00:19 - Janith: That doesn't necessarily make them a coward
21/07/17, 00:19 - Imeldaroswara: About Contentment...

Cynthia Heimel lived in New York in the 1970s and she knew actors and artists before their fame—while they were still bussing tables and driving cabs—but she also knew them after their fame. She wrote this:

I pity celebrities. No I really do. Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Barbara Streisand were once perfectly pleasant human beings. But now their wrath is awful. I think when God wants to play a really rotten practical joke on you, he grants you your deepest wish and giggles merrily when you realize you want to kill yourself.

You see, Sly, Bruce and Barbara wanted fame. They worked, they pushed, and the morning after each of them became famous, they wanted to take an overdose. Because that giant thing they were striving for, that something that was going to make everything okay, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to provide them with personal fulfillment and happiness, had happened. And they were still them. The *disillusionment* turned them howling and insufferable. (Cynthia Heimel, The Village Voice, January 2, 1990)
21/07/17, 00:20 - Janith: A coward does it out of fear
21/07/17, 00:21 - Janith: Truer words have never been spoken. Fame is more a curse than a blessing
21/07/17, 00:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He did do it outta fear
21/07/17, 00:21 - Imeldaroswara: It's something meaningful, because it gives people so many possibilities... But once you died.... that's it. 
The end... 
Le finale...
21/07/17, 00:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He obviously did it cus he was afraid of the future
21/07/17, 00:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
21/07/17, 00:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Really good perspective
21/07/17, 00:23 - Janith: A person's life is their own. If they decide to end it then that's their choice.
21/07/17, 00:23 - Janith: I don't see how you can make that claim
21/07/17, 00:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There were millions of people following him. What an example he set for them. If you're deriving fame happily, you can't make your decisions irrespective of the people who give you that fame
21/07/17, 00:25 - Imeldaroswara: No.... Human is social "animal"... 
What you did/do/will do......will impact lives of people around you.... In a good way and in a bad way....
It's like spider's web.... Once there is a movement on one end, the other end will feel the vibration....
21/07/17, 00:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly. And his web was way too big.
21/07/17, 00:26 - Imeldaroswara: +1
21/07/17, 00:26 - Shaiju: I second it... Why people judge others and act like they got the right to say how others would have lived? In my opinion a person has only the command over his/her own life and not others. If he decides to live it or take it. It is up to him/her and others got not much voice in it.
21/07/17, 00:26 - Janith: True in a way. But if someone takes a person they look up to committing suicide as a reason to consider it then they're the cowards. They need to make the decision for themselves
21/07/17, 00:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Refer to this @918123428275
21/07/17, 00:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I can't make my defence clearer
21/07/17, 00:27 - Imeldaroswara: But not everyone in this world will have that kind of independent thinking....
Not everyone is INTP..you know..🤣
21/07/17, 00:28 - Janith: While that is true it's not a reason not to kill yourself. 
No one should be forced to suffer through something just because some others want him to
21/07/17, 00:29 - Janith: Agreed. But if the ones who don't kill themselves following Chester then that's natural selection
21/07/17, 00:30 - Shaiju: If people are followers, they are expected to be that way.... I don't follow anybody and think my life is my own to decide.. Again if somebody 'follows' anybody how did it give them the right to judge what to be 'followed'?
21/07/17, 00:30 - Imeldaroswara: This kind of thinking is dangerous... As if suffering is the end of this world... Suffering is merely part of life. Because you know happiness, you know sadness... It's 2 sides of a coin... You cannot just pick one side of it, when you have a coin.
21/07/17, 00:30 - Janith: +1
21/07/17, 00:31 - Imeldaroswara: What people need to learn is that struggle is "normal" in life... Just like some days, you have shiny sun...and some other days....you have rainstorms.. all will past actually...
21/07/17, 00:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Even if I give him that his struggle was extraordinary, still not a reason big enough to lay to waste what he did in his life
21/07/17, 00:32 - Janith: I agree with you but I don't think it's dangerous. 
I know that a lot of people kill themselves cause they want it all to be sunshine and rainbows and I consider them stupid. 
But that's not always the case. Sometimes you think about it and you don't really care that you'll lose the good side too. You're done and you want an end so you give yourself one
21/07/17, 00:32 - Imeldaroswara: Grit and persistence is a soft skill that people needs to learn... And it's not something that can be mastered in a peaceful and calm and happy life....
21/07/17, 00:33 - Janith: No one can say the dude didn't struggle. He was probably kicking and screaming most of his life. In the end I'm guessing he just decided he was done
21/07/17, 00:34 - Janith: He didn't lay waste to anything. His accomplishments are still there
21/07/17, 00:34 - Imeldaroswara: I don't know... I mean the stressful days I experience is precious...because everytime I go back home... I can be with people I love... And that's worth of every struggle I face.
21/07/17, 00:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Okay let me explain it too then. He was 41. He still had years of career ahead of him. That's how he laid it to waste
21/07/17, 00:35 - Janith: Yes. It's worth it for you. It might not be for someone else
21/07/17, 00:35 - Imeldaroswara: Whatt... That dude has children... So...he doesn't love his children...?
21/07/17, 00:35 - Imeldaroswara: *didn't.
21/07/17, 00:36 - Janith: Doesn't matter how old he was. If he felt that he was done and he wanted to end it then there's no reason to say no. 
It's a shame but its his choice
21/07/17, 00:37 - Janith: Apparently not enough to keep living for them
21/07/17, 00:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And it is laying it all to waste. Imagine future generations stumbling upon linkin park and looking up CB. Then they find that he killed himself. What impression do you even think they'd derive?
21/07/17, 00:37 - Janith: It might be hard to swallow but you kill yourself because you don't care. And he probably gave it some thought too
21/07/17, 00:38 - Janith: I hope future generations have the sense to separate the accomplishments from the man who made them
21/07/17, 00:40 - Amin: Metal dudes do this suicide thing alot
21/07/17, 00:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Tbh if you really give it a thought, there's no way anyone could ever commit suicide no matter what. If you genuinely give it a thought, you'll find it to be a dumb move. Sure you could pretend to think to convince yourself but it's pointless
21/07/17, 00:41 - Amin: Its a common way to die for em
21/07/17, 00:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @94754191589 👆🏻
21/07/17, 00:41 - Janith: I disagree. You can just not care
21/07/17, 00:42 - Amin: And how is that, what is really giving it thought?
21/07/17, 00:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You have to if you're a public personality. It's like hogging all the benefits without the responsibilities. You want the fame, you can't let your fans down
21/07/17, 00:42 - Janith: The only reason I'm keeping myself alive right now is that I've yet to achieve my goal. I'm guessing he thought somewhere along those lines too
21/07/17, 00:42 - Amin: Actually I think if you really think abouy it, suicide is pretty reasonable
21/07/17, 00:43 - Janith: You can most certainly let your fans down. You're not under any obligation to keep them motivated and entertained
21/07/17, 00:43 - Janith: They're fans because they like your work
21/07/17, 00:44 - Amin: His suicide is not about fans dude
21/07/17, 00:44 - Amin: Its about an epic end, to an epic life
21/07/17, 00:44 - Janith: Almost none of the people who are mourning him would give a flying fuck about the guy if he wasn't the singer of a band
21/07/17, 00:44 - Shaiju: Unless you have worn his shoes and lived his life,you are in no position to judge. It is his life and his reasons. How could one project ones beliefs/ideologies on somebody else and expect them to be constricted to that portrayal. That is 'moral' terrorism!
21/07/17, 00:45 - Amin: Do you know mayhem
21/07/17, 00:45 - Janith: Suicide is very reasonable when it's honest
21/07/17, 00:45 - Janith: The problem is that it's rarely honest
21/07/17, 00:46 - Janith: People do it in the spur of the moment. That's why it has so much bad rep
21/07/17, 00:46 - Janith: No. What's that?
21/07/17, 00:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: No one would've even known him then what are you trying to say
21/07/17, 00:47 - Imeldaroswara: The thing about life is.... If you don't like yours... You can change it.....
But it's only applicable if you are still breathing....
21/07/17, 00:47 - Janith: I mean that fans are never a reason to stay alive
21/07/17, 00:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If he was just another mediocre person, who cares
21/07/17, 00:47 - Amin: Hmmm, you say that suicide is a result of emotional momentary acting, mostly yes, I see ur point
21/07/17, 00:48 - Janith: His children would. His friends would. Those are the people you consider when killing yourself
21/07/17, 00:48 - Amin: Another metal dude who killed himself alot worse
21/07/17, 00:48 - Imeldaroswara: +1
21/07/17, 00:48 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well he himself didn't consider them. Why should I
21/07/17, 00:48 - Janith: Because a thoughtful suicide considers them too
21/07/17, 00:49 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're saying for my point.
21/07/17, 00:49 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It was a dumb move
21/07/17, 00:49 - Amin: Seriously, he didnt give a shit about fans dudes
21/07/17, 00:49 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep
21/07/17, 00:49 - Janith: If you consider them and still decide you want death more than life considering the problems you might cause them turn you can kill yourself
21/07/17, 00:49 - Amin: He just did it, and said ok, its done, bbye
21/07/17, 00:50 - Janith: Not quite. You think that people will always consider their loved ones as a valid enough reason to keep living on and on
21/07/17, 00:50 - Amin: But after all, let me tell u about a nee porn chanell
21/07/17, 00:50 - Janith: I'm saying it's not always the case
21/07/17, 00:50 - Amin: Family therapy
21/07/17, 00:50 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm not?

21/07/17, 00:51 - Amin: 😂😂
21/07/17, 00:52 - Janith: Then what's the problem?
21/07/17, 00:52 - Amin: Its like son has hurt his balls, and mom trying to help him, and ...
21/07/17, 00:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: As much as my senseless self would love to argue more, I need to go
21/07/17, 00:53 - Janith: Senseless yes. At least on this point
21/07/17, 00:53 - Amin: Jerk of before you go
21/07/17, 00:53 - Janith: Have a nice day dude! 😊
21/07/17, 00:53 - Janith: Or don't.

21/07/17, 00:53 - Janith: Whatever floats your boat 😂
21/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Janith check family therapy out
21/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Go xvideos
21/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Channels
21/07/17, 00:54 - Janith: Amin why is it that when you're in a conversation there's always talk about porn and stuff like that?
21/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Family therapy
21/07/17, 00:54 - Janith: Been there noped that 😂
21/07/17, 00:54 - Amin: Dude I am that
21/07/17, 00:55 - Amin: See, there is a point in sex
21/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: Procreation
21/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: Or entertainment
21/07/17, 00:55 - Amin: Every thing is about it
21/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: But entertainment is an evolutionary byproduct
21/07/17, 00:55 - Amin: Believe me man, we are who we are, because of whom we fucked
21/07/17, 00:56 - Janith: Oh good so I'm no one 😂
21/07/17, 00:56 - Amin: Exactly 😂😂
21/07/17, 00:56 - Amin: You are shadow
21/07/17, 00:57 - Janith: I am shadow. I am dark
21/07/17, 00:57 - Amin: Me too
21/07/17, 00:57 - Amin: I love it dark
21/07/17, 00:58 - Amin: Dude I am darkside, I like it
21/07/17, 00:58 - Amin: Ok its 8:30
21/07/17, 00:58 - Amin: I have to go
21/07/17, 00:58 - Amin: Bbye👋
21/07/17, 00:59 - Janith: No you're not. Get away from my dark. You're just an amalgamation of hookers and exes 😂
21/07/17, 00:59 - Janith: See you later Amin 🙋‍♂
21/07/17, 00:59 - Amin: Your dark sounds white 😅
21/07/17, 00:59 - Amin: See ya 👋
21/07/17, 01:02 - Janith: My dark is one with death and decay a plenty. Where the maggots feed on the corpses of those who have given up and the ones that keep going are fumbling through the darkness. Too terrified to stop, too terrified to lie down they keep going they know not where
21/07/17, 02:13 - Lulu: A hasty spur of the moment suicide considers no one
21/07/17, 02:14 - Lulu: But none Of us could know what he was thinking
21/07/17, 02:14 - Lulu: If he took any of these counts into consideration
21/07/17, 02:15 - Lulu: Or any of the above, I know when someone is dead there is not much to do but to assume motivations and their thoughts is just not right to an extent
21/07/17, 02:19 - Janith: Agreed. He's dead. Leave him be
21/07/17, 02:20 - Lulu: It's definitely something that can and should be talked about but what's the point of conversation when it's just a big lump of being angry and saying he never cared about his family or fans because he took his life
21/07/17, 02:22 - Janith: I don't think it has to do with someone never caring. Just that the need to get it over with overrides any concerns they might have
21/07/17, 04:42 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Oh, you were talking about suicide
21/07/17, 04:43 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: What a difficult topic to talk about
21/07/17, 05:16 - Tel: Haha great disguise!!
21/07/17, 05:19 - Tel: Perhaps he did search for help, but the help wasn't what he needed.. Who knows what's going on inside the head of someone desperate enough to commit the final act. Shaiju's poem (did you write this or paste? Really good..) is indicative of the mask some (a lot?) wear
21/07/17, 05:21 - Juancho: I know this is completely out of place

21/07/17, 22:54 - Juancho: You know, i've never been a big fan of anime
21/07/17, 22:54 - Juancho: But as attack on titan progresses as well as code geass
21/07/17, 22:54 - Juancho: I'm starting to like anime
21/07/17, 23:03 - Janith: I've yet to watch code geass but I am a fan of AoT

21/07/17, 23:25 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm really sure I'm.not an intp
21/07/17, 23:25 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't know why the thingy says I am
21/07/17, 23:28 - Janith: Why do you say that?
21/07/17, 23:28 - Janith: INTPs generally spend most of their free time being bored 😆
21/07/17, 23:29 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I'm too emotional for being an intp
21/07/17, 23:29 - Shaiju: I think that boredome is second nature to every INTP..
21/07/17, 23:29 - Janith: We I was too at one point. In my case that was because I had an unstable Fe
21/07/17, 23:30 - Shaiju: Oh.... Intps  are emotional but they are scared to show that side... We are immature feelers.. It is our vulnerability ..sigh!
21/07/17, 23:30 - Janith: After I started taking meds for my OCD it all fell into place
21/07/17, 23:30 - Janith: Also Fe means we can't really bottle up emotions too well
21/07/17, 23:33 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I don't know
21/07/17, 23:33 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: I tend to explode
21/07/17, 23:33 - ‪+56 9 8484 5077‬: 😹
21/07/17, 23:36 - Shaiju: Again...that is a typical INTP there.. self doubt and using others as sounding board for the self reflection. Mostly testing opinions or findings which does not have a firm standing within oneself on others to explore their opinion.. it's part of an internal debate... :)
21/07/17, 23:55 - Juancho: Tell me about it.
22/07/17, 00:38 - Matt: Lmao
22/07/17, 04:45 - Juancho: And when you're not suffering from boredom, you are obsessed about something and oblivious of your surrounding because you are daydreaming.
22/07/17, 04:49 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
22/07/17, 04:49 - Shaiju: Lotus eaters! I wonder why we tend to be so irrational during day dreaming while in real life we  try to rationalize everything.
22/07/17, 04:49 - FABIO: this is heaven.
22/07/17, 04:50 - Shaiju: Do anybody imagine alternative realities or personalities during day dreaming?

22/07/17, 22:17 - Shaiju: 😋
22/07/17, 22:28 - Shaiju: The fact is that when you live some time in subzero temperatures, a plus sign looks awesome (not Fahrenheit). I remember when I considered 2°C as pleasant weather back in Canada. It is funny when you have lived most of the life in tropical weather with high humidity. I used to go for walks when temperature raised to 1°C.
22/07/17, 23:00 - Shaiju: *was at

22/07/17, 23:59 - Lulu: Like scarfs kinda make me feel suffocated and I'm not good w jackets
23/07/17, 00:00 - Lulu: Unless I'm in a car that I'm waiting for to warm up I can't bundle up above the chest region
23/07/17, 00:00 - Lulu: I feel suffocated I

23/07/17, 00:00 - Lulu: Like T-shirts and that all good

23/07/17, 00:12 - Janith: I guess it all depends on which region you call home. I can't stand the cold either
23/07/17, 00:13 - Janith: I'm always surprised by how comfortable my Canadian friend is in temperatures I would lose it in
23/07/17, 00:14 - Janith: And she feels the same way with my temperature range too
23/07/17, 00:17 - Imeldaroswara: Hahaha....those people that still jogging in the winter makes me wonder....is it me that is abnormal... can't handle low temperature.... 
Or is it them that is abnormal...can handle such low temperature....

23/07/17, 00:19 - Juancho: Are worthy of my hotspot
23/07/17, 00:19 - Juancho: Hahahahahah
23/07/17, 00:21 - Juancho: Ohh yeah, i'm also going to ask the person the most recently discovered and most significant particle which is mostly comprised of each group
23/07/17, 00:24 - Janith: How long is the password??
23/07/17, 00:24 - Juancho: I've come to the realization that I need to develop a password in binary akin to my hotspot password but with an even more complex system.
23/07/17, 00:24 - Janith: Definitely. Evolution is beautiful
23/07/17, 00:25 - Janith: I mostly just use stuff only I know about
23/07/17, 00:26 - Imeldaroswara: One question though... Why?
23/07/17, 00:26 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>

23/07/17, 00:27 - Juancho: Hahahahahahaha
23/07/17, 00:27 - Juancho: Pretty much
23/07/17, 00:27 - Janith: That would actually be a reason for me to stay offline most of the time 😂
23/07/17, 00:27 - Janith: Way too long to bother typing that in
23/07/17, 00:28 - Janith: Nice deterrent man
23/07/17, 00:28 - Juancho: Honestly, to piss people off and simply because I can.
23/07/17, 00:28 - Juancho: Not to mention the fact that it's fun af to decode and play games.
23/07/17, 00:28 - Juancho: Hahahaha. That's the plan.
23/07/17, 00:28 - Janith: 😂 this is why other types might hate us

23/07/17, 02:07 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Ruby on Rails and React

From Quora:
"React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that has been dominating the front-end world over the last 3 years. 

There is a huge demand for React engineers, so if you know how to build with React, in this climate you can easily find a job. Now what makes this the “highest” arbitrage technology is that you can also use React Native to build iOS and Android application, reusing most of your code.

You no longer need to know Objective C, Swift or Java to make cool mobile apps. You can do it all with React (JavaScript)."
23/07/17, 02:17 - Imeldaroswara: AWS... Amazon Web Services...
I know several big companies are currently moving all their program to cloud services....
23/07/17, 02:19 - Imeldaroswara: Actually in IT....it doesn't matter what language you can do....most important thing is that you can learn something really quick and reach mastery level faster than anyone.

23/07/17, 05:52 - Imeldaroswara: I will be hermit.. totally will not go out....😝
23/07/17, 05:53 - Maureen: -20 and 42 are the extremes in germany. I experienced both

23/07/17, 05:55 - Juancho: My parents took me to a party (birthday celebration of of friend of theirs), finished reading my book, pondered at every question possible (very productive I might add), was then bored out of my mind and my parents told me I could go stay by myself in the car (it was about 200 meters from everybody)
23/07/17, 05:55 - Juancho: A chill ran down my spine
23/07/17, 05:55 - Juancho: Was so fucking thrilled to have some alone time for first time in the week.
23/07/17, 05:55 - Imeldaroswara: Apparently I am a healthy INTP..... Should I be sad or happy...? Don't know..
23/07/17, 05:55 - Juancho: I fucking love hermit mode
23/07/17, 05:56 - Maureen: in the winter 2010/2011. we talked in school about the temp and it was colder outside of town. like 20-30 km outside
23/07/17, 05:56 - Imeldaroswara: Then you need to get a job where you will have less interaction with people.
23/07/17, 05:56 - Maureen: we had -20, a classmate on the other side of the town had -19
23/07/17, 05:57 - Imeldaroswara: If only I knew that I am an INTP sooner.... Sigh..
23/07/17, 05:57 - Maureen: same

23/07/17, 05:58 - Maureen: it's more like who suffers the most
23/07/17, 05:58 - Juancho: Unless it's at a american, European or Indian college
23/07/17, 05:58 - Imeldaroswara: What...so you plan to live off of your parents for the rest of your life....?
23/07/17, 05:58 - Juancho: And they give me a research job

23/07/17, 06:00 - Imeldaroswara: But when I was in school, I was truly jealous with the education system in US or Europe...you have so many types of holidays... Summer holiday, winter holiday.... Sigh
23/07/17, 06:00 - Imeldaroswara: Still it's good to plan early....

23/07/17, 06:02 - Maureen: but school stuff is federal state stuff
23/07/17, 06:02 - Imeldaroswara: It could be due to seasons...most of asian countries only have 2 seasons, rain or dry....so cannot truly have a season where we could lazy around after the harvest....
23/07/17, 06:02 - Maureen: so it's different for every state within germany
23/07/17, 06:03 - Imeldaroswara: I feel like I am missing of what supposed to be the best years in school years..

23/07/17, 07:15 - Tel: Or schizophrenic label. Whichever floats your boat
23/07/17, 07:16 - Tel: I really think mbti, or something similar, ought to be taught to kids, at an acceptable age, at school.. More important than some stuff they learn at school
23/07/17, 07:18 - Tel: I saw some advert for English teachers in the far east (can't remember which country) the other day.. I was shocked when it said it only offered 10 days annual leave as well as bank holidays (or their equivalent). Kids / teachers are meant to have way more! Heck, I even get 29 in my current job, plus bank hols
23/07/17, 08:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah it's disappointing

23/07/17, 10:20 - Janith: I do that too sometimes
23/07/17, 10:21 - Janith: Wonder if that's just us or if it's an INTP thing
23/07/17, 10:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: What if you say it to someone who does not know about the conventions of the human language?
23/07/17, 10:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Like, an alien visiting warth
23/07/17, 10:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: *earth

23/07/17, 10:24 - Lulu: But I also really enjoy literature and using other words to describe things to get the greater feel or meaning across of them is kind of a usual thing
23/07/17, 10:25 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Someone's sentiment hurt ? Someone needs personal space? Someone getting 150+messages ??
23/07/17, 10:25 - Lulu: Lmao
23/07/17, 10:25 - Lulu: Probably 150+
23/07/17, 10:26 - Janith: I swear I only notice most of the people who leave after they've left
23/07/17, 10:26 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I also enjoy that (not always) but I don't use it in conversations as they lead to unnecessary misunderstandings

23/07/17, 10:41 - Lulu: The thing is it doesn't say the name when people leave so when they do I just assume it was a new person who didn't conversate much and got tired of the tons of messages
23/07/17, 10:43 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Abstract. "ton" is a unit of weight

23/07/17, 10:56 - Lulu: Hmm?
23/07/17, 10:57 - Amin: How is ur relation with fear?
23/07/17, 10:57 - Amin: Are u pessimistic about every person u know?
23/07/17, 10:57 - Lulu: Depends on my mental State
23/07/17, 10:57 - Imeldaroswara: I don't correct others... I usually supply the words that they somehow missed/forgot.. 😁
23/07/17, 10:57 - Amin: Like to think the ways they can hurt you
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: I am rarely pessimistic about people but always cautious of them
23/07/17, 10:58 - Amin: Or like when u get friendly with them
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: Same although when I was young I would correct my moms speech a lot lol
23/07/17, 10:58 - Amin: Do u think they are going to hurt you?
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: Not really
23/07/17, 10:58 - Amin: Noted
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: But I'm always prepare door it
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: For*
23/07/17, 10:58 - Lulu: You never know man
23/07/17, 10:59 - Amin: So is it an intp thing?
23/07/17, 10:59 - Lulu: Idk
23/07/17, 10:59 - Amin: Fear of others
23/07/17, 10:59 - Amin: Trust issues
23/07/17, 10:59 - Amin: Oh trust
23/07/17, 10:59 - Lulu: I think a lot of people are like that tho aside from intp
23/07/17, 10:59 - Amin: Can you ever trust any one?
23/07/17, 11:00 - Amin: I mean even alittle bit
23/07/17, 11:00 - Lulu: Yes
23/07/17, 11:00 - Amin: Hmmm
23/07/17, 11:00 - Amin: I cant
23/07/17, 11:00 - Lulu: I mean this is just me
23/07/17, 11:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I rarely trust anyone. Whenever I did, I regretted
23/07/17, 11:01 - Amin: 👍👍
23/07/17, 11:01 - Lulu: I always keep a comfy middle ground although I trust some more than others
23/07/17, 11:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: No. It usually comes naturally
23/07/17, 11:02 - Lulu: I can sense and analyze personalities fairly easily
23/07/17, 11:02 - Lulu: So I know when to look out or not
23/07/17, 11:02 - Lulu: Or when to make a distance between the relationship
23/07/17, 11:03 - Imeldaroswara: Yes...but once that trust was betrayed.... Then it's time to say bye bye...
23/07/17, 11:03 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I feel that I can trust them first. But then I realise that it was just another dirty face  with a neat mask
23/07/17, 11:03 - Lulu: Intentions aren't hard to read on most people although without confirmation you can only stay on ur toes
23/07/17, 11:03 - Amin: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 11:04 - Amin: When u tell some one a secret, dont u always regret?
23/07/17, 11:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Exactly what's with me
23/07/17, 11:04 - Amin: Yea me the same
23/07/17, 11:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Usually.
23/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: I mean once someone does something bad to u of course it's cut loose bye
23/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: I'd feel no remorse
23/07/17, 11:05 - Amin: 😂😂😂 ur world should be scary as mine
23/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: But I'm often not bothered by most things so
23/07/17, 11:05 - Amin: Oh my world ks very scary
23/07/17, 11:05 - Lulu: 🤷🏻‍♀
23/07/17, 11:06 - Amin: Hmm
23/07/17, 11:06 - Amin: Maybe its a boy/girl thing
23/07/17, 11:06 - Lulu: Like I don't mind actions because at the end of the day everyone has their own motivations
23/07/17, 11:06 - Amin: Honey
23/07/17, 11:06 - Lulu: Whether they be good or bad intentions are usually good
23/07/17, 11:06 - Amin: Chill

23/07/17, 11:07 - Amin: Oh, u r telling ur theories
23/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Depends on who sees it
23/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Idk but that's a cute emoji
23/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: Idk how u can sense my mood by text lol but you sensed it wrong, and I'm not saying that because I'm feeling defensive just trying to let u know
23/07/17, 11:08 - Amin: I am psycho
23/07/17, 11:08 - Amin: Sry lulu
23/07/17, 11:08 - Lulu: They aren't theories for me they are reality

23/07/17, 11:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Psycho is an anti-social person

23/07/17, 11:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: So am i
23/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: To be fairly honest I don't really care I'm not trying to be rude I'm just speaking my mind honestly
23/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: I'm not completely but I'm ways I am
23/07/17, 11:11 - Amin: Why is every thing about people is so dark in my head?
23/07/17, 11:11 - Amin: 😂😂
23/07/17, 11:11 - Amin: And, I miss sex
23/07/17, 11:11 - Lulu: I can talk friendly with people and all that but I rarely have actual friends
23/07/17, 11:12 - Amin: This pile of work
23/07/17, 11:12 - Amin: I like work more than sex though

23/07/17, 12:46 - Didier: Supercomputer?
23/07/17, 12:46 - Janith: Err... Not quite. Our functions are quite different
23/07/17, 12:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: A really big and fast computer 😂
23/07/17, 12:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Look it up
23/07/17, 12:46 - Janith: INFPs and INTJs are more similar

23/07/17, 12:47 - Didier: Hmm,I don't think so actually
23/07/17, 12:47 - Amin: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 12:47 - Amin: Did u know INFJ s are rare af?
23/07/17, 12:47 - Didier: Yup
23/07/17, 12:47 - Didier: I have an INFJ friend

23/07/17, 12:47 - Amin: I hate em
23/07/17, 12:48 - Amin: 😂😂
23/07/17, 12:48 - Didier: INFJs seem like extroverts at first but they r introverts
23/07/17, 12:48 - Didier: Really?She's very nice though
23/07/17, 12:48 - Amin: I hate her no matter what
23/07/17, 12:48 - Didier: No wonder I always thought to myself why is she so sociable yet I feel comfortable with her
23/07/17, 12:48 - Didier: INFJs are sociable introverts
23/07/17, 12:48 - Didier: Outgoing
23/07/17, 12:49 - Amin: Entp 's
23/07/17, 12:49 - Amin: Are my favorites
23/07/17, 12:49 - Didier: I've also met an INTJ before
23/07/17, 12:49 - Amin: My last favorites were infp
23/07/17, 12:49 - Amin: Not anymore
23/07/17, 12:49 - Janith: Apologies @6582280971 I made a mistake
23/07/17, 12:49 - Didier: Entps I generally like them but
23/07/17, 12:49 - Janith: Your intuitive and sensing functions are switched
23/07/17, 12:50 - Didier: That guy is too um 😓 what's that word,stupid?
23/07/17, 12:50 - Didier: Hahaha

23/07/17, 12:50 - Amin: Intp,intj s are smartest group
23/07/17, 12:51 - Amin: Entp's stand next

23/07/17, 12:51 - Didier: What,Amin
23/07/17, 12:51 - Amin: How is that possible?
23/07/17, 12:52 - Didier: It's possible
23/07/17, 12:52 - Amin: Judgmental people unlike perceiving ones
23/07/17, 12:52 - Didier: To hate ur own kind
23/07/17, 12:52 - Didier: Or just some
23/07/17, 12:52 - Didier: Not all
23/07/17, 12:52 - Didier: Or perhaps all

23/07/17, 12:53 - Didier: What do u mean?
23/07/17, 12:53 - Didier: We have a common factor now
23/07/17, 12:53 - Amin: We hate for different reasons
23/07/17, 12:53 - Didier: I think it's because a lot of parents I know r Js
23/07/17, 12:54 - Didier: If u noticed,for both female and male groups,Js r at the top
23/07/17, 12:54 - Amin: Yup
23/07/17, 12:54 - Didier: Haha maybe
23/07/17, 12:54 - Didier: How about u?
23/07/17, 12:54 - Amin: I dont hate people actually

23/07/17, 12:55 - Amin: And try so harf
23/07/17, 12:55 - Amin: Hard*
23/07/17, 12:55 - Amin: For stupid things
23/07/17, 12:55 - Didier: I agree on this one
23/07/17, 12:55 - Didier: Yeah,I've thought about it too
23/07/17, 12:55 - Amin: Without knowing that how stupidly they are trying for stupid stuff
23/07/17, 12:56 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Through religion and media? Maybe even the Internet
23/07/17, 12:56 - Didier: We each specialise in our own things too
23/07/17, 12:56 - Amin: In my country through religion and media
23/07/17, 12:56 - Didier: If u divide it,everything should be fine.Why fight over it like that?
23/07/17, 12:57 - Didier: I've thought about it
23/07/17, 12:57 - Didier: Especially seeing my mother work
23/07/17, 12:58 - Amin: But working hard is so goddamn fun
23/07/17, 12:58 - Amin: U know
23/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: Yes,that's how religion becomes corrupted
23/07/17, 12:58 - Amin: Knowing that u chose a stupid thing
23/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: Something meant to be used for good is using for the opposite reason
23/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: Manipulation
23/07/17, 12:58 - Amin: And try hard to get it but knowing that its stupid
23/07/17, 12:58 - Amin: Is so god damn fun
23/07/17, 12:59 - Didier: Haha Amin
23/07/17, 12:59 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: This really gets to me. I find it hard making a meaning with everything and everyone just being stupid in front of me. I'm probably more judgemental than most intps
23/07/17, 12:59 - Didier: Amin,u r quite ironic if u noticed
23/07/17, 12:59 - Amin: I love working hard stupidly
23/07/17, 12:59 - Amin: And I actually dont get paid
23/07/17, 12:59 - Amin: 😂😂
23/07/17, 12:59 - Amin: I only do it because its like u are achieving something
23/07/17, 12:59 - Amin: Helps u feel better
23/07/17, 12:59 - Didier: Life experience,maybe that's how u become more judgemental?
23/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Yah I've actually tried fitting in everywhere.
23/07/17, 13:00 - Amin: I am a paradox 😂
23/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: So I know how it's like to be in some people's shoes
23/07/17, 13:01 - Amin: Ive learned to stop doing every thing for a reason
23/07/17, 13:01 - Amin: By my reasoning I should kill my self
23/07/17, 13:01 - Amin: But fuck that
23/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: 😂

23/07/17, 15:14 - Amin: So is right what most people do?
23/07/17, 15:14 - Didier: Nope
23/07/17, 15:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Thats morally right
23/07/17, 15:15 - Juancho: Hahahahaha no.

23/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: Because wrong cannot be right
23/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: Unless it's concerning perspective
23/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: So are ur believes right?
23/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: Different perspectives mean different thinking of wrong and right
23/07/17, 15:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Gimme what you're smoking @989306939802  😂
23/07/17, 15:17 - Didier: For example u have a lot of questions
23/07/17, 15:17 - Didier: U can only answer them with true or false
23/07/17, 15:17 - Didier: Example 4+4=8
23/07/17, 15:17 - Amin: What is perspective
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: It is true,hence it cannot be false
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Unless u argue that
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: They r just symbols
23/07/17, 15:18 - Arne: The way you can look at things
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: 4+4 can equal to 9 if u want it to
23/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: So is right symbolic?
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Then ur sense of right is different from others' sense of right
23/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: Didier u r doing good
23/07/17, 15:18 - Amin: Math is the way
23/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Sense of right and wrong
23/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: Right or wrong is about values
23/07/17, 15:19 - Arne: You mean, it doesn't have a meaning. We give it a meaning
23/07/17, 15:19 - Amin: Very well arne
23/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: If it's something more straightforward,right and wrong is easy to define
23/07/17, 15:19 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: For example,math
23/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: That's why people argue over things that need different perspectives
23/07/17, 15:19 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: I know u r a troll Amin
23/07/17, 15:20 - Didier: Just wanted to clear it up hahaha
23/07/17, 15:20 - Arne: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:20 - Amin: So can we say right is a subjective concept?
23/07/17, 15:20 - Arne: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: Arne have u studied philosophy?
23/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: Lol
23/07/17, 15:21 - Arne: I'm 15
23/07/17, 15:21 - Arne: What do u think 🤣
23/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: U should
23/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: Most of the time
23/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: Actually
23/07/17, 15:21 - Arne: My family says that too 🤣🤣🤣
23/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: Right is a subjective word itself
23/07/17, 15:21 - Didier: So u can say so
23/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: So is doing what u believe is right, right?
23/07/17, 15:22 - Arne: No it isnt
23/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Answer it the way I taught u to reason
23/07/17, 15:22 - Arne: You got the feeling it is right.
23/07/17, 15:22 - Arne: That's something different
23/07/17, 15:22 - Didier: Not necessarily
23/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Not necessarily
23/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Didier
23/07/17, 15:22 - Didier: Anyway I gotta sleep
23/07/17, 15:22 - Didier: 🤣

23/07/17, 15:23 - Didier: Night guys
23/07/17, 15:23 - Amin: Why do I act in a way that I dont believe
23/07/17, 15:23 - Amin: Remember?
23/07/17, 15:23 - Arne: I have a vacation for 6 weeks 😭😭👏😇😇
23/07/17, 15:23 - Didier: Don't believe what?
23/07/17, 15:23 - Arne: In gos
23/07/17, 15:23 - Arne: God
23/07/17, 15:23 - Amin: For example
23/07/17, 15:23 - Amin: I believe that working is stupid
23/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: Ohh
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: And is for earning stupid things
23/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: I get what u mean
23/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: I can see the two diff perspectives
23/07/17, 15:24 - Didier: It also depends on what u r working for
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: But I work most of the time
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: For no reason
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: I believe in islam
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: But I act diffrent
23/07/17, 15:24 - Arne: Working can mean progress. And progress makes you better in stuff. So not useless
23/07/17, 15:24 - Amin: Completely diffrent
23/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: So why should we do what we believe is right
23/07/17, 15:25 - Didier: I can see why u r a perceiver
23/07/17, 15:25 - Didier: Yeah 😂
23/07/17, 15:25 - Arne: It is ethical
23/07/17, 15:25 - Amin: What we believe is right is exactly wrong from another perspective
23/07/17, 15:25 - Didier: But rmb,our beliefs itself may not be right
23/07/17, 15:25 - Arne: So doing what you think is right, gives you a good feeling.
23/07/17, 15:25 - Didier: That's why our beliefs change for the better sometimes
23/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: What is progress?
23/07/17, 15:26 - Arne: 🙄
23/07/17, 15:26 - Didier: Lol
23/07/17, 15:26 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:27 - Didier: That's why we always need to improve
23/07/17, 15:27 - Didier: Be open
23/07/17, 15:27 - Juancho: @94754191589 I just saw a picture that said: "Escaping Atheism, because Atheism is bullshit"
23/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: Why do we need to improve?
23/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: What is improvement?
23/07/17, 15:27 - Juancho: "Bullshit"😂😂😂😂
23/07/17, 15:27 - Janith: Definition-wise it is
23/07/17, 15:28 - Janith: But it's more convenient to use
23/07/17, 15:28 - Didier: Thought I'ma dominant Fi(strong sense of right and wrong) user,I or we actually dislike other Fi users
23/07/17, 15:28 - Juancho: Hahaha
23/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: What is atheism?
23/07/17, 15:28 - Didier: Because Fi is not their dominant
23/07/17, 15:28 - Janith: @989306939802 let's discuss this seriously. I see you're going really philosophical
23/07/17, 15:28 - Didier: They often use it unwisely
23/07/17, 15:28 - Janith: Belief that there is no god
23/07/17, 15:28 - Juancho: As Ernest Hemingway once said: All thinking men are Atheists
23/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: I agree
23/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: What is God?
23/07/17, 15:29 - Janith: You tell me
23/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: What is Fi, what is wise?
23/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: Lead better lives
23/07/17, 15:29 - Didier: Harmony
23/07/17, 15:29 - Amin: I dont know
23/07/17, 15:29 - Janith: After all you're the theist remember?
23/07/17, 15:29 - Arne: God is a superior being - - we gave it a human factor.
23/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: Lol
23/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: Troll
23/07/17, 15:30 - Arne: If God exist at least
23/07/17, 15:30 - Janith: A god can be classified as a being with supernatural power
23/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: Fi is introverted feeling if udk
23/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: @94754191589 "Atheism is about science, logic, reason, and evidence. Religion is the opposite of those things.
4 Atheism is about facts over feelings."
23/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: What is a better life?
23/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: So is superman a God?
23/07/17, 15:30 - Arne: People believe in God, so it exist for them. So as long as people believe, God is there.
23/07/17, 15:30 - Didier: We don't know if it exists or not,but I think the god we made up is just a source of comfort for us to begin with
23/07/17, 15:31 - Amin: Are witches Gods?
23/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: Totally agreed.
23/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: Such a compelling argument.
23/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: They actually use these are argumenrs
23/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: WTFFFFFDD
23/07/17, 15:31 - Amin: People believe in love, does that work the same way?
23/07/17, 15:31 - Didier: Need to sleep so won't be answering 😂
23/07/17, 15:32 - Janith: Here's the thing Juancho. Atheism has been associated with all that cause they have a correlation. But they are unrelated
23/07/17, 15:32 - Amin: Sleep tight love 😘
23/07/17, 15:32 - Arne: No, because science says it exist.
23/07/17, 15:32 - Janith: Athiesm is the lack of belief in a creator diety. Just that
23/07/17, 15:32 - Didier: Yeah,Idk why people make a big deal out of it
23/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: What is a diety?
23/07/17, 15:33 - Didier: Deity?
23/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: God ir goddess
23/07/17, 15:33 - Janith: deity= god
23/07/17, 15:33 - Arne: Believe in God, and in science
23/07/17, 15:33 - Amin: Or*
23/07/17, 15:34 - Arne: Or something like that. A year ago it was in my history book
23/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: Again janith, what is God?
23/07/17, 15:34 - Didier: Amin u troll
23/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+55 18 99115-8472‬: It exists as an interpretation, It is no more than just another body function we decided to give meaning to
23/07/17, 15:34 - Didier: Bye-
23/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If i were religious it would make a big deal for me
23/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I mean thats your reality then so you cant tolerate someone who shits on "the rules"
23/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Because you re making a fool out of everyone who does
23/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: Im not trolling
23/07/17, 15:34 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Doesnt*
23/07/17, 15:34 - Amin: Im teaching u thinking
23/07/17, 15:35 - Janith: Already defined it
23/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Ok I'll help u
23/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: God is defined in different ways
23/07/17, 15:35 - Amin: Religions define god as a being wich created universe
23/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: Philosophy defines God as being, existence
23/07/17, 15:36 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They dont define god
23/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: And ...
23/07/17, 15:36 - Arne: Religions define God is as a perfect being
23/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: So when I ask you what is God
23/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: U can either answer I dont know
23/07/17, 15:36 - Amin: Or ask the diffrent meaning
23/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: Janith
23/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: It looks that u dont believe in what you dont know
23/07/17, 15:37 - Janith: A creature with supernatural abilities
23/07/17, 15:37 - Amin: Is super man a God?
23/07/17, 15:37 - Janith: Whoops wrong quote
23/07/17, 15:37 - Janith: Super man doesn't exist
23/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: Actually....same can be said about the abrahamic gods
23/07/17, 15:38 - Arne: Superman is also created by the imagination of humans
23/07/17, 15:38 - Arne: If it is imagination ofc
23/07/17, 15:38 - Amin: I agree
23/07/17, 15:38 - Janith: Allah/that other one whose name eludes me
23/07/17, 15:38 - Amin: The God u defined does not exist janith
23/07/17, 15:39 - Arne: How do you know
23/07/17, 15:39 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 15:39 - Amin: A creature with supernatural abilities does not exist
23/07/17, 15:39 - Arne: Because you can't define a God, you say, why it can't be a creature with  supernatural abilities
23/07/17, 15:40 - Arne: Hmm OK. Than it isn't supernatural anymore
23/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: In janith defenition of God
23/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: I am an atheist too
23/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: And yet you still believe in Allah
23/07/17, 15:40 - Janith: ....just sayin
23/07/17, 15:41 - Janith: I smell something fishy
23/07/17, 15:41 - Arne: They say God is perfect
23/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: Allah is some thing I dont know what is
23/07/17, 15:41 - Arne: So how can a perfect being be perfect
23/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: U cant call it a creature
23/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: With super natural powers
23/07/17, 15:41 - Janith: So he cannot exist. The universe doesn't allow for a perfect system
23/07/17, 15:41 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 15:41 - Amin: I cant understand allah
23/07/17, 15:42 - Juancho: You guys have no fucking idea how hard i'm laughing
23/07/17, 15:42 - Arne: There was also something with a cat. In Europa or so
23/07/17, 15:42 - Arne: And they made a lion from the netherlands
23/07/17, 15:42 - Amin: Juancho
23/07/17, 15:42 - Amin: Fella
23/07/17, 15:43 - Amin: Stop being dumb
23/07/17, 15:43 - Amin: Seriously
23/07/17, 15:43 - Janith: Aaaand I've been converted 😂😂😂
23/07/17, 15:43 - Arne: If you can't understand Allah. How can he told his rules the way you can understand. How can you know he is.
23/07/17, 15:43 - Juancho: @94754191589 Can you believe this guy?
23/07/17, 15:43 - Janith: lead by example I always say 😅
23/07/17, 15:43 - Juancho: Don't even get me started with your dumbass religion
23/07/17, 15:44 - Amin: I can understand allah rules
23/07/17, 15:44 - Arne: So this leads to imagination of what he is.
23/07/17, 15:44 - Juancho: Not sure why I need to say this but, i'm insulting your religion, not you.
23/07/17, 15:44 - Amin: How do u know u are?
23/07/17, 15:44 - Didier: A chicken with one leg
23/07/17, 15:44 - Arne: So you can understand him. At least for a bit. That's something else that you said above.
23/07/17, 15:45 - Amin: Im not insulting u for religious stuff, Im insulting you to get your attention
23/07/17, 15:45 - Arne: Because of the famous words. I don't know them in the English. The translation is different. "I doubt, so I am"
23/07/17, 15:45 - Amin: No I dont
23/07/17, 15:46 - Amin: Do you know rene descartes
23/07/17, 15:46 - Amin: ?
23/07/17, 15:46 - Arne: Heard of. Forgot about what et. C
23/07/17, 15:46 - Didier: Amin is a walking paradox
23/07/17, 15:47 - Arne: You should sleep
23/07/17, 15:47 - Amin: He is an intp philospher
23/07/17, 15:47 - Didier: Just bored 😂 Okay
23/07/17, 15:47 - Amin: See, we most have no idea what we are talking about
23/07/17, 15:48 - Arne: You saying that we aren't boring either? That's great
23/07/17, 15:48 - Amin: For example juancho
23/07/17, 15:48 - Amin: He laughs at stupid people because they say stupid things
23/07/17, 15:48 - Didier: I think it depends on the topic
23/07/17, 15:49 - Amin: And then he takes the results that religion is stupid
23/07/17, 15:49 - Amin: 😂😂😂
23/07/17, 15:49 - Janith: I say religion is stupid too. Purely because it is
23/07/17, 15:49 - Arne: Subjective.
23/07/17, 15:49 - Didier: Maybe they meant the outcome
23/07/17, 15:49 - Amin: What is stupid?
23/07/17, 15:50 - Amin: Dude u are talented
23/07/17, 15:50 - Didier: I think some stories and quotes r nice
23/07/17, 15:50 - Arne: Subjective.
23/07/17, 15:50 - Didier: I just take them as bedtime stories 😂
23/07/17, 15:50 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 15:50 - Didier: Because the outcome of religion is devastating
23/07/17, 15:50 - Janith: Didn't we say we weren't gonna be dumb?
23/07/17, 15:50 - Arne: Ego is over 9000. Thank you
23/07/17, 15:51 - Amin: Who do you mean by we?
23/07/17, 15:51 - Didier: Hahaha I like it when people admit their ego
23/07/17, 15:51 - Didier: Unlike those who don't
23/07/17, 15:51 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 15:51 - Janith: True. Stop being dumb Amin
23/07/17, 15:51 - Juancho: These trollers man

23/07/17, 15:52 - Didier: Amin getting lectured in return
23/07/17, 15:52 - Arne: Oh it is weird. I almost never show my ego in life. Only when comfortable
23/07/17, 15:52 - Amin: 😂😂😂 why do you find me dumb?
23/07/17, 15:52 - Arne: Screenshot it for later
23/07/17, 15:52 - Amin: It helps
23/07/17, 15:53 - Didier: U mean u try to seem neutral most of the time?
23/07/17, 15:53 - Amin: U know there were people in the past asked the questions I ask now
23/07/17, 15:53 - Arne: Yes
23/07/17, 15:53 - Amin: And they wrote their thoughts
23/07/17, 15:53 - Amin: Their answers
23/07/17, 15:53 - Arne: Okay I'll check it out. Have some nice Summertime.
23/07/17, 15:53 - Amin: And their debates with each other
23/07/17, 15:53 - Amin: U gonna love descartes

23/07/17, 15:55 - Didier: I understand what he is trying to say
23/07/17, 15:55 - Didier: I've often thought of this without being able to put it into words
23/07/17, 15:56 - Amin: https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality
23/07/17, 15:56 - Janith: FYI. that's one of the dude's most misinterpreted quotes

23/07/17, 16:03 - Janith: Quote in context explains that einstin never argued for religion
23/07/17, 16:04 - Janith: He despised the idea of a personal god
23/07/17, 16:04 - Didier: Is that confirmed?
23/07/17, 16:04 - Didier: R u sure he despised it?
23/07/17, 16:04 - Didier: Or he just thinks that it's not something we should believe in
23/07/17, 16:05 - Amin: No

23/07/17, 16:10 - Amin: Sleep well love
23/07/17, 16:10 - Janith: What exactly is the something we're arguing about?
23/07/17, 16:11 - Janith: Also I don't believe in things without logical proof
23/07/17, 16:11 - Amin: Lets skip arguing part
23/07/17, 16:11 - Amin: What is logical?
23/07/17, 16:11 - Spaceexplorer: Whats your definition of logical proof?
23/07/17, 16:11 - Amin: Nice 👍
23/07/17, 16:12 - Amin: Actually I wonder
23/07/17, 16:12 - Amin: Why am I talking here instead of tinder

23/07/17, 16:12 - Amin: Bbye fellas👋👋
23/07/17, 16:12 - Arne: Logical proof: a theory that can be realistic if compared with stuff we already know?
23/07/17, 16:13 - Spaceexplorer: That makes me wonder...
What is realistic?
23/07/17, 16:14 - Janith: Et tu @27724236778 ?😭😭😭
23/07/17, 16:14 - Didier: Thanks to amin hahaha

23/07/17, 16:19 - Arne: Then you would like Amin too. Ugly af
23/07/17, 16:19 - Amin: Life is a bicycle dude, for having balance, u should go on
23/07/17, 16:19 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😆😆
23/07/17, 16:19 - Amin: Einestein
23/07/17, 16:19 - Didier: Hahaha
23/07/17, 16:20 - Amin: 😂😂😂🙏🙏
23/07/17, 16:20 - Janith: @27724236778 If god can be an uncaused creator then why can't the universe be uncaused?
23/07/17, 16:20 - Didier: Someone is being mean to Amin 😂
23/07/17, 16:21 - Amin: Arne is a lovely person 😅 he can be mean to me
23/07/17, 16:21 - Arne: Just joking around
23/07/17, 16:21 - Janith: The argument contradicts itself @27724236778
23/07/17, 16:21 - Didier: I already know haha
23/07/17, 16:21 - Didier: Love jokes
23/07/17, 16:21 - Amin: If I was a girl, I would have loved him for ever, seriously, or if he was gay 😅
23/07/17, 16:21 - Didier: Because Amin is a joke
23/07/17, 16:22 - Amin: I am actually a clone
23/07/17, 16:22 - Janith: Apologies if I seem kinda irritable today guys. I just dealt with a bible thumper
23/07/17, 16:22 - Amin: I tell jokes
23/07/17, 16:22 - Didier: HMM Look at him Arne
23/07/17, 16:22 - Didier: R u intwrested?
23/07/17, 16:22 - Spaceexplorer: Havnt we traced back the universe to a point of non existence?
Forcing it to be caused?
23/07/17, 16:22 - Amin: Hate those guys 😅
23/07/17, 16:22 - Arne: Sorry not gay, I think.
23/07/17, 16:23 - Amin: 😅😅😅
23/07/17, 16:23 - Didier: Hahaha
23/07/17, 16:23 - Arne: In real life I suck at making jokes. Lucky for me my father is worse
23/07/17, 16:23 - Didier: Dun worry Amin,u still have a chance (maybe)
23/07/17, 16:23 - Amin: Such a shame 😅
23/07/17, 16:23 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
23/07/17, 16:23 - Amin: I have tinder
23/07/17, 16:24 - Didier: Whatsapp is the new tinder
23/07/17, 16:24 - Didier: Wait,but what is a bible thumperm
23/07/17, 16:24 - Didier: We don't have such terms here
23/07/17, 16:24 - Janith: A point of non-existence doesn't necassarily mean it must be caused. Even if that was the case then the god that created the universe must have a cause. The arguments begins by saying that whatever exists has a cause
23/07/17, 16:24 - Didier: I think I might know what it means
23/07/17, 16:25 - Amin: 😂😂😂
23/07/17, 16:25 - Janith: Someone I want to shove feet first into an industrial meat grinder
23/07/17, 16:25 - Didier: Forget it Amin,just go back to tinder
23/07/17, 16:25 - Amin: Some sons of bitches trying to force religion
23/07/17, 16:26 - Didier: Then I was right haha
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Religion should not be forced
23/07/17, 16:26 - Didier: Yeah they are annoying
23/07/17, 16:26 - Spaceexplorer: True,it does not nessesarily mean that ...
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Religion should not be forced
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Religion should not be forced
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Religion should not be forced
23/07/17, 16:26 - Didier: Yeah
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Religion should not be forced
23/07/17, 16:26 - Arne: There is indeed no end nor a beginning of all. 
Just like time. Suprising: I first heard of it in a epic fantasy book/serie.
23/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Its the only place that I get angry
23/07/17, 16:26 - Arne: Tell that to the history of Islam?
23/07/17, 16:27 - Amin: I can debate about Islam for hours, but never force nothing
23/07/17, 16:27 - Didier: I feel like religion is manipulated
23/07/17, 16:27 - Didier: Even without people realising
23/07/17, 16:27 - Amin: Who said that our prophet forced shit?
23/07/17, 16:27 - Janith: You never debate about Islam
23/07/17, 16:27 - Didier: As humans,we use things without realising
23/07/17, 16:28 - Didier: Whether for the good or bas
23/07/17, 16:28 - Didier: Bad
23/07/17, 16:28 - Janith: Yes. It is
23/07/17, 16:28 - Arne: Our history books.
23/07/17, 16:28 - Amin: Indeed, politicians misuse it alot
23/07/17, 16:28 - Janith: Especially because the shit is so vague
23/07/17, 16:28 - Amin: I always do
23/07/17, 16:28 - Janith: Preachers mainly
23/07/17, 16:28 - Arne: Tru
23/07/17, 16:28 - Janith: How?
23/07/17, 16:29 - Didier: I think he used to 😂
23/07/17, 16:29 - Arne: Last time you left the chat in the middle of a debate about islam/religion
23/07/17, 16:29 - Amin: I discuss it
23/07/17, 16:29 - Amin: I think janith were the one who leaved
23/07/17, 16:30 - Amin: I told him about the way you can reason unreasonable
23/07/17, 16:30 - Amin: And then he actually stopped being eager about it
23/07/17, 16:31 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sharia?

23/07/17, 16:31 - Amin: Is what real?

23/07/17, 16:32 - Amin: Do you mean sheea jash?
23/07/17, 16:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not shea or Sunni
23/07/17, 16:32 - Amin: Shee' e / sonni?
23/07/17, 16:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Idk what they exactly are but it's not them

23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: With laws
23/07/17, 16:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh
23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: The answer could be very diffrent
23/07/17, 16:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly
23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: But Whatever
23/07/17, 16:39 - Arne: Making laws. Having a group of "police" who can make you force to the laws
23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: 😂😂
23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: Exactly
23/07/17, 16:39 - Amin: Ok
23/07/17, 16:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But it's still a thing right
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: Religion in Islam
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: View
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: Let me correct
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: Religion in muslims view
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: Need to be expanded
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: To islamic rules
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: And enforced
23/07/17, 16:40 - Amin: By governments
23/07/17, 16:41 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
23/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: These rules are sharia laws
23/07/17, 16:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh
23/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: So sexy
23/07/17, 16:41 - Amin: Dudes

23/07/17, 16:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Accidentally slipped out or something? 😂
23/07/17, 16:48 - Tel: Hm, religion is naturally being alienated amongst educated populations. And the world has laws outside of religion, therefore religion isn't needed. 

Religion was useful centuries / millenia ago when sufficient control systems didn't exist, or where the population were uneducated. But that's increasingly not the case, ergo religion is less useful.

23/07/17, 18:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you could have an exact copy of yourself , would it still matter to you if you had to suicide? I mean you will continue existing, because it s actually only your body producing the anxiety to protect your body 🤔
23/07/17, 18:54 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: If I could have an exact copy of myself but that copy is still not me we may have same opinion or feeling on same thing but I can't feel what she feels I can't experience what she experiences that's what matters to me 🤔
23/07/17, 18:54 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I still wanna see the future hahahah
23/07/17, 18:57 - Juancho: Me too.

23/07/17, 18:58 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I would marry her😂
23/07/17, 19:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But if it s the same entity
23/07/17, 19:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s not really you who dies, but only one version of you
23/07/17, 19:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I mean
23/07/17, 19:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You re all Intps you dont believe in a soul,do you?
23/07/17, 19:07 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: "You" will see the future 😁
23/07/17, 19:09 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Well different brain, different eyes
23/07/17, 19:09 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Like 2 Nokia 3310
23/07/17, 19:11 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Identical but still 2 separate stuff
23/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you destroy one
23/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Nothing is lost
23/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If it s the exact same thing
23/07/17, 19:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s weird to think about
23/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Because this self-conscious thing is very deep inside ous
23/07/17, 19:13 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: From external view yes. From internal view, no
23/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: It's about my own experience not that of that identical me, which I don't really care about.
23/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Well
23/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you have 2 me's
23/07/17, 19:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And shut one off
23/07/17, 19:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It should be like a transportation
23/07/17, 19:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Because
23/07/17, 19:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You wont care anymorw when you re dead
23/07/17, 19:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And the memory will continue in the other
23/07/17, 19:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Because we re just bodies, know what i mean?
23/07/17, 19:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: The  same  experience continues just somewhere else
23/07/17, 19:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And somewhere else you will be self conscious again
23/07/17, 19:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Because this unique "you" doesnt really exist
23/07/17, 19:17 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Can't agree
23/07/17, 19:18 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: As I said, 2 bodies, 2 brains, different experiences tho will have same feeling or opinion
23/07/17, 19:19 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Hmmm
23/07/17, 19:19 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Like you copy yourself by dna, still two separate bodies
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I was thinking
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: An exact copy
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: And my brain is stuck to my body not that copied one, we both function but still not same
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Like 2 3310s as I mentioned
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah
23/07/17, 19:20 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Exactly same but still separate
23/07/17, 19:21 - Maureen: like a clone?
23/07/17, 19:21 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Yup
23/07/17, 19:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah a clone with the same experiences as you few moments before you die
23/07/17, 19:21 - Maureen: two bodies and two brains would mean they have a connection
23/07/17, 19:22 - Maureen: like identical twins?!
23/07/17, 19:22 - Juancho: Of course not.
23/07/17, 19:22 - Maureen: I believe in a soul
23/07/17, 19:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont want to be disrespectful so I m just gonna stick to my theory :/ it s just sad i can t explain it better
23/07/17, 19:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: That i cant*
23/07/17, 19:23 - Maureen: can you explain it to me in private in german?
23/07/17, 19:23 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Me too, I believe in soul. science can't explain doesn't mean it doesn't exist as human are just too stupid
23/07/17, 19:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I can try 😂
23/07/17, 19:24 - Maureen: exactly
23/07/17, 19:25 - Maureen: we can't see the soul, we can't explain it. but there is something that makes us us
23/07/17, 19:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I think the opposite
23/07/17, 19:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Soul is an easy explanation for people because they re too dumb to differentiate a self conscious brain from being external to your body and using it like a puppet
23/07/17, 19:29 - Maureen: I believe in the age of a soul
23/07/17, 19:29 - Maureen: like I'm an old soul
23/07/17, 19:30 - Maureen: there are 5 stages
23/07/17, 19:30 - Maureen: and your personality depends on your souls age
23/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I believe in the flying spaghetti monster
23/07/17, 19:40 - FABIO: 👆
23/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I think just wording difference. Soul = self conscious brain. If that external brain doesn't have physical form. Hope I don't have any misunderstanding.
23/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Lol
23/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: To me soul is something that you cant find in a body 😂
23/07/17, 19:41 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Something that transcends the physical realm
23/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I believe that everything with physical properties, no matter how complex can be recreated
23/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Hahaha as you said external so I just assumed it's outside our body
23/07/17, 19:45 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Soul can have physical property as well otherwise I can't be seen (ghost)
23/07/17, 19:45 - Maureen: have you read "his dark materials"?
23/07/17, 19:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I have a new theory, what do you think about it? The more we let AI and robots into our word the more we will see our imperfections and destroy ourselves(not the actual machines)
23/07/17, 19:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: World*
23/07/17, 19:46 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Nope
23/07/17, 19:46 - Maureen: there's a universe in which the soul is a spirit animal
23/07/17, 19:47 - Maureen: they live with their humans and can't be separated. well they can but it will hurt both. the animal will die and the human will go into a zombie like state
23/07/17, 19:47 - Maureen: true for most western people
23/07/17, 19:48 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I think it's depends as I has already know I'm imperfect already it can't really hurt me🤔
23/07/17, 19:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Lol
23/07/17, 19:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m so sorry
23/07/17, 19:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I missclicked a few times
23/07/17, 19:49 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: 😆😆
23/07/17, 19:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
23/07/17, 19:50 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I think so of them claim they can let there so comes out of there body?
23/07/17, 19:50 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: https://youtu.be/PnV5zZJxhK8 just leaving this here 😬
23/07/17, 19:50 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Some *
23/07/17, 19:51 - Maureen: no, it's not actual animals but spirits in animal form. while kids being kids those dæmons - as they are called - can shift. they take a constant form when kids hit puberty
23/07/17, 19:52 - Maureen: so people are born with dæmons and they feel each other. they are best friends. when the human dies the dæmon goes into the universe
23/07/17, 19:53 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: If they can feel each other, it wouldn't be that hard to understand other's feeling as an Intp lol
23/07/17, 19:53 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: 😆😆
23/07/17, 19:54 - Maureen: it's in the second book that a girl with dæmon meets a boy from our universe. both find out that the only difference is that his soul is inside and her soul is her dæmon
23/07/17, 19:54 - Maureen: dude, what would I give for someone to understand me the way I want to be understood
23/07/17, 19:56 - Juancho: Let me set something straight here.
23/07/17, 19:56 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I'm a girl 😕
23/07/17, 19:57 - Maureen: i use "dude" as a gender neutral pronoun
23/07/17, 19:57 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Haha okay
23/07/17, 19:58 - Maureen: I'm not 😂😂😂😂
23/07/17, 19:58 - Maureen: sorry 🏳‍🌈
23/07/17, 19:59 - Juancho: When you're in an INTP group, don't expect INTPs to tread lightly. We will support the most logical argument/side in any debate or discussion, does it offend you?/does it bother you?/do you disagree (please provide arguments)?/does it contradict your beliefs? Well, we don't give af. Don't like it, then leave. If this applies to you you are most likely not an INTP.
23/07/17, 19:59 - Juancho: Hahahahaha.
23/07/17, 20:11 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I think INTP don't give af on rules? 🤔🤔
23/07/17, 20:11 - Juancho: Ohh and we don't.
23/07/17, 20:12 - Juancho: But this one is logical and essential for the welfare of our community (this group).

24/07/17, 00:42 - Arne: I think that what makes us us, is that what is also in our cells, I don't know the exact number of genes in our cells, but compared with the total of it, it is just 25% or so in every chromosome!
24/07/17, 00:44 - Amin: Number of genes
24/07/17, 00:44 - Amin: Ok dude the first point is

24/07/17, 01:12 - Imeldaroswara: Don't remember where I heard/read it from..

24/07/17, 02:16 - Amin: Monogomy and polygomy
24/07/17, 02:17 - Amin: I think first is that every one should have one
24/07/17, 02:17 - Amin: Second is that every one should have one is wrong
24/07/17, 02:17 - Amin: U can taste different opposite sex
24/07/17, 02:17 - Amin: In the same time
24/07/17, 02:18 - Amin: Indeed my defs are not accurate

24/07/17, 08:08 - Tel: This one
24/07/17, 09:17 - Didier: Monogamy and polygamy*
24/07/17, 09:22 - Janith: Grammar nazi 😆
24/07/17, 09:24 - Didier: I think that saying religion isn't needed is generally true.I think that religion shouldn't be brought into arguments.I think that it's fine to bring it into debate instead.Though religion isn't necessary,some might need it as an escape/a comfort/to respect/maybe even to just read.I think religion is just a personal thing.Don't bring it into politics.When there are others who believe in the same religion,it's fine.If u don't believe it,it's fine too.Don't force,always be open.U can not believe in a religion yet seek it.For example,I'm a Catholic,I don't necessarily buy the story but I just like to read it.That connection.That insight.
24/07/17, 09:24 - Didier: Haha no just helping him 😂
24/07/17, 09:25 - Didier: Buy the story as in I don't believe it
24/07/17, 09:25 - Janith: The thing is that religion right now has a ton of baggage with it from less civilized areas of our existence
24/07/17, 09:25 - Didier: Yeah haha
24/07/17, 09:25 - Didier: Those savages
24/07/17, 09:25 - Didier: We people need to learm how to be civilized
24/07/17, 09:26 - Janith: It would be easier to start fresh with a new set of beliefs than work to adjust the old ones to a new climate
24/07/17, 09:29 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: <Mídia omitida>

24/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: What I actually do is a bit different in my case
24/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I never played that game😂
24/07/17, 09:31 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Never?

24/07/17, 09:32 - Didier: Yeah 😂
24/07/17, 09:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Other introverts think we're weird
24/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: Haha yeahh
24/07/17, 09:33 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Tried to ... Once. Didn't get it. WA not intresting
24/07/17, 09:33 - Didier: It gets interesting when u get it

24/07/17, 09:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's a time consumer that somewhat entertains
24/07/17, 09:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Then why should I play it ???
24/07/17, 09:34 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am not gonna play that
24/07/17, 09:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's a better alternative to boredom

24/07/17, 09:38 - Didier: Finger reflexes 😂 as well as how alert u are
24/07/17, 09:38 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Exactly
24/07/17, 09:38 - Didier: I'? not alert so...

24/07/17, 10:31 - Amin: thanks
24/07/17, 10:34 - Amin: wrong for me
24/07/17, 10:34 - Amin: new question
24/07/17, 10:35 - Amin: how much do you care what others think about you ?
24/07/17, 10:35 - Amin: and how much that affects your deeds ?
24/07/17, 10:35 - Maureen: less than as a teenager
24/07/17, 10:36 - Amin: does that mean very few?
24/07/17, 10:36 - Maureen: but I'm a person people tend to like
24/07/17, 10:36 - Amin: tend to like what?
24/07/17, 10:36 - Maureen: mostly I don't care
24/07/17, 10:37 - Maureen: me
24/07/17, 10:38 - Amin: oh, u mostly care about what YOU think, not what others think, did I get u right?
24/07/17, 10:38 - Maureen: yes 🙂
24/07/17, 10:38 - Amin: hmmm, how about how much people like you?
24/07/17, 10:38 - Maureen: tho I want people to not care too 😂
24/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: I don't even know
24/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: I'm friendly 99% of the time
24/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: I'm a happy and calm person
24/07/17, 10:39 - Amin: hmmm, so mostly, people like you, right?
24/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: yes
24/07/17, 10:40 - Maureen: and the others are annoyed by me 😂
24/07/17, 10:40 - Amin: what if some one doesnt, how that makes you feel?
24/07/17, 10:40 - Maureen: but I don't care
24/07/17, 10:40 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I dun give a fuck anymore as I know myself best.
24/07/17, 10:40 - Maureen: 🙏🏻
24/07/17, 10:41 - Amin: ok, does a person who doesn't like you, scares you?
24/07/17, 10:41 - Amin: like you may think about the ways they can hurt you depended on the situation you are in?
24/07/17, 10:43 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Nope, can't be bothered it's their problem you can't control
24/07/17, 10:44 - Amin: Let me rephrase
24/07/17, 10:44 - Amin: Are you scared of people?
24/07/17, 10:44 - Amin: The reason Im saying that, is because I am
24/07/17, 10:44 - Amin: .
24/07/17, 10:45 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Why would you scare of people 🤔
24/07/17, 10:46 - Amin: For example, I think when I say my views on something, In my head I think others find me cold, and they may not like me, so they may hurt me
24/07/17, 10:46 - Amin: The question is how?
24/07/17, 10:46 - Amin: There is a possibility that they cant right now, but what if they find a way in future?
24/07/17, 10:47 - Amin: And hurt me then?
24/07/17, 10:48 - Amin: That makes me like not to talk at all, so no one can do shit
24/07/17, 10:48 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: You can tell whether they are mind fucked when you talk to them. I'd just stay away from them.
24/07/17, 10:49 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Hahaha that's why I listen more than I talk
24/07/17, 10:49 - Amin: Iranian people are very much like americans
24/07/17, 10:49 - Amin: I guess
24/07/17, 10:49 - Amin: Selfish
24/07/17, 10:50 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I have no idea on Iranian and American😆😆
24/07/17, 10:50 - Maureen: well I know that I have different views so I understand them and that makes me care less
24/07/17, 10:50 - Amin: Sry for generalizing
24/07/17, 10:50 - Maureen: I'm only scared of crowded places
24/07/17, 10:50 - Amin: It was hard not to generalize in this case
24/07/17, 10:52 - Amin: It is your view about people
24/07/17, 10:52 - Amin: Why?
24/07/17, 10:59 - Maureen: but when I know how they might react I can't be bothered. I'm prepared
24/07/17, 10:59 - Maureen: because people exhause me
24/07/17, 11:00 - Maureen: in my everyday life I get physically tired after long hours if being around people with not many time to rest
24/07/17, 11:01 - Maureen: *much

24/07/17, 12:18 - Tel: As in I understand your points, but not re reference to Muslims still.
24/07/17, 12:30 - Tel: Haha ok
24/07/17, 12:36 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 12:38 - Tel: Hm, does any particular type of interaction give you energy, though? I find that handing around other N types gives me energy, as I'm extroverting my N and they respond in kind / 'get' it
24/07/17, 12:38 - Tel: S types are the ones that exhaust me
24/07/17, 12:49 - Maureen: yes but I don't associate people with their types
24/07/17, 12:49 - Shaiju: I am already exhausted.... I think that the outer word is too difficult for my inner world...  I think we lack a lot in the F department to adjust .... The most difficult part is most of the people around is E. :(
24/07/17, 12:50 - Maureen: I've learned that a lot of people who I would have said they were an extrovert are really a good passing introvert
24/07/17, 12:51 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: I have a hard time with SJ's (most J's actually), but I adore SP's. I feed of their Se, and attempt to live in the present with them.

24/07/17, 12:52 - Shaiju: +💯
24/07/17, 12:53 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yup.. they're soul crushers .
24/07/17, 12:53 - Maureen: can you guys point on people saying: "You exhaust me" and "you give me energy?" despite what type they may be?
24/07/17, 12:53 - Maureen: 💯
24/07/17, 12:55 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yes, but this has more to do with if the person is in a health place or not. Less to do with type I think.
24/07/17, 13:19 - Amin: The part u know how they might react needs more explaanation
24/07/17, 13:20 - Amin: What do you mean by exhause?
24/07/17, 13:20 - Shaiju: I always think whether are we (INTP) all pretentious imposters with inflated self image and think that our ideas are worth more than others and we things see clearly.  Are we really trying to hide what we are lacking? At the end of the day,the goal of life is to be happy, isn't it? Are we able to do that with our over compensating badgery? 🙄🤔🙃😪😂
24/07/17, 13:21 - Maureen: for me it's not. so you need to specify what exactly you need to know
24/07/17, 13:21 - Shaiju: *sorry for the syntax and symantex
24/07/17, 13:21 - Maureen: they suck my energy
24/07/17, 13:21 - Amin: So by this explanation work exhaust u, and also it looks irrelevant to the fact that crowded places scares you
24/07/17, 13:21 - Shaiju: I just didn't reread..it has misplaced words during typing...
24/07/17, 13:22 - Amin: Ok,  thats because u are introverted
24/07/17, 13:22 - Maureen: no, not work. it's about people
24/07/17, 13:23 - Maureen: "tired after long hours [of] being around people with not [much] time to rest"
24/07/17, 13:23 - Amin: So no matter if u r  tired from work or not, people exhaust u
24/07/17, 13:23 - Maureen: yes
24/07/17, 13:23 - Amin: Introverted people are like this
24/07/17, 13:23 - Maureen: I know
24/07/17, 13:24 - Maureen: that's why I know when to rest
24/07/17, 13:24 - Amin: Well, U didnt tell me, why crowded people scare u?
24/07/17, 13:24 - Amin: Places*
24/07/17, 13:25 - Maureen: because. I. get. exhausted. easily.
I. don't. like. exhaustion.
24/07/17, 13:25 - Maureen: I like being full of energy
24/07/17, 13:25 - Maureen: the more crowded the less energy I have
24/07/17, 13:25 - Amin: So you are scared of exhaustion, right?
24/07/17, 13:26 - Maureen: that's one point
24/07/17, 13:26 - Maureen: I also have agoraphobia
24/07/17, 13:26 - Amin: Let me google it first
24/07/17, 13:26 - Amin: Brb
24/07/17, 13:26 - Maureen: but that's another topic
24/07/17, 13:26 - Maureen: there's a lot of shit online
24/07/17, 13:26 - Maureen: because there's an older definition that's not true anymore
24/07/17, 13:27 - Amin: Ok wait
24/07/17, 13:27 - Amin: Before we get to agoraphobia
24/07/17, 13:28 - Amin: If you are scared of exhaustion
24/07/17, 13:28 - Amin: Are u afraid of physical exhaustion or mental one?0
24/07/17, 13:29 - Shaiju: Now you are exhausting her energy...😂
24/07/17, 13:29 - Maureen: thank you
24/07/17, 13:29 - Amin: Do you want to talk to me instead? 😅
24/07/17, 13:30 - Amin: Oh where are my manners?
24/07/17, 13:30 - Shaiju: Ha ha.. sorry... I don't have much energy left... May be some other time... :)

24/07/17, 13:33 - Maureen: 😘
24/07/17, 13:33 - Amin: I didn't bother, what do u mean by we? And what can you take?  Whats just about exhaustion? What is diffrent?

24/07/17, 13:38 - Amin: I promise I wont fuck you
24/07/17, 13:38 - Amin: Am I your man? 😅 good, like always
24/07/17, 13:38 - Tel: 🤘🏻
24/07/17, 13:41 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Okay, yes. I struggle with coming across as both condescending and insecure. Condescending and I "just get it" and can be tactless when explaining to others what they're not getting. And insecure as I feel alienated by my Ti, unable to just enjoy life. All types have their struggles though, and we all just want to belong and connect.
24/07/17, 13:44 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Good one 😏I'm Mistee, 23, and I live in Montana

24/07/17, 13:46 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Precisely, also I have to remind myself that SJ's are people (with probably original thought?), not just mindless-procedure machines.
24/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: So u have problem being alone, right?
24/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: Are u a male or a female?
24/07/17, 13:48 - Maureen: very important question 😂
24/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: I find that true too
24/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: Hey lovely maureen, welcome back
24/07/17, 13:49 - Maureen: I was out of the conversation we had befire
24/07/17, 13:49 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: By we, I mean all humans want to connect. 
And nah, alone is v comfortable for me. 
And I'm a female.. the rare INTP woman I know
24/07/17, 13:49 - Maureen: I love to watch
24/07/17, 13:49 - Maureen: sometimes give a comment
24/07/17, 13:50 - Tel: Ruddy interesting insight @918123428275. I feel the same.. But then revisit my logic and find it quite hard to justify the negative self perception. Sometimes I'm wrong, sure, but not as much as society thinks.. Therefore I think that this observation is more indicative of an acceptance of society's judgement of us based on a lack of understanding of our characteristics. 

Also - same re condescending, etc. Developing your Fe helps with this, or simply openly acknowledging it and explaining that you don't mean to. This allows you to take ownership of it and be humble about your known (and allowable!) weaknesses, whilst also appeasing whoever may feel you're being condescending. At least, that's what works for me. 

Ti also is alienating for me, but my former comment helps re self analysis. Even better than this is finding other N types (INFJs are great friends for INTPs I think) that you can bounce things off and gain constructive criticism from. ENTJs are also good, but I take them more with a pinch of salt as they can be a bit too SJ like I find, despite functions being exactly the same except introvert / extrovert switch H.
24/07/17, 13:50 - Tel: Sorry re essay
24/07/17, 13:50 - Amin: Cool, so ur problem is that you cant enjoy life, right?
24/07/17, 13:51 - Tel: Yup, true. Sometimes quite hard.. I have a best friend who's an ISTJ and we work well together as we're aware.. An unaware partnership is freaking hard, though, as it leads to I'll thought through judgement. At least, that's my hypothesis
24/07/17, 13:52 - Tel: And personal findings.
24/07/17, 13:52 - Amin: Oh God, you use alot of words
24/07/17, 13:52 - Tel: 😂
24/07/17, 13:52 - Tel: I promise I'm not an ENTP..
24/07/17, 13:53 - Amin: Mbti is a corporate test
24/07/17, 13:53 - Tel: Or you mean diff words? Sorry. I forget that this is an international group
24/07/17, 13:53 - Amin: And if you take it 5 times, 5 diffrent results is possible
24/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: No, I am good in english
24/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: At*
24/07/17, 13:54 - Tel: Hm, it isn't a test, it's an indicator.. As in, it reflects how you answered. It's meant to be followed up with a 1:1 with a practitioner, which is where you decide what you actually are
24/07/17, 13:54 - Tel: So, the indicator can always come out diff.. But the end result shouldn't
24/07/17, 13:55 - Tel: Depends on your level of self awareness though, as ever.
24/07/17, 13:55 - Amin: Whats the diffrence between indicator and test?
24/07/17, 13:56 - Tel: Test means you get a definitive result.. You either pass or you fail is the implication
24/07/17, 13:57 - Tel: Indicator means it is highlighting that you are a particular type, but you may not be (indicated embeds uncertainty, whereas test doesn't)
24/07/17, 13:57 - Tel: It's a little semantic, but there's a good rationale for the difference
24/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: Hmm got u
24/07/17, 13:58 - Tel: :)
24/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: Ok, so there is a test and there is a function
24/07/17, 13:59 - Amin: Tel, you believe you are an intp right?
24/07/17, 13:59 - Tel: Yup, I know I am rather than believe
24/07/17, 13:59 - Tel: Or, I guess, I am not uncertain based on existing evidence.
24/07/17, 14:00 - Tel: Haha
24/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: When u believe some thing, do you doubt it?
24/07/17, 14:00 - Tel: Yup
24/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Is there uncertainty in believe?
24/07/17, 14:02 - Didier: U can
24/07/17, 14:02 - Didier: Doubt ur own beliefs
24/07/17, 14:02 - Tel: The indicator initially said I was am ENTJ, but I knew I wasn't an E so I figured I was an INTJ. I knew I wasn't well organised in the J sense, but stuck with it as some ppl I respect are in INTJs. It influenced me.. 

After deeper analysis with a practitioner, I settled fully on INTP. I still test it every now and then, but I am sure based on what I know
24/07/17, 14:02 - Didier: Especially as an INFP
24/07/17, 14:02 - Amin: Does believe have uncertainty by nature?
24/07/17, 14:02 - Tel: Hm, well, I used diff language to belief. That's your word ;)
24/07/17, 14:03 - Didier: It depends on what kind of belief
24/07/17, 14:03 - Didier: But since u can't believe in something completely,I would say yes
24/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: Dude, you say alot
24/07/17, 14:03 - Tel: 😂
24/07/17, 14:03 - Didier: Tel?
24/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Can you stay focused on know and believe thing?
24/07/17, 14:04 - Tel: Hahaha! Sure
24/07/17, 14:04 - Didier: on know?
24/07/17, 14:04 - Tel: Think so
24/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Hello lovely didier, welcome back, yes
24/07/17, 14:04 - Didier: Hi ^^
24/07/17, 14:04 - Tel: Trying to explain and give my insights for discussion. I'll shut up more ;)
24/07/17, 14:05 - Didier: Lol
24/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: Ok does believe contain uncertainty in its nature?
24/07/17, 14:05 - Didier: Phrase it properly?
24/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: 👆👆👆👆
24/07/17, 14:06 - Amin: 👆👆👆
24/07/17, 14:06 - Amin: 👆👆👆👆
24/07/17, 14:06 - Tel: Hm. Good q
24/07/17, 14:06 - Didier: Haha
24/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: So you believe u are an intp and you know that you are an intp are diffrent or not?
24/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: Answer mw
24/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: Me*
24/07/17, 14:07 - Tel: I don't know. But I like the certainty in other words more.
24/07/17, 14:07 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Actually I clashed horribly with the only INFJ I've allowed into my life. We dated very briefly, he felt "understood" by me, (something I've read is important to INFJ's) probably due to my Ti. And I was amazing by his Fe function.  I often find solace in INFP and ENTP's company.
24/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: Ok
24/07/17, 14:07 - Tel: Oo that's a good q and I don't know the answer.
24/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Ok
24/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: So lets go to the next step
24/07/17, 14:08 - Tel: Wait
24/07/17, 14:08 - Tel: Belief is not based on evidence
24/07/17, 14:08 - Tel: So, yea, it's less certain that what I said
24/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Do you know entps are most introverted extroverts?
24/07/17, 14:08 - Didier: Because they r two separate things,if they are considered as factors  alone,then no.But if we add in human nature,yes,whether the uncertainty is strong or not in something someone believes depends on the individual.It's because we r not absolute about our beliefs that we can change them little by little.
24/07/17, 14:09 - Tel: Therefore it should have built in uncertainty, as you don't know - by my personal scale of credibility, if that makes sense
24/07/17, 14:09 - Didier: Because it's a belief,it will be more biased (self-oriented) and this beliefs compared to non-beliefs will have less uncertainty to u
24/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: Yeah, know is a stronger word than believe
24/07/17, 14:10 - Didier: That's how u believe it too
24/07/17, 14:10 - Tel: The functions are ordered differently, though - Ne and Ti are switched. Makes for a big difference
24/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: In the context of certainty
24/07/17, 14:10 - Tel: Said it better than I could. That ks @6582280971
24/07/17, 14:10 - Tel: Thanks*
24/07/17, 14:11 - Didier: Either enfp or entp
24/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: You told me you think u are introverted
24/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: But test told you that you are extroverted
24/07/17, 14:12 - Tel: Indicator* 😉
24/07/17, 14:12 - Tel: By +1 on a scale of +/-25
24/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: Wait
24/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: I should go
24/07/17, 14:12 - Tel: K
24/07/17, 14:12 - Didier: Btw extrovert does not mean loud and sociable,and introvert does not mean quiet and unsociable
24/07/17, 14:12 - Didier: I know many sociable introverts
24/07/17, 14:13 - Amin: Sry
24/07/17, 14:13 - Didier: Infjs,isfjs
24/07/17, 14:13 - Amin: Hope we can continue later
24/07/17, 14:13 - Tel: Ah, continue later Amin?
24/07/17, 14:13 - Amin: Bye for now
24/07/17, 14:13 - Tel: Yea, defo do!
24/07/17, 14:13 - Tel: Am interested in your thought process
24/07/17, 14:13 - Didier: And I know quiet extroverts and extroverts who stick to a smaller group
24/07/17, 14:13 - Didier: How u can tell
24/07/17, 14:13 - Didier: Extroverts-comfortable with going out more
24/07/17, 14:14 - Didier: Introverts the opposite
24/07/17, 14:14 - Tel: Yup. I think it's more re cog functions rather than I or E. My Ne is my extrovert outlet. Amin is intriguing as he's querying the order of cog functions though, I think, as these are only slight differences re ENTP and INTP.
24/07/17, 14:15 - Didier: Hmm I know an entp online
24/07/17, 14:15 - Didier: I can tell the difference between entp and intp
24/07/17, 14:16 - Didier: But I haven't gotten to know u enough haha
24/07/17, 14:16 - Didier: Let me see what I can find first
24/07/17, 14:16 - Arne: Name more differents
24/07/17, 14:17 - Tel: Haha :p
24/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: I think of extroversion/introversion as in where one processes. Extrovert: bounces new ideas off the outside world to come to a conclusion, introverts look internally when presented with new information.
24/07/17, 14:17 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 14:17 - Tel: I'd suggest focusing more on cog functions rather than one dichotomy. One dichotomy can be wrong simply because you're observing their extroverted auxiliary function.. Like our Ne
24/07/17, 14:18 - Didier: I underdstand
24/07/17, 14:18 - Tel: Yea, that's a good eg
24/07/17, 14:18 - Didier: Like how I came to the conclusion that my fav character is intj 😂
24/07/17, 14:19 - Didier: Btw tel
24/07/17, 14:19 - Didier: Do u know that I'm an infp here?Don't mind me though haha
24/07/17, 14:19 - Tel: Haha coolio. I didn't, but that's cool. I'm not typist.. :p

24/07/17, 14:21 - Didier: OPP?
24/07/17, 14:21 - Tel: Hm, the EU certifying body for mbti practitioners
24/07/17, 14:21 - Tel: As in, only they can certify you to become a practitioner
24/07/17, 14:22 - Tel: They've recently merged with CPP in the USA
24/07/17, 14:22 - Didier: Oh,I do wanna learn that someday!
24/07/17, 14:22 - Didier: We don't have that here so
24/07/17, 14:22 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Exactly
24/07/17, 14:23 - Arne: I might be ENTP 🤔
24/07/17, 14:23 - Tel: Yea, it's really good. Ruddy expensive though - nearly £4k GBP. Get work to pay ;)
24/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: What does Ruddy mean?
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: I feel that this is true
24/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: From personal experience
24/07/17, 14:24 - Tel: Ruddy = it's an exclamation. Like very.. It's a way I say 'bloody expensive' without saying 'bloody'.. :p
24/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: That's...
24/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: Why so expensive
24/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: I notice intps are better at thinking through something than entps
24/07/17, 14:27 - Tel: Monopoly I guess. Plus practitioners can charge a lot to do. It with someone
24/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: Therefore,intps are more logical
24/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: What website is this from??
24/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: www.google.com.sg/amp/thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/05/18-telling-differences-between-entp-and-intp-personality-types/amp/
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: I like entps,but they aren't nearly as logical an the intp
24/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Thank you😁
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: They failed me,an infp haha
24/07/17, 14:28 - Tel: Lol
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: Are u new?
24/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: But! They make great adventure partners, being a bit more spontaneous
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: Entps are fun to be with though
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: They are more comfortable with crowds
24/07/17, 14:28 - Didier: Not awkward like the intp
24/07/17, 14:29 - Didier: Yup of course
24/07/17, 14:29 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Nah, I pop in every once in a while, usually to just read the convo
24/07/17, 14:29 - Didier: No wonder
24/07/17, 14:29 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Where are you from??
24/07/17, 14:30 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: As an INFP, what drew you to this groups text?
24/07/17, 14:30 - Didier: Though entps are always follow a group of people,they tend to feel they do not belong
24/07/17, 14:31 - Didier: I was able to relate to the INTP.Plus,it intrigues me.What do INTPs discuss?What would happen if u switch the thinking and feeling preference?
24/07/17, 14:31 - Didier: How do they fit into this world?
24/07/17, 14:31 - Didier: How do they look like in society?
24/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: While intps will be more alone?Because of the Ti,and they do have the need to constantly be with others
24/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: do not*
24/07/17, 14:33 - Didier: While entps feel that they do not belong as they are in a group,intps probably won't bother as muxh
24/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: From my experience
24/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: much*
24/07/17, 14:34 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: My best best friend is an INFP. I don't understand how she Feels things, and but I value it.
24/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: We feel things very deeply
24/07/17, 14:34 - Didier: No matter how much we want to deny it
24/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: And when I'm angry,I cry lol and I can't control it...
24/07/17, 14:35 - Tel: UK; London boy. You have a +1 number - USA? I'm in Atlanta / New Orleans next month! Might ask for any recommendations you may have :)
24/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: Whenever something happens,instead of a flashback of memories then feelings,there goes a flashback of feelings without even thinking about it
24/07/17, 14:35 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yep, sounds just like her😜
24/07/17, 14:35 - Didier: It's so immediate,so sudden,that's why u can't control it
24/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: Haha
24/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: Until now,it's a mystery to me
24/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: How does an infp's brain work?
24/07/17, 14:36 - Tel: Good idea. You in any other groups?
24/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: For the better or for the worse,both actually
24/07/17, 14:36 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Its disorienting for all persons involved lol
24/07/17, 14:36 - Didier: Nope.I wanted to tho 😂
24/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: That's why,just be there for ur friend haha
24/07/17, 14:37 - Tel: Do they just not exist?
24/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: As long as we know someone is sincere,we'll probably be happy
24/07/17, 14:37 - Didier: I never tried to search for them
24/07/17, 14:38 - Didier: I came across this group's invite link on pinterest too
24/07/17, 14:38 - Didier: Btw best best friend,does that mean she is the closest to u?
24/07/17, 14:51 - Didier: http://www.celebritytypes.com/test/entp-or-intp.php

@447903370497 Idk if this works,but u can give it a try
24/07/17, 14:51 - Didier: I found it on a forum
24/07/17, 14:58 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yes:) we "get" each other. We've been close since we were thirteen! So ten years
24/07/17, 14:59 - Didier: This confirms the theory that infps generally get along with intp!
24/07/17, 14:59 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yep, Montana USA. No where near New Orleans, but I have visited. Interesting place. What are ya going for?
24/07/17, 15:01 - Didier: Wow ten years...
24/07/17, 15:01 - Didier: Nice friendship 😂😭 all the best
24/07/17, 15:03 - Didier: Btw I just noticed something!All of u who despise xSFJs actuallh have the exact same cogntive functions as them,just that they are in different order.INTP's functions would be ESFJ's reversed.Same for ENTP's functions would be ISFJ's reversed.
24/07/17, 15:03 - Didier: Interesting how much the order can change everything
24/07/17, 15:04 - Didier: So xNTPs only have xSFJs for the same exact functions
24/07/17, 15:04 - Didier: On the other hand,infj and infp share no cognitive function and they get along well
24/07/17, 15:07 - Tel: Tried - not a fan of it tbh. It's an interesting thought discussion to be had..
24/07/17, 15:08 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 15:08 - Tel: Ironically (and coincidentally!) a Ti response rather than Ne :)
24/07/17, 15:08 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 15:08 - Arne: 🙄
24/07/17, 15:09 - Tel: Totally
24/07/17, 15:09 - Arne: All the time I made the MBTI test I received INTP. And now..
24/07/17, 15:09 - Didier: Hahaha
24/07/17, 15:09 - Tel: Mine said ENTP too. I'm not, though
24/07/17, 15:09 - Didier: The test was probably just to test out
24/07/17, 15:10 - Didier: Not to mention,they get along really well!
24/07/17, 15:10 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Exactly 💯 I have pondered this as well
24/07/17, 15:10 - Didier: Both idealists in nature
24/07/17, 15:10 - Arne: Hmm, I don't know it for sure. It seems to me that I can be both.
24/07/17, 15:10 - Didier: When the order is reversed,it calls for chaos 😂
24/07/17, 15:10 - Tel: Something for you to ponder on and figure out :)
24/07/17, 15:11 - Arne: 😬 I will. But not now
24/07/17, 15:11 - Arne: Tomorrow it's my birthday
24/07/17, 15:11 - Didier: Tomorrow as in the 26th?
24/07/17, 15:11 - Tel: Oo - happy bday in advance

24/07/17, 15:14 - Didier: I said this Amin
24/07/17, 15:14 - Maureen: are you allowed to wish an early birthday in the netherlands?
24/07/17, 15:15 - Maureen: in Germany it means bad luck
24/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Hahaha
24/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Didn't know that
24/07/17, 15:15 - Arne: Yeah. It doesn't have a bad meaning in the Netherlands.
24/07/17, 15:15 - Maureen: I'll wait for tomorrow nevertheless 😂
24/07/17, 15:15 - Didier: Germany likes to create stories
24/07/17, 15:16 - Arne: Haha.
24/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: Whether it is hitler or
24/07/17, 15:16 - Maureen: it's just bad luck
24/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: superstitions 😂
24/07/17, 15:16 - Amin: Hmmm, gimme time
24/07/17, 15:16 - Maureen: we are the homeland of creepy fairytales
24/07/17, 15:16 - Didier: It's 02:16 here so I consider it on time
24/07/17, 15:17 - Maureen: 😂

24/07/17, 15:17 - Arne: I gotta go too
24/07/17, 15:17 - Tel: Now I wonder whether someone wished him an early happy bday I'm the early 1920s....
24/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Thanks Arne byee :)
24/07/17, 15:18 - Maureen: he was Austrian thi
24/07/17, 15:18 - Maureen: tho
24/07/17, 15:18 - Didier: Good night
24/07/17, 15:18 - Tel: Ah, good point
24/07/17, 15:18 - Tel: Well, it was fun in my head while it lasted. A whole spoof of Hitler's early bday surprised
24/07/17, 15:18 - Tel: -d
24/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: 😂
24/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: Happy early birthday Hitler,we love you!
24/07/17, 15:19 - Maureen: I'd read the fic tho 😂
24/07/17, 15:19 - Didier: Imagine them saying that
24/07/17, 15:20 - Amin: Can you explain it!
?
24/07/17, 15:21 - Maureen: do you know the book "look who's back"?
24/07/17, 15:21 - Amin: 👋
24/07/17, 15:21 - Maureen: it's about Hitler waking up in todays Berlin
24/07/17, 15:22 - Maureen: totally not a fan of today's world
24/07/17, 15:22 - Maureen: especially neo nazis
24/07/17, 15:22 - Maureen: 😂
24/07/17, 15:22 - Amin: Night👋
24/07/17, 15:25 - Arne: Maureen
24/07/17, 15:25 - Maureen: Arne
24/07/17, 15:26 - Arne: I don't know where you live in Germany. But tomorrow and later, I heard theur gonna drop a lot of rain in that area
24/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: I'm in the south
24/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: it's raining for days
24/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: Friday was worst
24/07/17, 15:26 - Arne: Ahh
24/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: I don't know about tomorrow
24/07/17, 15:26 - Maureen: I just hope it doesn't end up in a flood
24/07/17, 15:27 - Arne: I just picked up from the TV :   
... "36h and 100mm of water, or so
24/07/17, 15:28 - Maureen: there was a flood in our area last year
24/07/17, 15:28 - Maureen: nobody needs that
24/07/17, 15:29 - Arne: That sucks
24/07/17, 15:29 - Maureen: my village is on a mountain, unlikely something happens to us
24/07/17, 15:29 - Arne: BTW, we had last Saturday even hail
24/07/17, 15:30 - Arne: Damn a mountain, that's cool.
24/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: did it destroy much?
24/07/17, 15:30 - Arne: No they weren't big
24/07/17, 15:30 - Arne: But just weird... It's fucking summer.
24/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: haha, a dutch is awed by mountains 😂
24/07/17, 15:30 - Maureen: could be a hill tho
24/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: I don't know where the border is
24/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: For Dutch standards... Probably a mountain 🤣
24/07/17, 15:31 - Maureen: probably 😂
24/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: 1500m or higher it is called a mountain
24/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: I know this, because I had a presentation 4 years ago about it
24/07/17, 15:31 - Arne: Received a 10
24/07/17, 15:32 - Maureen: 10 is best?
24/07/17, 15:32 - Arne: Yes
24/07/17, 15:34 - Maureen: 6 is worst over here
24/07/17, 15:34 - Maureen: 1 best
24/07/17, 15:35 - Arne: I still don't get it why we have different systems
24/07/17, 15:35 - Maureen: that would be another step into a European state
24/07/17, 15:36 - Arne: Yeah
24/07/17, 17:09 - Amin: Europe
24/07/17, 17:11 - Amin: What do you think about europe?
24/07/17, 17:12 - Arne: Bad history
24/07/17, 17:17 - Maureen: wanna-be-unity
24/07/17, 17:18 - Amin: Hmmm
24/07/17, 17:18 - Amin: Ok if I ask what do you mean by bad history, would you be angry?
24/07/17, 17:19 - Amin: Yes they do, at least economicly
24/07/17, 17:20 - Maureen: we'd expect you to know about two world wars
24/07/17, 17:21 - Maureen: and other cruelties
24/07/17, 17:21 - Maureen: wars
24/07/17, 17:26 - Arne: Yeah. The time we conquer the world
24/07/17, 17:27 - Maureen: and fail
24/07/17, 17:27 - Maureen: at least we did
24/07/17, 17:27 - Maureen: or 1945 germany dud
24/07/17, 17:28 - Arne: That was destroying Europe. And ofc Japan their war
24/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: oh wrong word
24/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: my bad
24/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: still: germany has no area left
24/07/17, 17:29 - Arne: When you lose wars..
24/07/17, 17:34 - Tel: Is that such a bad thing?
24/07/17, 17:34 - Maureen: 1st world war
24/07/17, 17:35 - Maureen: says a brit 😂
24/07/17, 17:36 - Maureen: I don't like the idea of unity. loss of identity and culture
24/07/17, 17:36 - Maureen: we're already losing so much culture due to globalization
24/07/17, 17:37 - Maureen: our language changes so much
24/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: Says a Brit that voted remain ;)
24/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: Hm.. What culture has been lost since 1948?
24/07/17, 17:37 - Tel: I'd say it has been strengthened.. You know, because we're not bombing each other anymore and having to reinvent ourselves ;)
24/07/17, 17:38 - Maureen: I fear that there's a faster progress in language making big ones smaller ones that can easily die out
24/07/17, 17:38 - Tel: Language is blah tho. I'm biased, though, as most speak English I guess
24/07/17, 17:39 - Maureen: we have English ads and commercials. partly without subs. we have more and more anglizisms
24/07/17, 17:40 - Maureen: usual tv is available in english
24/07/17, 17:40 - Maureen: without being connected to the onternet
24/07/17, 17:40 - Maureen: internet
24/07/17, 17:41 - Tel: We increasingly have European TV.. Lots of great stuff from Denmark. Borgen, for instance.. French films, etc. Subtitled, sure, because the English are lazy with languages
24/07/17, 17:41 - Tel: But it's just a language. A communication tool. I don't classify it the same as culture, though I appreciate that it is
24/07/17, 17:41 - Maureen: we dub eberything
24/07/17, 17:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Anglizism is a direct translation
24/07/17, 17:41 - Maureen: language is a main part in identity and culture!
24/07/17, 17:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't know why I found it's autological-ness funny
24/07/17, 17:42 - Maureen: Halloween is included in germany without any historic connection
24/07/17, 17:42 - Tel: Hm, it's not why I go to Germany or Hungary or whatever. It's for the little things - like the pubs or the nurnberger sausages, the history of the place, the ppl
24/07/17, 17:42 - Tel: Language is such a pervasive, yet miniscule, aspect of a culture
24/07/17, 17:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Go to england if you want pubs
24/07/17, 17:43 - Tel: 7%of communication n all that
24/07/17, 17:43 - Maureen: but you can get sausages everywhere
24/07/17, 17:43 - Tel: But I remember the Nuremburg ones ;)
24/07/17, 17:43 - Maureen: you can have pubs everywhere
24/07/17, 17:43 - Maureen: that's the point
24/07/17, 17:43 - Maureen: they are tiny af. try Thüringer
24/07/17, 17:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: <Mídia omitida>
24/07/17, 17:43 - Tel: Hm, I don't get a guy coming around and filling my glass  up at my table like I did in Cologne.
24/07/17, 17:44 - Tel: It's different.. Perhaps it's just my experience, but I don't think so
24/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: again: you can get Kölsch everywhere in germany
24/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: not only in cologne
24/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: 20 years ago you had to go there
24/07/17, 17:45 - Tel: Each place has its own character. Berlin is totally diff to cologne. Both v diff to Nuremburg. Each has their own style and character.. Their own culture.
24/07/17, 17:46 - Tel: Seems we disagree on this point? You know it better maybe, though I'm seeing them each completely fresh
24/07/17, 17:46 - Maureen: but it gets lost due to the fact that you can get their specialties everywhere
24/07/17, 17:46 - Tel: Hm, perhaps. England is interesting as small breweries are massively growing

24/07/17, 17:46 - Maureen: meat that's typical for Kassel
24/07/17, 17:47 - Tel: Germany is much luckier in that it gets different lagers - though no ales anywhere! Kinda sucks. Haha
24/07/17, 17:47 - Maureen: like ginger ale?
24/07/17, 17:47 - Tel: No no, hops n barley

24/07/17, 17:56 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: For one... the only other close country to travel to is Canada, and even that is a couple days of driving. It's always been amazing to me that Europeans can travel to different countries (with different cultures) so easily
24/07/17, 17:57 - Maureen: I can be in France, Switzerland, Austria, Luxemburg and Belgium within 3-4 hours
24/07/17, 17:57 - Maureen: in 5 hours I'm in Czech Republic

24/07/17, 17:58 - Maureen: well, Italy in about 5 hours
24/07/17, 17:59 - Maureen: but when we have to drive for 1+hours we define that as long
24/07/17, 17:59 - Maureen: whereas in Chile where our neighbour town was 30 min away that was nothing
24/07/17, 17:59 - Maureen: we did a 10 hour bus ride to Santiago as a weekend trip

25/07/17, 10:39 - Maureen: have you ever watched Star Trek - Voyager?
25/07/17, 10:41 - Maureen: have you watched a TV series as a kid but you don't remember anything about the stories. and saw an episode as an adult and it's all so familiar. not the stories but the characters and their traits
25/07/17, 11:20 - Tel: Good show.
25/07/17, 11:21 - Tel: Hm. I watched Gremlins as a kid. Scary! Then as an adult.. Funny as heck. 

But that's more about a changing perspective rather than  familiarity
25/07/17, 11:26 - Maureen: I watched voyager with my father when I was little
25/07/17, 11:26 - Maureen: I have no memories beside that I loved seven of nine

25/07/17, 11:30 - Maureen: or more than 15 years
25/07/17, 11:31 - Shaiju: I missed it in my childhood and did not find interesting when I tried watching...
25/07/17, 11:31 - Maureen: seven of nine was my first "celebrity" crush

25/07/17, 12:21 - Shaiju: The question is whether it matters you that it matters to them.

25/07/17, 12:23 - Arne: If you don't know where the problem is... You can't solve it
25/07/17, 12:25 - Shaiju: Well you can always procrastinate... :)
25/07/17, 12:25 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Im living in country that make you should act friendly... always...
So when you're not, everyone thinks you are weird and rude

25/07/17, 12:28 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Well not actually always...

Sometimes its just too awkward for me to be friendly to others. So i was just act as if i dont see them... without saying hello...

Hmmm
25/07/17, 12:29 - Arne: Same problem
25/07/17, 12:29 - Arne: You can just nod at them
25/07/17, 12:29 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I act actually normal and very friendly when im close with someone
25/07/17, 12:29 - Shaiju: Don't try...but live....when you try to be something ,you will never be. It's the genuineness of purpose that makes the effort worthwhile. We can THINK about how others would feel and be accomodatuce...
25/07/17, 12:30 - Shaiju: *acvomodative
25/07/17, 12:30 - Shaiju: *accomodative
25/07/17, 12:30 - Arne: This doesn't require much. At least not for me. And most of the time it is enough. When people say "hello" they want a reaction.
25/07/17, 12:31 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: This brings me to this 'lecturer's gossip'

25/07/17, 12:46 - Arne: Very true. But sometimes other advise needed. He probably thought about this, or was told by others.

25/07/17, 12:48 - Shaiju: It also to be noted that we have to genuinely try to gauge our Fe side... Admiting that we have an under developed Fe and try to improve it a bit might help to cope. We cannot turn a blind eye to the under developed side and hope it to be sidelined.  (Btw who cares what matters.at the end if you don't care it doesn't matter... Repeat)

25/07/17, 12:54 - Shaiju: Oh! It's lot to do with the 'expectations'. Girls are 'expected' to be feelers. Guys can always get away easily with a nonchalant behaviour and that may even attributed to being 'alpha'. Now I understand you.. sorry it's a tough world!
25/07/17, 12:58 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: 🤣
25/07/17, 12:59 - Arne: That is true. But the name Alvi seems to me as for men and woman
25/07/17, 13:00 - Tel: Interesting. I've only known a female Alvi, so I presumed she was a female from the off.
25/07/17, 13:00 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: It's actually a male name here
25/07/17, 13:00 - Tel: Good that we had this situ, otherwise I may have confused a male Alvi for a female..!

25/07/17, 13:20 - Amin: Ok, my believe is that considering my current situation, I study econ, and I want to study Finance in future, so math and programming are seriously urgent for me, I have summer courses for both, and I am doing good, but there are hours that I waste
25/07/17, 13:21 - Amin: Though I have decided not to waste them and study
25/07/17, 13:23 - Amin: The question is, what happens is that although I believe I should study those hours but I dont
25/07/17, 13:24 - Amin: So, I find the situation Im in the reason
25/07/17, 13:24 - Amin: Because all those times Ive talked to my friends

25/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s just how the government will have to respond to unemployment
25/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Tbh at 15, I didn't even really care about what I wanted my career to be
25/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @50494800614
25/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If there s too many jobless people the governement has to take even more money from firms and introduce a basic salary for everyone
25/07/17, 13:40 - Juancho: Be that as it may, i've set a new record (for myself of course).
25/07/17, 13:40 - Juancho: 4 months with the same desired career.
25/07/17, 13:40 - Arne: True. I think the best what you can do at this age, is to know which sides of interest you probably wanna do
25/07/17, 13:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly. I just had to choose between math and bio
25/07/17, 13:42 - Juancho: I've been choosing since I was 4.
25/07/17, 13:42 - Arne: How?
25/07/17, 13:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: When I was 4 I wanted  to become a comedian lul
25/07/17, 13:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well I mean seriously considering what I want as a career
25/07/17, 13:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not like childish fantasies
25/07/17, 13:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: :(
25/07/17, 13:43 - Arne: When I was four. I was just busy with the day itself. Might also for the near future, but nothing more.
25/07/17, 13:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😂😂
25/07/17, 13:43 - Amin: How do u know that?
25/07/17, 13:43 - Juancho: I love to read and ask, whenever I see something that catches my fancy, I become obsessed over it.
25/07/17, 13:43 - Juancho: I read everything there is to know about the topic and then move on to another one.
25/07/17, 13:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: So you dont have a filter for irrelevant stuff?
25/07/17, 13:44 - Amin: Why does i's means?
25/07/17, 13:44 - Amin: Oh
25/07/17, 13:44 - Amin: Ok

25/07/17, 13:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: relevant
25/07/17, 13:45 - Tel: +1
25/07/17, 13:46 - Amin: Why would you comprehend my stress if I were studying computer science rather than finance?!
25/07/17, 13:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah finance doesnt sound easy at all
25/07/17, 13:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: XD
25/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: Juancho age is 15 I guess
25/07/17, 13:47 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Probably you re studying more than me
25/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: Sure
25/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: I study 50 h a week
25/07/17, 13:48 - Juancho: Me neither.

25/07/17, 13:49 - Tel: Yea, class hours at 15 is what.. 25?
25/07/17, 13:49 - Amin: It may be possible, I'll consider that
25/07/17, 13:49 - Tel: Wow. Yea, yea, I'd be lucky if I did 25 hrs private study a month at that age
25/07/17, 13:50 - Tel: Check 'culture iceberg' on Google images and self-analyse
25/07/17, 13:50 - Amin: And what do you mean by knowlege?
25/07/17, 13:50 - Tel: You can adopt it from macro to meta
25/07/17, 13:51 - Tel: By month, I mean term. And by term, I mean year.. And by year, I'm pretty much specifically referring to cramming for exams in the days / weeks immediately preceding it. (by weeks, I am only referring to days..)
25/07/17, 13:52 - Amin: Dude shit is pretty serious for me
25/07/17, 13:52 - Tel: Hm, uni or?

25/07/17, 13:52 - Amin: 6
25/07/17, 13:53 - Tel: Yea, I'd consider it a massive success if I was that disciplined at any point of my life. So defo take it as a compliment
25/07/17, 13:53 - Tel: You're doing what I never could
25/07/17, 13:53 - Tel: (and I've done an MSc..)
25/07/17, 13:53 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I mean knowledge, concepts and ideas and information.... If you re passionate about something and seek that precise information without anyone telling you to do that you learn much faster , at least i can speak for myself
25/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: I guess I wont
25/07/17, 13:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Why study what everyone studies if you can seek the knowledge you re interested in online
25/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: Dude, u know I cant understand that language, tell it again
25/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: Uni
25/07/17, 13:54 - Tel: Up to you. It's interesting stuff

25/07/17, 13:55 - Amin: Thanks tel 🙏
25/07/17, 13:55 - Tel: Lol, it was my being funny. My way of saying I never studied; nvm ;)
25/07/17, 13:55 - Amin: That is a wrong sentence

25/07/17, 13:56 - Amin: Hmmm, I cant neither reject nor accept what u said
25/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont pretend to be good at memorizing
25/07/17, 13:57 - Juancho: As you may have noticed before, I spent a lot of my time bored so i've known how to properly invest it.
25/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: I have my reasons
25/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: Can you send it to me as a private message?
25/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: Aaah 😅😅😅 ok dude
25/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: You are who you are, or are you? 😅
25/07/17, 13:58 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I understand, for me it s to get a career and have a general knowledge of something , but i think i would learn equally as much and enjoy it more if I could actively look for knowledge
25/07/17, 13:59 - Tel: Yup will do - with a friend atm, so later if that's K
25/07/17, 13:59 - Amin: You are saying stuff 🙏🙏
25/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: Yeah, sure, thanks
25/07/17, 14:00 - Tel: Haha!
25/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: Tel
25/07/17, 14:00 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: What do you mean with stuff? did i say something stupid? :D
25/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: What do you mean by stupid?
25/07/17, 14:02 - Amin: Do you like me to share a theory with u?
25/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: in this example , irrelevant , pointless , not intellectually stimulating i dont know
25/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: Hmmm, it was irrelevant to what I said, but it was relevant to what you said
25/07/17, 14:05 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I was actually curious about your reasons , you could have compared yours to mine , which would have made it relevant for you too
25/07/17, 14:06 - Amin: Wait
25/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: Ok, you said there are better ways to acquire knowledge than studing
25/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Ok
25/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: I understand what u mean by knowlege
25/07/17, 14:09 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 14:09 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Independant knowledge, not career focused knowledge
25/07/17, 14:09 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 14:09 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 14:09 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 14:09 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: How do you say better way
25/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: Juancho
25/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: Common
25/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: U are actally spamming kid
25/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: We are talking serious stuff here
25/07/17, 14:10 - Juancho: The picture in the picture says: Religion, giving lobotomies for 15k years
25/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: Whatever
25/07/17, 14:11 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: better because it s less stressful, more time efficient
25/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: Hmmm
25/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: Tom w8
25/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: I' ll be back soon
25/07/17, 14:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Okay
25/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: Back
25/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: Ok
25/07/17, 14:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: So what are your thoughts
25/07/17, 14:13 - Amin: What do you mean by efficient?
25/07/17, 14:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Me for example , I want to become a programmer
25/07/17, 14:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But that doesnt mean I want to know everything that s possible
25/07/17, 14:13 - Amin: Its less stress full, but less stress full is not necessarily better
25/07/17, 14:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Like for example , i could study for another 2 years and have no idea how to program a neural network in java
25/07/17, 14:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: or i could learn it online and know it in a few days
25/07/17, 14:14 - Amin: Before all those words
25/07/17, 14:14 - Amin: Please define efficient
25/07/17, 14:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dug myself a whole
25/07/17, 14:15 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: xD
25/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Um
25/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: 😅😅
25/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But it s true in both ways
25/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Like
25/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: If you want to prepare for a job
25/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: real time practice, and your curiosity and the freedom to explore
25/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: it s possible to adapt really fast without having studied
25/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But it has to be something you enjoy or you will be useless
25/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And if you want to learn to program
25/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: of course you can force yourself to study it at university
25/07/17, 14:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: but if you invest the same time volunarily at home researching and experimentign
25/07/17, 14:18 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: you will get on a whole other level faster
25/07/17, 14:19 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: at university more than 50% of what I learn i will never use and i dont care about it
25/07/17, 14:22 - Juancho: @989306939802 claimed that he had an IQ of 145, you'd think he'd teach himself to program in a few hours.
25/07/17, 14:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 145? that would be nice
25/07/17, 14:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: xD
25/07/17, 14:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: for me
25/07/17, 14:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m a dumb nut unfortunately
25/07/17, 14:23 - Juancho: My dad has an IQ of 145 and he learns shit really fast.
25/07/17, 14:23 - Juancho: My brother 141 and then me, 133😢.
25/07/17, 14:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I can only learn fast when time runs out or if i m eccentric about something
25/07/17, 14:24 - Juancho: Wish mine was higher
25/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Damn
25/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: everywhere geniuses around me
25/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: :D
25/07/17, 14:24 - Juancho: You're in an INTP group. You might as well call us MENSA.
25/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: well i m Intp but i dont have a high IQ
25/07/17, 14:25 - Juancho: I'm gonna go ahead and step on a limb here and say that you could even call us the Triple A Society.
25/07/17, 14:25 - Juancho: Really?
25/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yup
25/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But
25/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: For me
25/07/17, 14:25 - Juancho: Have you ever been tested or just assuming?
25/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I have had some online test where i got 130 and one legit where i got 101 XD
25/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It just means that i m playing life on difficult
25/07/17, 14:26 - Juancho: Online tests are as reliable as waking up and saying that you have x IQ.
25/07/17, 14:27 - Juancho: You probably weren't rested, willing or focused.
25/07/17, 14:27 - Janith: I'm willing to bet Einstein would have sucked in his IQ test top
25/07/17, 14:27 - Janith: *too
25/07/17, 14:27 - Janith: If he ever took one
25/07/17, 14:27 - Juancho: Nooooo.
25/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Or I m normal and can live with it
25/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: :D
25/07/17, 14:27 - Juancho: I personally think he had an IQ of 180+.
25/07/17, 14:28 - Juancho: That kind of intelligence you get once in a century.
25/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah wasnt he autistic?
25/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: The intelligent kind of autism
25/07/17, 14:30 - Janith: I think he wouldn't score much cause he wouldn't see any point in it
25/07/17, 14:31 - Janith: And because he wouldn't be carrying around any of the background knowledge needed to solve questions that weren't purely logical
25/07/17, 14:32 - Amin: Hmmm
25/07/17, 14:35 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: English and german law
25/07/17, 14:35 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: (I m not german)
25/07/17, 14:36 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Math and Logic is okay , it s cool to figure out but I think a lot of it I will forget
25/07/17, 14:37 - Janith: Why tho?
25/07/17, 14:38 - Janith: What are you learning in college?
25/07/17, 14:38 - Janith: I mean your degree
25/07/17, 14:38 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Information Technology (General)
25/07/17, 14:38 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s the first semester
25/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: the coming semesters there will be more relevant classes
25/07/17, 14:39 - Janith: Why German law?
25/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They call it "Online- and Media Law" but in essence , it s just their laws
25/07/17, 14:40 - Janith: Their?
25/07/17, 14:40 - Juancho: I've got a raging case of ADHD, add the typical INTP and high IQ boredom and that's my life.
25/07/17, 14:40 - Juancho: @94754191589, you'd score in the gifted range.
25/07/17, 14:40 - Juancho: I'm certain
25/07/17, 14:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They just make cases like V. sells Printer to B. to make it a little relevant. by their i was referring to germans
25/07/17, 14:40 - Juancho: You're like my brother.
25/07/17, 14:40 - Juancho: Kind of, he's an INTJ
25/07/17, 14:41 - Janith: I only ever took an online test and if I remember correctly I barely qualified for gifted 😂
25/07/17, 14:42 - Janith: Isn't German and English law mostly the same?
25/07/17, 14:42 - Juancho: And our friend @15102464726 here, he has OCD, ADHD, 140+ IQ, imagine learning like that?
25/07/17, 14:42 - Janith: A whole family of INTs???
25/07/17, 14:42 - Juancho: Yep
25/07/17, 14:42 - Juancho: Except my sister.
25/07/17, 14:42 - Juancho: She's the odd one out.
25/07/17, 14:43 - Janith: Duuuuddeee.. That is so epic
25/07/17, 14:43 - Janith: What type is she?
25/07/17, 14:43 - Juancho: No idea.
25/07/17, 14:43 - Juancho: Probably ESFJ
25/07/17, 14:44 - Janith: Oh wow 😂
25/07/17, 14:44 - Juancho: She's as dumb as a rock and is always teasing me.
25/07/17, 14:44 - Janith: Curious, older sister?
25/07/17, 14:44 - Juancho: You know what, scratch that, she annoys me, is what she does.
25/07/17, 14:44 - Juancho: Yeah.
25/07/17, 14:45 - Janith: If your older siblings is an extrovert you have an advantage in social situations with them
25/07/17, 14:45 - Janith: You can just get them into it and fade away
25/07/17, 14:45 - Juancho: How so?
25/07/17, 14:45 - Juancho: Hahahahahaha
25/07/17, 14:45 - Juancho: Use them as a decoy you say?
25/07/17, 14:45 - Janith: Manipulative yes but I was never gonna win any humanitarian awards anyway 😂
25/07/17, 14:45 - Janith: Get them talking.
25/07/17, 14:46 - Juancho: Hahahahahahahahahahwhwywhwhwhwhahwhaha.
25/07/17, 14:46 - Janith: Generally people respond favorably to requests for help when you present it in a personal context
25/07/17, 14:47 - Juancho: That could bolster me in the future.
25/07/17, 14:47 - Janith: With a subtle emphasis on the "value" of their help
25/07/17, 14:47 - Juancho: Make them feel special?
25/07/17, 14:47 - Janith: I had an argument with my mom earlier today on this exact topic. She thinks I shouldn't do it cause it's bad
25/07/17, 14:47 - Janith: Precisely
25/07/17, 14:48 - Janith: Though remember that you're generally just as susceptible to that kind of manipulation
25/07/17, 14:48 - Janith: For the most part people try to be helpful
25/07/17, 14:49 - Janith: It's a good thing in general, but also can be exploited
25/07/17, 14:58 - Juancho: Guys, today i'll be going to an asphalt and cement production factory.
25/07/17, 14:59 - Juancho: So you can expect an overwhelming amount of jibber jabber about it later on in the day.
25/07/17, 15:03 - Janith: I will cement this promise in the foundations of my memory
25/07/17, 15:19 - Juancho: Hahahah.
25/07/17, 15:24 - Juancho: @94754191589, did you see that guy in the physics group?
25/07/17, 15:24 - Juancho: Wow, what a fucking moron.
25/07/17, 15:25 - Janith: Yeah. I'm feeling like trolling someone religious today 😂
25/07/17, 15:25 - Juancho: I have an ever so slightly increasing intolerance for religious people.
25/07/17, 15:27 - Amin: @352621714571  sry, Im gonna pick up were we left off
25/07/17, 15:28 - Amin: Hmmm, so you think they teach you useless stuff at uni, and you think its better for you to learn by your self.
25/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: So You claim that a person with Iq of 145 can learn programming in a few hours, can you support your claim by any reference?!
25/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: As a matter of fact I can.
25/07/17, 15:30 - Juancho: Iq tests memory and speed.
25/07/17, 15:30 - Amin: You dont look smart to me either.
25/07/17, 15:30 - Janith: 🙋‍♂😅
25/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: Which means you can learn a languange (programming) in matter of hours.
25/07/17, 15:31 - Janith: (just had really good source material)
25/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: Well, why don't we ask the fellow INTPs here.
25/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: It also tests problem solving.
25/07/17, 15:32 - Juancho: Programming is problem solving.
25/07/17, 15:32 - Juancho: You see my point.

25/07/17, 15:32 - Juancho: ?

25/07/17, 15:39 - Juancho: Makes it faster and easier.
25/07/17, 15:40 - FABIO: C python assembly
25/07/17, 15:40 - Amin: I don't know about Triple nine, but I know till now, you cant support your claim by any reference

25/07/17, 16:06 - Juancho: @94754191589, coincidentally, he is from Indian descent.
25/07/17, 16:07 - Juancho: @989306939802, bear in mind that I was!'t saying your claimed IQ was true, the mear fact that I was dubious about the claim is because of my need for scrutiny.
25/07/17, 16:07 - Juancho: Wasn't*
25/07/17, 16:08 - Janith: Either there's lots of smart Indians, or there's a lot of Indians so more smart people per square metre
25/07/17, 16:08 - Juancho: Claimed IQ wasn't true*
25/07/17, 16:08 - Juancho: Lot of smart Indians.

25/07/17, 16:09 - Amin: This dude
25/07/17, 16:09 - Juancho: It pisses me off when they say: "higher IQ than Einstein"
25/07/17, 16:10 - Amin: First, awsome memory
25/07/17, 16:10 - Amin: I must say
25/07/17, 16:10 - Juancho: He wasn't even tested, even if he was, he would of scored significantly higher than 160.
25/07/17, 16:10 - Amin: Very impressive
25/07/17, 16:10 - Juancho: Hahaha ik.
25/07/17, 16:10 - Juancho: I envy him.
25/07/17, 16:10 - Amin: And I didn't understand some parts
25/07/17, 16:11 - Juancho: Which one?
25/07/17, 16:11 - FABIO: My pc has... 1tb of it
25/07/17, 16:11 - Amin: Was he arguing about physics?
25/07/17, 16:11 - FABIO: Dont need memory
25/07/17, 16:11 - Amin: Chemistry
25/07/17, 16:11 - FABIO: Need data processing
25/07/17, 16:11 - FABIO: 😂😂😂

25/07/17, 16:12 - Amin: 😅😅
25/07/17, 16:12 - Janith: I barely pay attention to IQ. It's useless. Not an indicator of how valuable a person is
25/07/17, 16:12 - FABIO: Here we are born near retarded.. and need to climb up
25/07/17, 16:12 - Juancho: I myself am getting to memorizing the atomic numbers of the elements just now @989306939802.
25/07/17, 16:12 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂😂
25/07/17, 16:13 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
25/07/17, 16:13 - Amin: Dude, but I stand my claim
25/07/17, 16:13 - Janith: There's plenty of high IQ people who are doing nothing worthwhile for humanity
25/07/17, 16:13 - Juancho: Not the point. Wasn't saying that because you had a high IQ, you were going to succeed.
25/07/17, 16:13 - Amin: Yeah
25/07/17, 16:14 - Juancho: It is very common for high IQ individuals to drop out or under achieve.
25/07/17, 16:14 - Amin: I guess we are in a group that every one is doing what you just said
25/07/17, 16:14 - FABIO: After all. Is iq. Not balls

25/07/17, 16:15 - Janith: I totally agree with this 😂

25/07/17, 16:24 - Amin: Maybe some day we do it together
25/07/17, 16:24 - Janith: Build desalination plants to use any excess energy generated to produce drinking water
25/07/17, 16:25 - Amin: And fabio may help us
25/07/17, 16:25 - Amin: As well
25/07/17, 16:25 - Janith: Maybe create a repository of DNA for the species that are going extinct now because of climate change
25/07/17, 16:25 - Amin: That one I care too, water is very important
25/07/17, 16:25 - FABIO: 😉
25/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: Like it too
25/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: See
25/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: If we had alot of money
25/07/17, 16:26 - Amin: We could do great things
25/07/17, 16:26 - Janith: Finally I'd get a single bedroom apartment and a razer blade and keep a certain amount of money for university
25/07/17, 16:27 - Arne: Yeah very great
25/07/17, 16:27 - Amin: So we need to earn alot of money first
25/07/17, 16:27 - Amin: Endings are diffrent
25/07/17, 16:27 - Janith: Meh. I get to do what I really want to do with or without that kind of money

25/07/17, 16:30 - Janith: Dude, what I want to do involves research mainly. So either government or privately funded
25/07/17, 16:31 - Janith: I'm not saying no money, but I can do what I want without a ton of money
25/07/17, 16:31 - Juancho: We're the same age😀😀.

25/07/17, 16:31 - Juancho: I'd love to talk to this kid.
25/07/17, 16:31 - Juancho: Nice to see he want's to be a physicist
25/07/17, 16:31 - Janith: And I've never found money to be worth the the headache it'll bring at extremely high levels of income
25/07/17, 16:32 - Juancho: He probably is, he was in college at age 10-11.
25/07/17, 16:32 - FABIO: Lame... engineers for the win
25/07/17, 16:32 - FABIO: 😂😂😂

25/07/17, 16:33 - Juancho: All these exceptionally gifted children want to be physicists.
25/07/17, 16:34 - Janith: I'd prefer some good physicists now actually. The current speed limit for space travel is miserably slow
25/07/17, 16:34 - Juancho: Ohh yeah
25/07/17, 16:34 - Juancho: And the fuel is inefficient
25/07/17, 16:34 - Janith: Hopefully with all those neurons being thrown at the problem we can figure out a way to bend the laws of nature
25/07/17, 16:36 - Janith: I don't mind. Means I'll mostly be going up against knuckleheads like me in biology 😂
25/07/17, 16:36 - Juancho: Hahahahaha

25/07/17, 16:38 - Juancho: Or cosmology
25/07/17, 16:38 - Juancho: But certainly physics
25/07/17, 16:39 - Janith: I'll be starting off with a degree in chemistry
25/07/17, 16:39 - Janith: Most probably
25/07/17, 16:40 - FABIO: @50494800614 make a good theory.. I give you a nice working space enginee

25/07/17, 17:17 - Janith: What? I didn't really check it 😅
25/07/17, 17:18 - Janith: @554691068741 did you know the Witcher 3 was made ENTIRELY by hand?.?
25/07/17, 17:18 - Arne: Fz = m•G?

25/07/17, 17:19 - Amin: Its cool
25/07/17, 17:19 - Juancho: Well i'll be dammed. Guess engineering is not as easy as my brother said.
25/07/17, 17:20 - Amin: Juancho

25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: Hahahaha
25/07/17, 17:23 - Arne: You didn't know Fabio? I have never seen, or played that game and I remember that
25/07/17, 17:23 - Janith: Tomorrow. Sleep now
25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: Yes
25/07/17, 17:23 - Arne: Wow
25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: I think
25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: Its about 10ton
25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: Guys
25/07/17, 17:23 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>

25/07/17, 17:25 - Arne: But that laugh tho
25/07/17, 17:25 - Arne: Do you have a higher voice than the regular boy?
25/07/17, 17:25 - Arne: Or is it just your laugh
25/07/17, 17:30 - FABIO: Just laugth
25/07/17, 17:30 - FABIO: Hahahaha
25/07/17, 17:32 - Juancho: Assumption, approximation or fact?
25/07/17, 17:43 - FABIO: Assumption
25/07/17, 17:49 - Juancho: Did you guys see that earthquake proof hospital
25/07/17, 17:49 - Juancho: ?
25/07/17, 18:00 - Juancho: @554691068741, have you noticed that in parking lots 3+ stories tall without a roof or building on top, the structural pillars that run vertically throughout all the floors  run all the way to the last floor, and even in the last floor they stick out?
25/07/17, 18:01 - Juancho: Why is that, is it because it can compromise the structural integrity or for some other reason?
25/07/17, 18:06 - FABIO: Yes.
25/07/17, 18:06 - FABIO: It needs weigth in it
25/07/17, 18:06 - FABIO: To stay strong
25/07/17, 18:07 - FABIO: More big. More momentum.
25/07/17, 18:07 - FABIO: An awesome engineering structure
25/07/17, 18:07 - FABIO: Is the burj khalifa
25/07/17, 18:07 - FABIO: It doesnt have the pendulum inside it
25/07/17, 18:07 - FABIO: All sky tall buoldings
25/07/17, 18:08 - FABIO: Need a mass pendulum inside
25/07/17, 18:08 - FABIO: Other wise.. the wind would crash the building
25/07/17, 18:08 - FABIO: But burj khalifa..doesnt have one
25/07/17, 18:08 - FABIO: Its awesome
25/07/17, 18:08 - FABIO: How they made it
25/07/17, 18:09 - Juancho: How did they make it?
25/07/17, 18:09 - Juancho: It has to withstand 125-150mph wind speed.
25/07/17, 18:09 - FABIO: Exactly
25/07/17, 18:10 - FABIO: It stand it.. only using its shape
25/07/17, 18:10 - Juancho: Tf?
25/07/17, 18:10 - FABIO: They build it... in a way. That cancels the wind effect
25/07/17, 18:12 - Juancho: But it still oscillates right?
25/07/17, 18:20 - FABIO: A little
25/07/17, 18:21 - FABIO: Verry little
25/07/17, 18:21 - FABIO: Its better than if had the pendulum
25/07/17, 20:35 - Juancho: What's the cultural background of the engineers?
25/07/17, 20:36 - Juancho: <Mídia omitida>
25/07/17, 20:36 - Juancho: Trying to find an Atheist community in my country.
25/07/17, 20:37 - Juancho: It's like looking a needle in a haystack.
25/07/17, 20:38 - FABIO: Math
25/07/17, 20:38 - FABIO: They dont know history. Socyology. Pholosophy..
25/07/17, 20:38 - FABIO: Just math
25/07/17, 20:39 - FABIO: They usualy. Arent good1 people. If you are not an engineer too
25/07/17, 20:39 - FABIO: So you can understand them
25/07/17, 20:39 - FABIO: Couse they only talk about engineeribg
25/07/17, 20:57 - Juancho: Catholics think that the higgs boson is a proof of god.
25/07/17, 20:57 - Juancho: 😂😂😂
25/07/17, 20:57 - Juancho: Looking for*
25/07/17, 20:58 - FABIO: 😂😂
25/07/17, 21:02 - Juancho: The way they preach the gospel
25/07/17, 21:02 - Juancho: Annoys me
25/07/17, 21:02 - Juancho: They accept science when it suits them
25/07/17, 21:03 - Juancho: And when it doesn't, they dismiss it as erroneous and god not wanting to reveal himself.
25/07/17, 21:23 - Juancho: They endorse criminals and are nothing but hypocrites.

25/07/17, 23:34 - Juancho: What are the specs for your monitor?
25/07/17, 23:36 - Juancho: @15015198024, you joined at the wring moment, we just finished discussing science and religion.
25/07/17, 23:38 - Infected: Gag me. I want to drill into my brain with a red hot screwdriver every time someone brings up religion/ religion as science / the science of religion, religion (=/=, =) science.
25/07/17, 23:39 - Infected: I'm observing, don't mind my presence.
25/07/17, 23:54 - FABIO: Dont know.. its just a tv1 my brother uses as monitor
25/07/17, 23:55 - FABIO: Mine is the alienware notebook... but this1 game doesnt work there
25/07/17, 23:55 - FABIO: Hahahahaha

26/07/17, 04:19 - Juancho: Just insulted the canadian prime minister on twitter.
26/07/17, 04:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Justin Trudeau? Why?
26/07/17, 04:23 - Juancho: Did you not hear what he did?
26/07/17, 04:23 - Juancho: The fucking bureaucrat payed a terrorist $10M.
26/07/17, 04:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How do I not know about that!
26/07/17, 04:36 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: good guy trudeau
26/07/17, 04:42 - Tel: Hm, elaborate? Technically it does.. Every thought burns calories (very simplistic way of thinking, which I presume isn't your tack..).

I have a feeling I get where you're heading with it, at least partially, though look forward to your elaboration
26/07/17, 04:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Apparently Khadr has alleged inhuman treatment and violation of human rights while he was serving the term of 8 years in the Guantanamo prison
26/07/17, 04:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Which is bound to proceed to court, which incurs legal fees among other expenditure
26/07/17, 04:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There's a viewpoint that if this goes to trial, the payout could be more than the 10M he's given currently
26/07/17, 04:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And Trudeau is a smart man. Hardly a spendthrift. I'm sure he sees things we don't
26/07/17, 04:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I can't see why one would want to insult Trudeau

26/07/17, 06:19 - Lulu: A thousand messages which I will not read
26/07/17, 06:19 - Lulu: Anything substantial that I missed?
26/07/17, 07:11 - Tel: Lots. You'll need to read... :p
26/07/17, 08:15 - Lulu: I mean our definitions of substantial probably differ
26/07/17, 08:16 - Lulu: Either way not trying to read 1023 messages it's kind of a time waster
26/07/17, 08:17 - Lulu: Rip, the theme of religion does not and should not stand as justification for shitty behavior and beliefs still stands tho
26/07/17, 08:24 - Lulu: I guess religion will also kind of be a topic piece
26/07/17, 08:24 - Lulu: I mean as long as someone makes it one
26/07/17, 08:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Someone will always make it one

26/07/17, 13:28 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: His opinion on AI shows me that he can be Ignorant
26/07/17, 13:28 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: He doesnt seem to think things through
26/07/17, 13:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You heard what Elon musk said about him?
26/07/17, 13:29 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: His knowledge is limited

26/07/17, 13:31 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not some geek like Mark
26/07/17, 13:31 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And they think big
26/07/17, 13:31 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Even if it s not always accurate
26/07/17, 13:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly
26/07/17, 13:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They don't limit themselves
26/07/17, 13:33 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Also this is kind of primitive but Mark is a cuck
26/07/17, 13:33 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: While Musk is alpha 😹
26/07/17, 13:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah 😂 badass
26/07/17, 13:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: While on the other hand, though in kinda the same field, Google fares way better

26/07/17, 13:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And look at where it came today from being a search page
26/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: For example
26/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They bought hanson robotics
26/07/17, 13:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Leading team in Ai technology

26/07/17, 13:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And they've been doing it since day one
26/07/17, 13:42 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Imagine Google and Microsoft as one company 🤔
26/07/17, 13:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Do we really need the concurrence?
26/07/17, 13:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Just make it all one company pls
26/07/17, 13:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Get rid of Apple, Samsung, Bing 😂
26/07/17, 13:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That'd be really awesome
26/07/17, 13:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I like apple 😬
26/07/17, 13:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s too expensive for me
26/07/17, 13:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I bought a lenovo lap top which looks like Mac Book 👍🏻
26/07/17, 13:47 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well apple laptops are shit

26/07/17, 13:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I m wondering why Samsung doesnt get it right
26/07/17, 13:50 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Get rid of the shitty preinstalled apps and the apple fanboys will switch
26/07/17, 13:50 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Samsung phones' batteries suck more than anything else
26/07/17, 13:50 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: They last longer
26/07/17, 13:50 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And i can replace them

26/07/17, 13:50 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: My dad uses Samsung and I wouldn't want Samsung at all. Learnt from his experiences
26/07/17, 13:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Well
26/07/17, 13:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: There are pros and cons
26/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: People wouldnt buy it if were that easy
26/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Specs for good money , thats samsung
26/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And easy to replace(on the older models)
26/07/17, 13:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Tbh I did think of getting S8 before I got 7 plus
26/07/17, 13:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But didn't want to take the risk
26/07/17, 13:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Actually I m so unimpressed by new phones in general
26/07/17, 13:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: That unless they implement something big i wont buy a new one
26/07/17, 13:55 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Like battery which you can fully recharge in 10 minuts
26/07/17, 13:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whoa
26/07/17, 13:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't think that's gonna be around for some time
26/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Lithium battery would work i think
26/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Or is that the normal battery
26/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
26/07/17, 13:57 - FABIO: Microsoft. Owns apple
26/07/17, 13:56 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Phones already have lithium ion batteries
26/07/17, 13:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Fuck no. Windows phones suck
26/07/17, 13:58 - FABIO: They are quite good.. just not so many apps
26/07/17, 13:58 - FABIO: Never Saw one freezing

26/07/17, 13:59 - FABIO: ios is a theft
26/07/17, 13:59 - FABIO: I myself will never buy anything from apple
26/07/17, 13:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 5C did freeze sometimes
26/07/17, 14:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: As long as it's phones, I'm 95% sure I'd go for apple
26/07/17, 14:00 - FABIO: Starting that i dont mim e jobs
26/07/17, 14:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: ?

26/07/17, 14:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I want to as well. iPhones cost an unnecessary lot
26/07/17, 14:02 - FABIO: In engineering classes
26/07/17, 14:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But somehow end up getting apple again
26/07/17, 14:02 - FABIO: You hardly saw any apple product
26/07/17, 14:02 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: True
26/07/17, 14:02 - FABIO: Everyone dislikes
26/07/17, 14:02 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Depends on the college/uni though
26/07/17, 14:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly
26/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Most of them might not have the required money lying around
26/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: In Usa in rich white people unis i guess many will use apple 😂
26/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Just a guess
26/07/17, 14:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've even see most journalists and people in a similar field using apple for productivity
26/07/17, 14:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But don't quite understand what they do on mac which can't be done on windows
26/07/17, 14:05 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Maybe a few editors
26/07/17, 14:05 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But for the rest i dont know
26/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I recommend Lenovo Yoga 710
26/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah I heard it's good
26/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s just not for gaming
26/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There's this girl I know who has it. And I used it for a day with her. Was great
26/07/17, 14:07 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Does she have the silver one too?
26/07/17, 14:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Probably
26/07/17, 14:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't exactly remember
26/07/17, 14:07 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You can also use it as a tablet
26/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And it looks like a mac book 😎
26/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep
26/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That I didn't notice
26/07/17, 14:08 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s close
26/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah
26/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Gotta catch you later. Have a good day

26/07/17, 14:31 - Infected: *Most* people in America don't bother learning pro's & con's of products. They want whatever is newest and most expensive, ime, anyway.
26/07/17, 14:32 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s not bad.... for the economy
26/07/17, 14:32 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Cant blame them
26/07/17, 14:35 - Infected: It doesn't make sense to me.
26/07/17, 14:37 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont know, I dont think it s that bad over there
26/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: There are a lot of young people in europe who dont care
26/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Mostly girls
26/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s what I observed
26/07/17, 14:39 - Infected: It is and it isn't. It's a great country, nice trees and pretty skies. I'm not fond of the loudness of it.
26/07/17, 14:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But hey
26/07/17, 14:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: You have trump
26/07/17, 14:40 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: IT S SOMETHING
26/07/17, 14:42 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
26/07/17, 14:42 - Infected: Trump is a rich, white, old dude. He has a lot of confidence in himself so the people that follow him have confidence in him.
26/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: To me he s just a funny troll
26/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I actually like him, and it doesnt seem to me like he did too much damage
26/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😹
26/07/17, 14:43 - Arne: Lol serious?
26/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Well
26/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont take him seriously
26/07/17, 14:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But come on
26/07/17, 14:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s funny to watch him
26/07/17, 14:44 - Arne: Are you trying to defend him just for the reason he is funny?
26/07/17, 14:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yes
26/07/17, 14:44 - Arne: Lol
26/07/17, 14:44 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I mean yeah climate change
26/07/17, 14:45 - Infected: He said the right things at the right time and a lot of unhappy people who got fucked on their insurance and laid off from their jobs that went overseas voted for him. I think he's a great orator, I'll give him that. Not the most eloquent guy but engaging.
26/07/17, 14:45 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: But you know what they say, first it has to become ugly to become beautiful
26/07/17, 14:45 - Arne: Never heard of
26/07/17, 14:45 - Arne: Do you support his ideas also?
26/07/17, 14:46 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: No he just explains the phenomenon that he is
26/07/17, 14:46 - Infected: I don't support him or not support him. He'll do whatever he does and then someone else will take his place and do whatever they do.
26/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: No
26/07/17, 14:47 - Arne: Hmm okay
26/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: Dont know on eua
26/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: But in brazil
26/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: If you are an engineer. And using apple
26/07/17, 14:47 - FABIO: You lost a lot of credit
26/07/17, 14:48 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It always depends
26/07/17, 14:48 - Infected: There has never been a president that people didn't hate or complain about. To some people he's like the messiah, to others he's a demon to he purged. He's just a man that's motivated by simple things, imo. People like to get riled up because it gives them purpose.
26/07/17, 14:48 - FABIO: Its engineering.. not sociology or anything
26/07/17, 14:49 - FABIO: Here it 1 or 0
26/07/17, 14:49 - FABIO: 😂😂
26/07/17, 14:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Haha
26/07/17, 14:49 - FABIO: You dont have a good reason. To use apple
26/07/17, 14:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: && :^)
26/07/17, 14:49 - FABIO: Android does the same.. with less cost
26/07/17, 14:49 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: || :^)
26/07/17, 14:50 - Arne: Indeed, you can look about it that way. Here the people I know about liked Obama. And don't like trump
26/07/17, 14:50 - FABIO: And windows or apple... the answer is linux
26/07/17, 14:50 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂
26/07/17, 14:50 - Arne: Search for the phone Oneplus 5
26/07/17, 14:50 - Juancho: How come?
26/07/17, 14:50 - Infected: I don't like itunes, tbh. I use Samsung because it's affordable and has more content that I can relate to.
26/07/17, 14:51 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Jeb Bush memes
26/07/17, 14:51 - FABIO: You can root... you dont have1 to pay for everything.. and the spare parts are cheapper
26/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: Really.. no fucking reason to have apple.. unless you are a fucking hipster
26/07/17, 14:52 - FABIO: 😂😂😂
26/07/17, 14:53 - Infected: A lot of my friends wanted Clinton to win. I just didn't trust her. I  didn't trust trump either but the libertarian candidate couldn't be taken seriously en masse.
26/07/17, 14:53 - Arne: I was grown up with an iPod, three years ago I received an iPad which I need for school. 
Now I still have those. But only use my iPad and my Oneplus 3 phone
26/07/17, 14:53 - Arne: It must have been hard for Clinton to know she had in total more votes than Trump had
26/07/17, 14:54 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I d like to see modern oligarchy in the US, i dont think one person should be president
26/07/17, 14:54 - Infected: If the hype is to be believed, she went into hysterics.
26/07/17, 14:55 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: There should be young people, old and wise people,  experts in economy and technology working out solutions
26/07/17, 14:55 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😂
26/07/17, 14:56 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: One person will always be too ignorant in many ways to lead a country
26/07/17, 14:56 - Infected: I don't think there is any one person that is fit to be a president, anywhere.  I like the idea of a ruling council but not congress.
26/07/17, 14:57 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 👍
26/07/17, 14:58 - Arne: One leader is the most affective, only that person have to be convinced about something. Otherwise it would take a very long time to pass those laws and stuff. Not saying that one leader is a good thing, just the most affective.
26/07/17, 15:01 - Infected: I agree with you in a way. A single leader has more accountability to make decisions. It's also more simple to blame the individual for ideas/actions you don't agree with.
26/07/17, 15:03 - Infected: It seems that simple but it's really not. The president has a cabinet of advisors and his own interests at play. You don't know what his interests are until after they take office. You go by who you believe more at the time. It's not efficient imo
26/07/17, 15:31 - Juancho: Any other methylphenidate users in here?
26/07/17, 18:49 - Tel: You're right. You're both right. The system is fucked up. 

Every system is perfectly designed to produce the results that it gets - Deming
26/07/17, 18:50 - Tel: The question isn't about which president is better, it's how do we effect a change in the system to effect a better president
26/07/17, 18:51 - Infected: That's what I was thinking about.
26/07/17, 18:51 - Tel: Any president would be better if, for instance, every back room chat had to be recorded and released after 70 years (random idea I just produced to prove a point)
26/07/17, 18:52 - Infected: Don't they already do something similar to that?
26/07/17, 18:52 - Tel: Our something about media ties / coverage - limitations on what news outlets could publish, or limits on their bias that were enforceable in a civil court
26/07/17, 18:52 - Tel: Again - just making it up..
26/07/17, 18:52 - Tel: Backroom chats aren't recorded
26/07/17, 18:53 - Tel: It can't technically be done really.. You'd have to follow them into toilets and blah blah..
26/07/17, 18:54 - Infected: I have to look something up.
26/07/17, 18:54 - Tel: Idano what the right actions to take are, but the ppl aren't to blame. Trump won in the system that was provided to him. So did Hitler. So did Obama, Mandela, and every other elected leader
26/07/17, 18:55 - Tel: The system is the thing that needs tweaking though
26/07/17, 18:55 - Tel: Cool. I'm Gna try catch some z's
26/07/17, 18:55 - Tel: Hit me up if you wanna continue this! Interesting topic

26/07/17, 18:56 - Infected: Alright. (Haven't seen that show)
26/07/17, 18:59 - Tel: It's pretty good actually. I only stayed watching recently and caught up with the latest episode tonight.. I like. Would recommend
26/07/17, 18:59 - Tel: Apparently it's got viewing numbers almost matching Game of Thrones
26/07/17, 19:00 - Infected: I'll give it a look. I've been watching Mr. Robot and Strain.
26/07/17, 19:01 - Tel: Mr Robot is good. Only seen S1. Think 2nd is out
26/07/17, 19:01 - Tel: Strain is easy watching. Good fun :)
26/07/17, 19:02 - Infected: I like interesting characters. Schizophrenics and vampires are good fun.

26/07/17, 20:33 - Juancho: Great show.
26/07/17, 20:34 - Juancho: Can any neurobiologist here tell me what the brain chemistry of an autistic person is and how it relates to asynchronous development?

27/07/17, 01:56 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: If i have interest it would be fast
27/07/17, 01:58 - Arne: And don't forget that it also have to do with your own ability of learning
27/07/17, 02:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Generally, a fast learner but depends on the IQ as well
27/07/17, 02:01 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: How many points needed to be a fast learner?
27/07/17, 02:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well I'm not sure

27/07/17, 03:44 - Didier: But it works the same for me
27/07/17, 03:44 - Didier: I think it's the same for both infps and intps from what I noticed
27/07/17, 03:59 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: What is infp main functions?
27/07/17, 04:01 - Janith: Generally you're gonna be good at something you are interested in
27/07/17, 04:02 - Janith: Interest makes it easier to filter out distractions so people learn faster
27/07/17, 04:04 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Lets change the question
If INTP try to learn something out of his interest, is he considered faster than most mbti types?
27/07/17, 04:05 - Janith: That depends on the intelligence of the person in question
27/07/17, 04:06 - Janith: Though wait
27/07/17, 04:06 - Janith: If it's out of their interest then there's a chance he'll be one of the slowest
27/07/17, 04:06 - Janith: At least... That's my experience
27/07/17, 04:12 - Tel: Primary = introverted feeling
Auxiliary = extroverted intuition
Tertiary = introverted sensing
Inferior = extroverted thinking
27/07/17, 04:12 - Tel: If you're talking cognitive functions anyway. Presumably so in an mbti group
27/07/17, 04:13 - Tel: The T and F are exact opposite in terms of primary / inferior and introverted and extroverted, but N and S are exactly the same
27/07/17, 04:13 - Tel: To INTPs that is
27/07/17, 06:19 - Arne: Sometimes, example learning France words for tests, and I don't have the feeling that I should hurry, I have to be active thinking about that I have to learn them. Only then I can get the words pretty fast in my head. Otherwise it is more difficult
27/07/17, 07:01 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I hate that language 😪
27/07/17, 07:08 - Arne: Only on that school subject I stood insufficient
27/07/17, 09:26 - ‪+62 821-9721-6187‬ entrou usando o link de convite deste grupo
27/07/17, 09:26 - Didier: Yup INTPs have introverted thinking and extroverted feeling instead
27/07/17, 09:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: My friend ate a few weed brownies at school today...
27/07/17, 09:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: 'Five or six maybe, I got confused around number 3'
27/07/17, 09:49 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Should I worry?
27/07/17, 10:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not at all
27/07/17, 10:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Weed is the most potent when smoked. And tbh 3 brownies won't get you even 10% high
27/07/17, 10:18 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Thanks
27/07/17, 10:44 - ‪+62 821-9721-6187‬: Guys, is it common for INTP females- for not having such emotion swings when they're on period? '-' because i don't have one.
27/07/17, 10:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: My INTP ex used to be irritable sometimes, but mostly like she normally was
27/07/17, 10:54 - ‪+62 852-6922-2089‬: me either.. 🖖
27/07/17, 10:55 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: Same
27/07/17, 11:07 - ‪+62 821-9721-6187‬: Is it due to our inferior Fe? Because my friends keeps wondering why do i feel so calm and relaxed. 😂 @919426153395 @6285269222089 @85267387194
27/07/17, 11:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haha no idea. Haven't had the experience in the first place 😂
27/07/17, 11:11 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Guys what happened when you're in love with an E?
27/07/17, 11:12 - Imeldaroswara: You feel it...but most of INTP can suppress it..
27/07/17, 11:13 - Imeldaroswara: Oftentimes, I feel like I want to bite someone's head.... Especially when they're doing something stupid....but they will never know.
27/07/17, 11:13 - ‪+852 6738 7194‬: I feel something wrong but just keep calm and don't give a fuck
27/07/17, 11:28 - Tel: Yup! Sorry if that wasn't clear from what I said
27/07/17, 11:50 - ‪+62 852-6922-2089‬: maybe because Fi is our very last function (8th), so we, kind of, disconnect with our own feeling.. just my thought.. 

but for me, don't feel an emotion swings is a good thing, so I don't mind to don't have one..
27/07/17, 12:22 - Tel: Hm, what research is there that evidences the order of all 8 functions? I haven't seen this yet
27/07/17, 12:22 - Tel: I mean, it makes sense at least
27/07/17, 12:28 - Lulu: Pretty sure that just depends on the person, I don't get any specific cravings or anything like that on my period although others do. It could also change if you are young because I use to have no symptoms whatsoever but recently I have started developing menstrual migraines
27/07/17, 12:28 - Lulu: Although I do not get mood swings really
27/07/17, 12:29 - Lulu: A lot of other type girls can be emotional regardless of being on their period or not so since we are less emotional in general it probably makes us less inclined to become moreso
27/07/17, 12:42 - Infected: I get extremely irritable on my period. I don't notice it as a conscious effort, it's more like a byproduct in my head that gets ignored. Although, I do tend to be more of a shrew during that time.
27/07/17, 13:05 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I get extremely irritable from being too long with people
27/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: I dont
27/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: No
27/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: Let me correct
27/07/17, 13:06 - Amin: What do you mean by too long?
27/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: If its 10 h a week
27/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: Im cool
27/07/17, 13:07 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: +5 hours/day

27/07/17, 13:07 - Amin: I dont mind classes
27/07/17, 13:08 - Amin: But my classes are 10 people a class
27/07/17, 13:08 - Amin: And they are university classes
27/07/17, 13:08 - Amin: And I may ask
27/07/17, 13:08 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I dont know why but merely the presence of other people makes me so tired mentally
27/07/17, 13:08 - Amin: What irritates you?
27/07/17, 13:09 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I guess I cant act natural around people
27/07/17, 13:09 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: When I m alone I can just close my eyes, listen to noone and chill
27/07/17, 13:10 - Amin: Introverts actors, told by johny dep, I guess
27/07/17, 13:10 - Amin: Said*
27/07/17, 13:10 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Yeah I m definetely more the introvert type of person
27/07/17, 13:11 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I like being with people,but not too long
27/07/17, 13:11 - Amin: I like to drink with my friends

27/07/17, 13:12 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: And i m fine with alcohol and shisha
27/07/17, 13:12 - Amin: What do you mean by shisha? Hash?
27/07/17, 13:13 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Um

27/07/17, 13:14 - Amin: But alcohol and weed I like more
27/07/17, 13:14 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: In germany too thanks to the turks

27/07/17, 13:17 - Amin: I want super models
27/07/17, 13:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: A guy explained why some guys do excessive girls,and one major reason was better girls
27/07/17, 13:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Ehm
27/07/17, 13:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: My brain is damaged
27/07/17, 13:17 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Excessive work*
27/07/17, 13:17 - Amin: Rational
27/07/17, 13:17 - Amin: Better girls need harder work
27/07/17, 13:18 - Amin: U havent asked me
27/07/17, 13:18 - Arne: What do you "better girls" mean?
27/07/17, 13:18 - Amin: Why do I want better girls?

27/07/17, 13:19 - Arne: That's impossuble
27/07/17, 13:19 - Amin: Thats why I want more and you dont

27/07/17, 13:21 - Amin: You should ask what want means?
27/07/17, 13:21 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is Arne m/f?

27/07/17, 13:22 - Arne: I wanted to ask that. But then I thought that it has a hidden meaning for me, as I ain't as good in english
27/07/17, 13:23 - Arne: Nothing to do with it. Amin has pink
27/07/17, 13:23 - Amin: How are you doing my fb friend?
27/07/17, 13:23 - Arne: But answer your own question
27/07/17, 13:23 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I know but my brain is out of energy, critical thinking is disabled right now
27/07/17, 13:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm doing great, man. How you doin
27/07/17, 13:25 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is anyone else considering to buy a Tesla Model 3 in the future?
27/07/17, 13:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm considering a tesla. No specificity yet
27/07/17, 13:26 - Janith: What we talking about?
27/07/17, 13:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Hot girls
27/07/17, 13:26 - Amin: Want is result of seeing s.that creat good feeling in you
27/07/17, 13:26 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s the cheapest one, 35.000 $
27/07/17, 13:26 - Amin: Good
27/07/17, 13:27 - Amin: I dont how having tesla 3 feels
27/07/17, 13:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: It s super fast and quiet
27/07/17, 13:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Thats it
27/07/17, 13:27 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: 😄
27/07/17, 13:27 - Amin: Most important thing in my life at the current timw
27/07/17, 13:27 - Amin: I dont know how super fast and quiet feels
27/07/17, 13:27 - Arne: Oh I thought you meant a different want from a different sentence you said after the want sentence you mean.
27/07/17, 13:28 - Amin: Janith
27/07/17, 13:28 - Amin: Why do you want what you want?
27/07/17, 13:29 - Arne: Why do you want to know that Amin...
27/07/17, 13:29 - Arne: I thought you already know what men wants
27/07/17, 13:29 - Amin: I want to compare others reasons to mine
27/07/17, 13:30 - Amin: I dont
27/07/17, 13:30 - Arne: And everyone knows what want means
27/07/17, 13:30 - Arne: So why holding it as a secret 🤣
27/07/17, 13:31 - Amin: Are you talking about pussy?
27/07/17, 13:31 - Amin: 😅
27/07/17, 13:32 - Amin: You talked  kind of vague  in my view
27/07/17, 13:32 - Janith: Curiousity
27/07/17, 13:32 - Janith: Interest
27/07/17, 13:33 - Amin: Hmm
27/07/17, 13:33 - Amin: I want what I want because it feels good
27/07/17, 13:33 - Arne: Something else, but it has to with it. You say it like there are no bi people here etc.
27/07/17, 13:33 - Amin: Does curiosity feel good?
27/07/17, 13:34 - Amin: Feels most good I most correct
27/07/17, 13:35 - Janith: Only reason to live for me
27/07/17, 13:35 - Infected: This is a very subjective conversation.
27/07/17, 13:35 - Amin: Aaaah, I got it now, Im kinda bi too, sexual stuff feels good, very good, very very very very good
27/07/17, 13:35 - Amin: Uh, so it must feel more than good
27/07/17, 13:36 - Amin: It is, wanting is subjective by nature
27/07/17, 13:37 - Amin: I wish your family name is mushroom
27/07/17, 13:37 - Amin: So I can call you infected mushroom
27/07/17, 13:37 - Amin: 😅😅😅
27/07/17, 13:38 - Infected: Indeed. Individual motivations are sometimes aggravating to me.
27/07/17, 13:38 - Janith: Not necessarily. It's a desire to learn and to know but it doesn't feel good like most other things
27/07/17, 13:38 - Infected: Call me that, if you wish. I don't have a preference.
27/07/17, 13:39 - Amin: What makes you feel good?
27/07/17, 13:40 - Amin: Do you have one?
27/07/17, 13:40 - Janith: Reading, learning etc
27/07/17, 13:41 - Amin: Hmmm, I like the way u are
27/07/17, 13:42 - Amin: Good vine
27/07/17, 13:42 - Amin: Vibe*
27/07/17, 13:42 - Janith: Me too. It makes life easier for me.
27/07/17, 13:43 - Infected: I'm motivated by various things. Mostly, my severe introversion and my desire to be alone. I have an offspring which puts my internal processes out of harmony at times. I have to do things I don't want to do for the benefit of another person. At the same time, I feel satisfied to have made this other person happy and to have taken care of their needs.
27/07/17, 13:43 - Amin: What does that mean?
27/07/17, 13:44 - Janith: The less you care about the easier things get
27/07/17, 13:46 - Arne: It was accidentally
27/07/17, 13:46 - Amin: Dont you care about reading?
27/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: 😘
27/07/17, 13:47 - Arne: Reading is my most favorite hobby
27/07/17, 13:47 - Amin: Looking at nude body of a girl and her skin is mine
27/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: And her body curves
27/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: And her body color
27/07/17, 13:48 - Amin: And other stuffs about girls
27/07/17, 13:49 - Janith: Not particularly
27/07/17, 13:50 - Janith: I enjoy it so I do it. I could probably live without it as long as I had some other way to acquire information
27/07/17, 13:51 - Janith: If I can't keep learning my mental state starts to deteriorate
27/07/17, 13:51 - Amin: Hmmm, but you enjoy games right?
27/07/17, 13:52 - Janith: I enjoy a good story. So yeah I guess you could say that
27/07/17, 13:53 - Amin: Uuuh, you need learning then, right?
27/07/17, 13:53 - Janith: No other medium provides that experience
27/07/17, 13:53 - Infected: I don't understand the appeal of being overly preoccupied with sexual desires/activities. I'm aware that it's a normal part of forming certain types of relationships but I don't particularly enjoy romantic involvement.
27/07/17, 13:53 - Janith: Yes. Without that I'd have killed myself long ago
27/07/17, 13:53 - Janith: Me neither. I find it nearly pointless
27/07/17, 13:54 - Amin: I know, I know, you need learning by very definition of need
27/07/17, 13:55 - Janith: Yeah
27/07/17, 13:55 - Amin: I dont enjoy romance either, I like the physical part
27/07/17, 13:56 - Infected: I've procreated which is the point of physical intimacy so I don't see a further need/ use for it.
27/07/17, 13:56 - Amin: Its not for me
27/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: I told you
27/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: I say again
27/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: Very precise
27/07/17, 13:57 - Amin: The way the physical shape of girls are, and the way they customize them selves, makes me feel good
27/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: And many things about them
27/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: And not any girl
27/07/17, 13:58 - Amin: Only high quality girls
27/07/17, 13:58 - Janith: I guess I can appreciate those things too. But I don't really find them attractive 😂
27/07/17, 13:59 - Amin: Even high quality ones? 😅
27/07/17, 14:00 - Amin: In high quality pools
27/07/17, 14:00 - Infected: It's normal for the human species to have preferences for sexual partners. Some of it is instinctual to further the population.
27/07/17, 14:00 - Janith: Depends. If they're intelligent I'm attracted. If not they're Meh
27/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: Yeah intelligent high quality ones with a high quality life😅
27/07/17, 14:01 - Amin: High quality life is about you
27/07/17, 14:01 - Infected: Men liking wide hips and large breasted women, for example. Wider hips make it easier to birth babies and larger breasts denote the ability to suckle offspring.
27/07/17, 14:01 - Janith: I don't really care about the other two. The first is the only thing I've ever noticed 😂
27/07/17, 14:02 - Amin: Do you like 3 very intelligent girls discussing about sicience? 😅
27/07/17, 14:02 - Arne: Ted talks, and that kind of talks
27/07/17, 14:02 - Amin: And you are their master
27/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: And they ask you whenever they dont know some thing
27/07/17, 14:03 - Janith: I meant in terms of interactivity, progression and content. Nothing else matches the level of video games
27/07/17, 14:03 - Janith: Yeah I guess
27/07/17, 14:03 - Amin: Amen
27/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: You can if you are rich
27/07/17, 14:04 - Amin: And have a house
27/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: And interesting things to allure them
27/07/17, 14:05 - Amin: Thats why money is very important
27/07/17, 14:05 - Janith: Like an interesting paper I just published?
27/07/17, 14:06 - Janith: If they came cause of money they can show themselves put
27/07/17, 14:06 - Janith: *out
27/07/17, 14:06 - Infected: You only accrue money to lure females?
27/07/17, 14:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How easy would it be to influence someone if you knew exactly what it takes to do that
27/07/17, 14:06 - Amin: Maybe, sure
27/07/17, 14:07 - Amin: There are more reasons, but girls are in top, mostly yes
27/07/17, 14:08 - Infected: That's unexpected, tbh.
27/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: What's unexpected?
27/07/17, 14:08 - Amin: Yeah, your girls, your rules, mine come with money
27/07/17, 14:09 - Infected: For sex to be that much of a motivation to someone is unexpected to me.
27/07/17, 14:09 - Amin: Its not for sex
27/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: Dude you dont pay attention
27/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: It may result to sex, some times
27/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: But mostly having the ability to play with them
27/07/17, 14:10 - Amin: And the feeling they create
27/07/17, 14:11 - Infected: I'm paying attention, the information just doesn't make sense to me.
27/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: And its for right now
27/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: After that
27/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: I go for the next thing that feels good
27/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: The most
27/07/17, 14:11 - Amin: Ok
27/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: It doesn't have to
27/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: But if you want wide range of high quality females
27/07/17, 14:12 - Amin: A lot of money is what you need
27/07/17, 14:13 - Janith: @15015198024, Amin is talking about playing with the reward system related to procreation. He's basically trying to go from dopamine hit to dopamine hit
27/07/17, 14:14 - Amin: Man🙏
27/07/17, 14:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't agree with that. I have some great females, not my gfs, who are there with me but I don't think money is a factor at all
27/07/17, 14:14 - Amin: Janith, have you tried Ritalin?
27/07/17, 14:14 - Janith: No. What's that?
27/07/17, 14:14 - Janith: I use setraline
27/07/17, 14:15 - Amin: Google it, read about it,
27/07/17, 14:15 - Amin: But it feels very good
27/07/17, 14:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's a different thing you couldn't pick up strangers without showing money, cus that's all they want
27/07/17, 14:15 - Amin: Oh God
27/07/17, 14:15 - Amin: It gives you self confidence
27/07/17, 14:15 - Amin: Feeling of power
27/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: And makes you super focused for studing
27/07/17, 14:16 - Infected: So, it isn't just the act of sex that you're after but the physical act of being with a woman you deem of high quality?
27/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: Do you own them?
27/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Of course I don't own them
27/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: 😅
27/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Are you talking about human trafficking?
27/07/17, 14:16 - Janith: Treatment for ADHD
27/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: You are young jash
27/07/17, 14:17 - Amin: Treatment for intp 😂
27/07/17, 14:17 - Janith: Precisely
27/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Like what you mean you wanna buy women?
27/07/17, 14:17 - Amin: Exactly
27/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That I can't deny 😅
27/07/17, 14:17 - Amin: You know me well😂
27/07/17, 14:17 - Infected: I don't understand the value of being in the presence of someone that you're only attracted to in a physical / dominating sense.
27/07/17, 14:18 - Amin: Age changes some people
27/07/17, 14:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It changes everyone
27/07/17, 14:18 - Amin: And owning them of course
27/07/17, 14:18 - Janith: @989306939802 is generally the kind of egomaniac rich guy you think you'd only read about or watch in movies. 

Mean no disrespect Amin. Just the most accurate way of describing you I understand
27/07/17, 14:19 - Amin: It feels good, I only do things that feels good
27/07/17, 14:19 - Amin: 😅😅
27/07/17, 14:19 - Infected: The closest irl example I can correlate that to is Donald Trump.
27/07/17, 14:19 - Amin: He is too angry for my taste
27/07/17, 14:20 - Janith: Well.... Yes but of higher intelligence
27/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: Simple code
27/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: Do what feels good
27/07/17, 14:20 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Bullseye
27/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: And the thing that feels good and you cant have
27/07/17, 14:20 - Amin: Try for them
27/07/17, 14:20 - Infected: I understand the information now. I just don't personally see the appeal of such actions.
27/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: People are diffrent
27/07/17, 14:21 - Janith: Psychopathic traits
27/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: And feelings are diffrent
27/07/17, 14:21 - Janith: Probably moral conditioning too
27/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: 😅😅😅
27/07/17, 14:21 - Janith: Amin is religious
27/07/17, 14:21 - Amin: 😅😅😅
27/07/17, 14:22 - Amin: Too much info janith, he cant take it
27/07/17, 14:22 - Infected: Socioeconomic conditioning, perhaps.
27/07/17, 14:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: She, I think
27/07/17, 14:22 - Janith: Sorry Amin. Don't take it the wrong way. I like you but I like being honest even more
27/07/17, 14:22 - Amin: I believe there is no reason to act the way you believe
27/07/17, 14:23 - Amin: Seriously?
27/07/17, 14:23 - Janith: Did you just assume their gender??? 😂
27/07/17, 14:23 - Amin: Nice to meet you darling
27/07/17, 14:23 - Infected: I'm a female, if you're referring to me.
27/07/17, 14:23 - Janith: Amin don't you dare start disrespecting her just cause she's a girl
27/07/17, 14:23 - Amin: Honey, Im sorry for harsh stuff
27/07/17, 14:23 - Infected: What harsh stuff?
27/07/17, 14:23 - Amin: Dude, I wont, if she plays nice
27/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: Nothing, I respect you
27/07/17, 14:25 - Infected: From what I've processed through our conversation, I highly doubt that you have any sort of personal respect for me but at the same time, I don't care. I did not find the conversation unpleasant.
27/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: No janith told me to respect you, and I respected you 😅😅😅
27/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: He is an admin
27/07/17, 14:26 - Janith: 😂😂😂😂
27/07/17, 14:26 - Arne: Forced respect isn't respect
27/07/17, 14:26 - Janith: Sorry @15015198024. Still training him
27/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: What is respect?
27/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: You think you are
27/07/17, 14:27 - Infected: I'm not understanding. I do not feel disrespected.
27/07/17, 14:28 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
27/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: Its because you have such a beautiful soul
27/07/17, 14:28 - Arne: I gotta go guys
27/07/17, 14:28 - Arne: Bye
27/07/17, 14:28 - Janith: He's been playing nice so far. He tried messing with me when he thought I was a girl 😂
27/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: Bye arne
27/07/17, 14:28 - Janith: See you later Arne
27/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
27/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: Yeah I remember
27/07/17, 14:29 - Janith: Though tbh Amin is probably one of the nicer assholes you'll meet
27/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: What does asshole mean?
27/07/17, 14:31 - Amin: Janith if you say the defenition
27/07/17, 14:31 - Amin: Right now it fits you more than me
27/07/17, 14:31 - Janith: That's why I said you're one of the nicer assholes 😂
27/07/17, 14:32 - Janith: I'm one of the meaner ones
27/07/17, 14:32 - Amin: Eeeh
27/07/17, 14:32 - Amin: U have psychological issues
27/07/17, 14:32 - Amin: I know
27/07/17, 14:32 - Amin: 😂😂😂
27/07/17, 14:33 - Amin: Mushroom, we are not very psychologically healthy people
27/07/17, 14:33 - Janith: Oh that's not the cause. Just a terrible person 😊
27/07/17, 14:33 - Amin: No you are kind, dont say that love 😘
27/07/17, 14:34 - Infected: I asked for a further explanation of the information he had posted. I'm not good with immediate understanding of concepts having to do with interpersonal relationships/ appeal. He gave me the information I requested in a thorough explanation without use of sarcasm or expletives.
27/07/17, 14:34 - Janith: I'm also not bi
27/07/17, 14:34 - Amin: Even for me? 😕
27/07/17, 14:34 - Janith: Especially for you 😉
27/07/17, 14:35 - Amin: I love the way you talk
27/07/17, 14:35 - Amin: You sound like a girl that hate me 😂😂😂
27/07/17, 14:35 - Janith: Me too.
27/07/17, 14:35 - Amin: Mostly girls treat me like that, but after all, they love me in their heart
27/07/17, 14:36 - Amin: I said firs
27/07/17, 14:36 - Amin: Dibs on mushroom
27/07/17, 14:36 - Amin: Aaah

27/07/17, 14:36 - Amin: 😂😂
27/07/17, 14:36 - Infected: I'm not a high quality female.
27/07/17, 14:36 - Janith: Nice to meet you @15015198024. Glad to meet someone else who's in touch with their robotic side 😊
27/07/17, 14:37 - Amin: I can disregard that this time
27/07/17, 14:37 - Janith: No relationships for me right now.
27/07/17, 14:37 - Amin: Loooooooser
27/07/17, 14:37 - Amin: 😅
27/07/17, 14:37 - Infected: I'm more in touch with my Data side than my Lore side.
27/07/17, 14:38 - Amin: Mushroom be more in touch with your body I recommend
27/07/17, 14:38 - Janith: 😂 oh we're gonna get along splendid
27/07/17, 14:38 - Janith: Why are you calling her a fungus?
27/07/17, 14:39 - Amin: Ok you can have mushroom, I never go that low
27/07/17, 14:39 - Amin: She said I can
27/07/17, 14:39 - Janith: No I mean what's the basis for the nickname
27/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Does it mean admins can control you? 😂😂

27/07/17, 14:41 - Amin: I think deep house combined with metal and poprock
27/07/17, 14:41 - Infected: I get along with most people on a superficial basis.
27/07/17, 14:41 - Amin: I cunt you in 😅
27/07/17, 14:41 - Janith: I'll check them out

28/07/17, 00:01 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 01:07 - Infected: It's a play on words. Dorian Grey is a character in 50 shades of grey.

28/07/17, 01:46 - Didier: 😂

28/07/17, 02:11 - Tahnacious: Google says Oscar Wilde, yes.
28/07/17, 02:11 - Tahnacious: Apparently there was a bad movie made from the book in 2009.
28/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: Interesting. Well at least it's a relief to know the reason I didn't understand that wasn't completely because I'm an idiot 😂
28/07/17, 02:15 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: that still doesn't justify the joke
28/07/17, 02:15 - ‪+504 9730-3509‬: yeah, im having trouble too
28/07/17, 02:16 - Tahnacious: I joined after the joke so I feel like I'm either lucky or missing out.

28/07/17, 04:06 - Tel: Because rank is illogical. It doesn't necessarily help get to the best result.

28/07/17, 17:06 - Tahnacious: Well I guess you can take that in to account
28/07/17, 17:07 - Tahnacious: Who has a perfect body after having a kid anyway?! Hah
28/07/17, 17:07 - Maureen: my sister has 😱
28/07/17, 17:07 - Tahnacious: There's a reason why I'm quite on the fence about children.
28/07/17, 17:08 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: The pill never disappoints,  but isn't it a problem on the time you will start trying for one @61477394075?  @4915127175996 all beautiful packed women get asked that question, like what's happening under the oven hey 😁😂
28/07/17, 17:08 - Tahnacious: I don't really think I'll be truing for one soon hah, just pretending to try. ;)
28/07/17, 17:09 - Tahnacious: *trying
28/07/17, 17:09 - Lulu: TBH I don't even pretend to act socially competent I just react how I want to react
28/07/17, 17:09 - Tahnacious: Heck, I could even be a bitch about it... Man asks can we try for kids, I say "sure" and I don't stop the pill >.> more sex for me.
28/07/17, 17:10 - Lulu: Like oh cool man enjoy that
28/07/17, 17:10 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
28/07/17, 17:10 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha as lucky as the dude is, I hope I do t go through that when I'm serious.  Having to raise a new being seems hella dramatic,  I can't commit to an idea more than a minute,  what more a baby
28/07/17, 17:10 - Tahnacious: Nice
28/07/17, 17:10 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I hear ya
28/07/17, 17:10 - Maureen: I'd love to have children
28/07/17, 17:11 - Maureen: I just can't imagine being pregnant
28/07/17, 17:11 - Maureen: or pushing a baby out of my vagina
28/07/17, 17:11 - Tahnacious: How does one quote what another has said previously?
28/07/17, 17:11 - Lulu: Like I am a genuinely friendly person but I'm not gonna pretend to be excited over something when I'm not at all
28/07/17, 17:11 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: They don't make them like you anymore. You awesome 😂😁
28/07/17, 17:11 - Tahnacious: Yeah, that idea is incredibly scary to me
28/07/17, 17:11 - Lulu: Or having it cut out of you
28/07/17, 17:12 - Tahnacious: Pssssh I just ignore the womanly convention that we aren't supposed to enjoy it or are supposed to use it as a tool to get what we want.
28/07/17, 17:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I was cut out
28/07/17, 17:12 - Maureen: stay on the message you want to quote and tip the left wing arrow
28/07/17, 17:12 - Lulu: So was i
28/07/17, 17:12 - Lulu: As was my brother
28/07/17, 17:13 - Maureen: I was pushed out...
28/07/17, 17:13 - Tahnacious: Like this?
28/07/17, 17:13 - Tahnacious: Ooooo
28/07/17, 17:13 - Tahnacious: Cooool....
28/07/17, 17:13 - Lulu: My brother came out before me tho
28/07/17, 17:13 - Tahnacious: I discovered a thing. Thank you
28/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: 😂😂 never too late to learn
28/07/17, 17:13 - Tahnacious: :D
28/07/17, 17:14 - Maureen: I mean, a c-section sounds cool but I've heard that you have the same pain after the birth as a pusher has during
28/07/17, 17:14 - Maureen: - by a mom who had both
28/07/17, 17:14 - Tahnacious: Reminds me of Alien
28/07/17, 17:14 - Maureen: you're welcome 😘
28/07/17, 17:14 - Tahnacious: My mum was cut and they didn't stitch her belly back together properly
28/07/17, 17:15 - Tahnacious: The muscles were all oooops all over the place
28/07/17, 17:15 - Tahnacious: So she could no longer use them to support herself... She uses to be a dancer and very fit
28/07/17, 17:15 - Tahnacious: *used
28/07/17, 17:15 - Lulu: My mom ended up needing to get her uterus out from likely complications after my birth
28/07/17, 17:15 - Tahnacious: But now she's like...nope
28/07/17, 17:16 - Tahnacious: I'm an only child, for other reasons
28/07/17, 17:16 - Lulu: Only reason we know that IE the fibroid growing on her uterus had calcium deposits that they could not cut through when they tried removing the tumor
28/07/17, 17:16 - Tahnacious: Eeek
28/07/17, 17:16 - Lulu: Aka it had been growing for years
28/07/17, 17:16 - Lulu: Lol
28/07/17, 17:16 - Maureen: I'm going to foster-adopt kids 💪🏻
28/07/17, 17:17 - Lulu: Same most likely if I ever get to it
28/07/17, 17:17 - Infected: Being pregnant is weird. It's not exactly fun but it's not the most uncomfortable sensation in the world. Labor is very uncomfortable but it ends in a few hours, generally. The worst part for me was having to sit on a pillow for 3 weeks.
28/07/17, 17:17 - Tahnacious: Good luck and a nice aspiration too, I could never do that.
28/07/17, 17:18 - Tahnacious: I've heard they cut slits around the outside to get the baby out if you don't get a c-section
28/07/17, 17:18 - Tahnacious: That to me is enough for me to nope out of a situation.
28/07/17, 17:19 - Lulu: I think that's only if u can't push it out
28/07/17, 17:19 - Lulu: Either that or it rips on its own
28/07/17, 17:19 - Tahnacious: I got baby pushing hips so I guess I'd be fine haha
28/07/17, 17:19 - Maureen: my best friend in elementary school was a foster kid. so I was in contact with that concept for a long time.
also I worked in a school for the past year and what I heard about foster/adopted kids was inspiring.
you literally safe lives.  lives of the most innocent.
28/07/17, 17:19 - Infected: Vaginal birth, you mean? Yes, they cut you so that your vagina doesn't rip apart when the baby comes out.
28/07/17, 17:20 - Lulu: My aunts ripped
28/07/17, 17:20 - Maureen: they also pull it out
28/07/17, 17:20 - Lulu: On her third child I think?
28/07/17, 17:20 - Tahnacious: I don't know which sounds scarier...😣
28/07/17, 17:21 - Maureen: with a plunger
28/07/17, 17:21 - Infected: My son came too fast, apparently and I didn't have time to get the episiotomy. I had several stitches that were quite uncomfortable.
28/07/17, 17:21 - Lulu: I've never even had a surgery so any kind of cutting me open sounds fucking horrible
28/07/17, 17:21 - Tahnacious: I've had wisdom teeth out so I can tell you from that experience it was hell... But apparently I had it much worse than average
28/07/17, 17:22 - Infected: I can guarantee you that at the time, you won't care that you're being cut open. You feel like your middle body is being ripped apart by war horses. You kind of just want the baby out.
28/07/17, 17:22 - Lulu: See my wisdom grew straight but  I had a crowded mouth so they still came out
28/07/17, 17:22 - Lulu: I also had two extra wisdom teeth
28/07/17, 17:22 - Tahnacious: You're making me think I should hop off the fence and on to the nopenopenope I don't want kids side.
28/07/17, 17:23 - Lulu: They were still in my gums so they just cut em out
28/07/17, 17:23 - Lulu: I was hyped when I learned I had 6 wisdom teeth lol
28/07/17, 17:23 - Tahnacious: Mine were in my gums too but they were kinda not moving and rotting so they had to come out.
28/07/17, 17:24 - Infected: There are a lot of factors to consider before deciding to have children. I didn't consider any of those factors as I was drunk at the time of conception.
28/07/17, 17:24 - Tahnacious: Why can't we just have like a baby chamber that we carry with us instead of having it in our belly... Lol
28/07/17, 17:24 - Lulu: Shit if that happened to me I'd take a plan b
28/07/17, 17:25 - Lulu: Like NOPE
28/07/17, 17:25 - Tahnacious: Me too haha
28/07/17, 17:25 - Infected: I've read on Facebook that they are developing those baby chambers already.
28/07/17, 17:25 - Tahnacious: Thank the hypothetical lord
28/07/17, 17:26 - Tahnacious: I am waiting for that then
28/07/17, 17:26 - Infected: I didn't enjoy being pregnant or going through labor but I do like my child quite a bit. It seems like it was worth the discomfort. At least, when he's not acting like an insane badger.
28/07/17, 17:26 - Maureen: do you have baby names?
28/07/17, 17:26 - Lulu: Not sure what baby chambers is but TBH I'll look it up later don't rly care ATM lol
28/07/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Even though I want no babies I have names lil
28/07/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Even middle
28/07/17, 17:27 - Lulu: I have no middle name myself
28/07/17, 17:27 - Maureen: me too 😂
28/07/17, 17:27 - Tahnacious: Just imagine the concept of a little mechanical uterus that your baby is deposited in after conception.
28/07/17, 17:27 - Tahnacious: I have no names thought of
28/07/17, 17:27 - Lulu: I only have girl names and a weird boy name
28/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: I have gender neutral names
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: All their middle names are flowers
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: Scarlet rose
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: Ember Lily
28/07/17, 17:28 - Tahnacious: If I had a kid if be very adamant that I don't want it a common nor a stupid name.
28/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: and gender specific middle names
28/07/17, 17:28 - Tahnacious: *it to be a common
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: Then this one is very on the fence and he'd hate me for this or love me
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: But Danny dandelion
28/07/17, 17:28 - Tahnacious: Sorry, sentence derpage.
28/07/17, 17:28 - Lulu: Or Daniel
28/07/17, 17:28 - Maureen: but I also think about gender specific first names and gender neutral nicknames
28/07/17, 17:29 - Tahnacious: Sounds good but I think a man would be mortified at having a flower as his middle name.
28/07/17, 17:29 - Maureen: Mika
Juli
Maxi
Nikki
28/07/17, 17:29 - Maureen: all gender neutral over here
28/07/17, 17:29 - Lulu: Not the way I'd raise a that boy ❤❤❤
28/07/17, 17:29 - Lulu: Lol
28/07/17, 17:29 - Tahnacious: I had a guinea pig named Mika
28/07/17, 17:30 - Maureen: middle names: Franziska and Sophie for girls
Elias for a boy
28/07/17, 17:31 - Lulu: My first female name is based off of my fav color
28/07/17, 17:31 - Lulu: My second girl middle name is based off my fav flower
28/07/17, 17:31 - Tahnacious: I think I would sit down and write a list with my partner after marriage and figure it out from there
28/07/17, 17:31 - Maureen: Rosa/Rose as a middle name would also be perfect since Rosa was my grandmothers name
28/07/17, 17:31 - Lulu: And imagine embers and a Lily
28/07/17, 17:31 - Lulu: Rad af man
28/07/17, 17:32 - Maureen: I also had a inspiring great aunt who's name was Rosa Franziska
28/07/17, 17:32 - Lulu: Rosa is a beautiful name
28/07/17, 17:32 - Tahnacious: That's cool
28/07/17, 17:33 - Maureen: let's see what my cousins do within the next years 😂
28/07/17, 17:34 - Lulu: Since I won't have kids I'll probably just draw up some oc'S with the names give them q backstory maybe a comic
28/07/17, 17:35 - Tahnacious: Yeah that sounds good to me haha
28/07/17, 17:35 - Maureen: my names are common names for my sims 🙈
28/07/17, 17:35 - Infected: I don't see the appeal of marriage.
28/07/17, 17:35 - Maureen: marriage is ownership
28/07/17, 17:35 - Tahnacious: I used to play that so much as a kid... I used to make myself one character, my crush the other character and then name all the babies suave names.
28/07/17, 17:35 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
28/07/17, 17:36 - Lulu: I did name one of scarlet for a sim
28/07/17, 17:36 - Maureen: I can't play one character for a long time
28/07/17, 17:36 - Tahnacious: I see it as a legal binding thing that's hard to get out of. Something I would never agree to leave.
28/07/17, 17:37 - Tahnacious: I created different worlds with different mes and different crushes xD
28/07/17, 17:37 - Lulu: I wouldn't mind getting married
28/07/17, 17:37 - Lulu: Like later in life
28/07/17, 17:38 - Maureen: I don't know. if it's the 100% right person. but I want it to be forever. no matter what.
28/07/17, 17:38 - Tahnacious: Yeah, me too if I found the right guy.
28/07/17, 17:38 - Lulu: We'd need to be engaged for at least 3 years
28/07/17, 17:38 - Tahnacious: Exactly
28/07/17, 17:38 - Lulu: Maybe more depending on circumstances
28/07/17, 17:38 - Maureen: I heard 4 years
28/07/17, 17:38 - Maureen: that's when you know each other completely
28/07/17, 17:39 - Maureen: oh, relationship of 4 years
28/07/17, 17:39 - Infected: I've never dated anyone that I could see myself marrying.  My relationships don't generally last more than 6 months to a year, though. I just don't enjoy romantic involvement.
28/07/17, 17:39 - Tahnacious: 1 year dating then engagement for 3 years...? Sounds like someone got engaged too fast
28/07/17, 17:39 - Lulu: I've never dated anyone
28/07/17, 17:40 - Tahnacious: I've never had a relationship short than 2 years
28/07/17, 17:40 - Tahnacious: *shorter
28/07/17, 17:40 - Maureen: well 4 years relationship, then engange
28/07/17, 17:40 - Lulu: Nah wouldn't accept engagement until like 2 or 3 years
28/07/17, 17:40 - Maureen: I never had a relationship
28/07/17, 17:40 - Tahnacious: Yeah those figures sound better
28/07/17, 17:40 - Lulu: Same
28/07/17, 17:41 - Maureen: how do you gals do dating?
28/07/17, 17:41 - Tahnacious: I find it hard not to be in a relationship. It's nice to know someone wants or accepts me
28/07/17, 17:41 - Lulu: I haven't
28/07/17, 17:41 - Lulu: Ha
28/07/17, 17:41 - Tahnacious: Well I don't go out and meet people, that's #1
28/07/17, 17:41 - Tahnacious: XD
28/07/17, 17:41 - Maureen: I mean it can't be all my screwed up sexuality 😂
28/07/17, 17:41 - Tahnacious: They start predominately online
28/07/17, 17:42 - Tahnacious: Usually I just find someone I like online then go meet them.
28/07/17, 17:42 - Lulu: See same but more WA a standoffish crush
28/07/17, 17:42 - Infected: I haven't dated in nearly 4 years. I'm not sure how it works.
28/07/17, 17:42 - Lulu: As a*
28/07/17, 17:42 - Tahnacious: Or it could be a friend of a friend
28/07/17, 17:43 - Lulu: As long as they'd be cool with naps as dates I'm in lol
28/07/17, 17:43 - Tahnacious: Sounds good. I'd be up for Netflix, chill, then just sleep
28/07/17, 17:43 - Tahnacious: Save the action for first thing in the morning haha
28/07/17, 17:44 - Lulu: Loll
28/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: I usually fall for friends
28/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: doesn't make it easy
28/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: never worked
28/07/17, 17:44 - Tahnacious: Unfortunately my only male friend doesn't meet my relationship standards
28/07/17, 17:44 - Lulu: Ahhhhhhh I just have intense crushes
28/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: I'm gay 😂
28/07/17, 17:44 - Maureen: yep
28/07/17, 17:44 - Tahnacious: Awww :(
28/07/17, 17:45 - Tahnacious: I'm bi, but never had a relationship with a girl, just one night things....
28/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: I hope to see more guys in college
28/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: I didn't like highschool or see potential
28/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: Like yes but no
28/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: Aka more intense crushew
28/07/17, 17:45 - Tahnacious: I didn't date in highschool. Everyone was a tool
28/07/17, 17:45 - Lulu: BASICALLY
28/07/17, 17:46 - Tahnacious: I had many crushes but nope, I was too weird for them
28/07/17, 17:46 - Lulu: I almost told my crush they smelled nice yesterday
28/07/17, 17:46 - Tahnacious: I was that weirdo who played video games before it became socially acceptable/desirable for girls to do so
28/07/17, 17:46 - Lulu: Like I was holding myself back
28/07/17, 17:46 - Lulu: I was like "nononono don't do it"
28/07/17, 17:46 - Maureen: I had a thing when I was 15/16, but afterwards I wasn't very social
28/07/17, 17:47 - Tahnacious: Oh ya, I have problems with compliments. I am too afraid of scaring people with what I notice
28/07/17, 17:47 - Lulu: He's so damn cutebahhhhhh
28/07/17, 17:47 - Maureen: why didn't you?
28/07/17, 17:47 - Tahnacious: Wish I talked to cute guys :( I find it hard to be attracted to anyone
28/07/17, 17:48 - Lulu: Because he had to return an item for me and if I'd said that then waited for him to return it
28/07/17, 17:48 - Maureen: I mean, it's totally normal to notice stuff
28/07/17, 17:48 - Infected: Same.
28/07/17, 17:48 - Lulu: I'd have it seething in the back of my heqd
28/07/17, 17:48 - Lulu: Burning*
28/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: I dunno, I reckon it would be giving off a creeper vibe
28/07/17, 17:48 - Infected: I don't like people in general. I'm often not aware if someone is interested in me. When I do realize it, it's an instant turn off.
28/07/17, 17:48 - Lulu: I wish I did tell him tho
28/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: Like... *inhale* mmmmm you smell so nice....
28/07/17, 17:49 - Lulu: Like I tell people they smell nice all the time
28/07/17, 17:49 - Maureen: I worked with my crush and I told her all the time that I loved her hair and how nice she looks
28/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: I just never realise someone is interested in me.
28/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: At all
28/07/17, 17:49 - Maureen: same
28/07/17, 17:49 - Maureen: but I'm also the person who attracts creepy guys
28/07/17, 17:50 - Lulu: Yeah but girl to girl compliments seem to have a different tone from girl to guy compliments in a societal sense
28/07/17, 17:50 - Maureen: who tell me years later that they had a crush on me
28/07/17, 17:50 - Infected: I'm not going to be interested in the males that are interested in me. The males I'm interested in are usually fictional characters.
28/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: "Man you know John still talks about you"

"Huh why?"

"Oh he had the biggest crush on you"

"Whaaaaa...? Since when?"
28/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: Lol
28/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: After I no longer have any contact with said person
28/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: Also heard on the grapevine guys "pining" over how they wished they had just "hit it" -.-
28/07/17, 17:51 - Lulu: Said guy went to highschool with me, we also work together
28/07/17, 17:51 - Lulu: We also both graduated
28/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: I relate to this 100%
28/07/17, 17:51 - Lulu: I hold. No hope for it because life will inevitably get in the way but crushes fill the emotional voir
28/07/17, 17:51 - Lulu: Void
28/07/17, 17:51 - Lulu: So yay
28/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: I have crushes on fictional characters 99.9% of the time
28/07/17, 17:52 - Infected: ^ yes.
28/07/17, 17:52 - Tahnacious: And I always thought that meant something was wrong with me :(
28/07/17, 17:52 - Infected: I often compare potential dating partners to fictional characters I have/had crushes one.
28/07/17, 17:53 - Tahnacious: Yeah that's the hard part
28/07/17, 17:53 - Tahnacious: But right now I'm lonely and want some action. I live alone in a 2br house
28/07/17, 17:54 - Infected: I'm well aware that it's not normal. I'm also aware that I don't care. I get more fulfillment out of reading books than spending time with males.
28/07/17, 17:54 - Tahnacious: I like otome games, if I imagine hard enough it's almost like I'm actually dating... Lol
28/07/17, 17:54 - Maureen: there is a difference between fictional and personal for me. like I objectify fictional characters and i respect real people more than I could ever objectify them
28/07/17, 17:55 - Maureen: I had imaginary friends who I "dated" when I was in school 😂
28/07/17, 17:55 - Tahnacious: Yeah me too, it was so sad. I used to make the bed for them next to me >_<
28/07/17, 17:56 - Tahnacious: I even said goodnight and stuff... Uuuughhh
28/07/17, 17:56 - Maureen: I hold hands with them and hugged them
28/07/17, 17:56 - Maureen: yeah me too
28/07/17, 17:56 - Tahnacious: I have a love pillow in my bed hah...
28/07/17, 17:56 - Maureen: like a relationship
28/07/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: Right next to me currently
28/07/17, 17:57 - Maureen: at some point I dressed a pillow 😂
28/07/17, 17:57 - Infected: I'm more likely to be sexually attracted to a fictional character than a real person. I think the reason lies in that there is no mystery or question to the words you read on a page. You can see the vision of who and what they are clearly written. Actual men are often too confusing, emotional, and manipulative for my tastes. I can't even begin to get sexually attracted to someone that gives me a headache.
28/07/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: I've definitely considered it
28/07/17, 17:58 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I hate manipulative types... And guys who start crying over stupid things.
28/07/17, 17:58 - Maureen: I knew I couldn't be with a man before I knew I was into women

28/07/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Whalecum
28/07/17, 18:00 - Maureen: welcome to the trip
28/07/17, 18:00 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: Hello
28/07/17, 18:00 - Infected: Greetings.
28/07/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: I find it funny how many females we have here and yet female INTPs are said to be rarer.
28/07/17, 18:01 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: True :)
28/07/17, 18:01 - Infected: I think female intp'intp's must be more likely to cluster than males.
28/07/17, 18:01 - Infected: Intp's*
28/07/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: Possibly. It's nice though, I appreciate it. I find it very hard to communicate with girls normally.
28/07/17, 18:02 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: Girls I'm around talk about the most mundane things...
28/07/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: They're mostly ExFx which drives me nuts
28/07/17, 18:03 - Maureen: I can talk to older women and younger girls
28/07/17, 18:03 - Maureen: just not girls my age
28/07/17, 18:03 - Maureen: not many though
28/07/17, 18:03 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: I find it easier to talk to older people.
28/07/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I can talk to anyone of any age but it doesn't mean I'll connect... At all
28/07/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I'd say the same.
28/07/17, 18:04 - Maureen: my crush is one person my age I can talk to. she's an ISTP so she doesn't text back, which drives me crazy
28/07/17, 18:04 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: Well, it just starts with a few words, like we're doing now.
28/07/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: I'm terrible at replying.
28/07/17, 18:04 - Maureen: I need to reply immediately
28/07/17, 18:04 - Maureen: so I can't understand the opposite
28/07/17, 18:05 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: I feel ya.
28/07/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 18:05 - Infected: The majority of females are feelers. They want to talk about boyfriends, drama, and their bosses being jerks or who is sexy in their office. *shudder*
28/07/17, 18:05 - Maureen: and I communicate a lot over tecting5
28/07/17, 18:05 - Maureen: texting
28/07/17, 18:05 - Infected: Same.
28/07/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: I have the impulse to projectile vomit
28/07/17, 18:06 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: That's an exaggeration
28/07/17, 18:06 - Tahnacious: Yeah texting works way better for me than anything else.
28/07/17, 18:06 - Maureen: mostly seconds, not often 3 days later. but theres no I'm between 🙈
28/07/17, 18:06 - Tahnacious: you got me, lol
28/07/17, 18:07 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: :) So, who are all of you guys?
28/07/17, 18:07 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 18:07 - Lulu: Most girls talk about petty shit and mundane things
28/07/17, 18:07 - Tahnacious: I'm just a random.
28/07/17, 18:07 - Infected: My "bff" is a feeler. I have to chameleon my ass off when conversing with her.
28/07/17, 18:07 - Lulu: At least guys make funny jokes, stupid but funny
28/07/17, 18:07 - Maureen: Maureen, 24, german, translator

28/07/17, 18:08 - Tahnacious: Tahnee, 25, Australian, works many jobs but all of them suck (also student)
28/07/17, 18:09 - Lulu: Luc- oops, Lulu 😉, 18, cashier at a retail store and starting college this year

28/07/17, 18:09 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: U.S too.
28/07/17, 18:09 - Tahnacious: +1 on phone number generally means U.S
28/07/17, 18:10 - Infected: Katie, 32, southern u.s., trash panda
28/07/17, 18:10 - Maureen: in my last 3 years of school I was in a class with 9 other girls (2 boys)
28/07/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: trash panda sounds epic
28/07/17, 18:10 - Lulu: 100%
28/07/17, 18:10 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: And adorable
28/07/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: I was in a class in high school... Software design and development. I was the only female :) I was happy.
28/07/17, 18:10 - Maureen: we were 18 girls/6 boys at the beginning...
I learned pretty fast to talk "girl"
28/07/17, 18:11 - Infected: Yes.
28/07/17, 18:11 - Lulu: Lol screw learning how to talk girl
28/07/17, 18:11 - Tahnacious: Yeah, F that noise.
28/07/17, 18:11 - Infected: It took me about 10 years to learn how to communicate with females.
28/07/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: "Like soooo did you hear about Jeremy and Amanda...?!?!? Oh. My. Gawd."

Please... Please no, make it stop.
28/07/17, 18:12 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: If I talk about hair and makeup to most females, I'm usually good.
28/07/17, 18:12 - Lulu: If I liked ur shoes or thought you smelled nice or ur makeup or outfit looked on point Ima say it, I'm generally very friendly and I smile at everyone
28/07/17, 18:12 - Maureen: I could survive girls night
28/07/17, 18:12 - Lulu: But
28/07/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: I can't do hair and make up, it's too much of a struggle for me
28/07/17, 18:12 - Arne: If someone wonders why I might won't be online the coming two weeks: I'm on vacation, don't know if I got any time in Luxembourg

28/07/17, 18:13 - Maureen: me too
28/07/17, 18:13 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 18:13 - Tahnacious: I usually plait my hair to stop it from getting knotty
28/07/17, 18:13 - Lulu: When I try makeup I end up doing some stupid shit like this
28/07/17, 18:13 - Maureen: wow
28/07/17, 18:13 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: It looks nice.
28/07/17, 18:14 - Infected: Honestly, I just started pretending I was a drag queen when talking to other women. I channeled Patrick Swayze in a dress.
28/07/17, 18:14 - Tahnacious: Someone did my make up like that once, so I guess I can relate
28/07/17, 18:14 - Lulu: The filter made the blue pop out so I worked with it!
28/07/17, 18:14 - Lulu: The curl tied it all together
28/07/17, 18:15 - Lulu: I do makeup more for the sake or art and Less for daily wear
28/07/17, 18:15 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: I should try channeling my inner Patrick Swayze when in a dress talking talking to others.
28/07/17, 18:15 - Infected: I'm good at makeup but it's boring to me. I just do my hair by spraying hair spray in its general direction and shake my head.
28/07/17, 18:15 - Lulu: Reasons why I end up smearing shit all over my facr
28/07/17, 18:16 - Lulu: More fun
28/07/17, 18:16 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: My hair is in braids so I don't have to do my hair in the morning. A time saver!
28/07/17, 18:17 - Lulu: I wish I could braid mines I'm bad at it
28/07/17, 18:17 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 18:17 - Lulu: But I just let my curls flow free
28/07/17, 18:17 - Maureen: I love braiding
28/07/17, 18:17 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: Have someone else do it for you. Braiding is fun.
28/07/17, 18:18 - Maureen: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 18:18 - Infected: I prefer short hair that's just long enough to put in a ponytail.
28/07/17, 18:18 - Lulu: Alas like makeup it's a lot of work
28/07/17, 18:18 - Lulu: Although I do straighten my hair because I enjoy it
28/07/17, 18:19 - Lulu: I find it really calming
28/07/17, 18:19 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: 15 minutes at most for me for makeup.
28/07/17, 18:19 - Lulu: I just sit at my laptop and watch stuff quest straighten
28/07/17, 18:19 - Maureen: I don't need much time for make up and hair
28/07/17, 18:19 - Lulu: See I'm kind of a wake up shower and leave in perfect time girl so
28/07/17, 18:20 - Lulu: 15 mins cuts into valuable time making a healthy breakfast or showering or watching tv
28/07/17, 18:20 - Maureen: that style I just sent took 2 min
28/07/17, 18:20 - Lulu: Or something like chilling to music
28/07/17, 18:20 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: The opposite for me. I kinda have to get up 2 hours beforehand to work out, make breakfast, and then get ready.

28/07/17, 18:21 - Lulu: I need to eat before I workout or else I'll be too weak to do it effectively
28/07/17, 18:22 - ‪+1 (630) 542-7990‬: Either or for me.
28/07/17, 18:22 - Maureen: I get sick when I eat before workout
28/07/17, 18:22 - Lulu: Just don't eat too much

28/07/17, 18:23 - Lulu: I need to make a routine of working out
28/07/17, 18:23 - Maureen: when I work out in the morning I don't eat before

28/07/17, 18:27 - Maureen: the best is sore abs
28/07/17, 18:27 - Tahnacious: When it's my butt and thighs it means I gotta hold things to stand up haha
28/07/17, 18:27 - Tahnacious: Yeah I love sore abs haha
28/07/17, 18:27 - Lulu: I don't think I've had a good workout unless I'm dripping sweat

28/07/17, 19:16 - FABIO: they were all crazy
28/07/17, 19:16 - Tahnacious: Oh, I don't necessarily enjoy it more but I can still cum off it. Its mostly to do with how much the guy is in to it.
28/07/17, 19:16 - Tahnacious: I am very Fe when it comes to sex. All I want is to please the other person. That's what gets me off.
28/07/17, 19:17 - Lulu: I think the thing with analyze for women is that is help stimulate certain " parts "

28/07/17, 19:24 - Infected: At some point, I turned dating into a game. If someone asked me out, I would go. They would become interested in me and I would tell them not to call me again. I'm an asshole, really.
28/07/17, 19:25 - Tahnacious: I believe if I somehow grew a beard I'd be less hot rather than more hot. Lmao!
28/07/17, 19:25 - Tahnacious: I've done that exact thing... Teehee

28/07/17, 19:29 - Tahnacious: Yeah Lulu yours look about right hah
28/07/17, 19:29 - Infected: No, it's because they want to have sex with me, usually. I go robot when someone starts trying to aggressively pursue that avenue of behavior. I calculate their level of genuine interest and if it's below a certain point, I blow them off. Someone that is genuinely interested in me has an even greater chance of getting ghosted.
28/07/17, 19:30 - FABIO: thats why you do the dumping
28/07/17, 19:30 - FABIO: hahahahaha
28/07/17, 19:30 - Tahnacious: Lol because I look like I could maim someone?

28/07/17, 19:33 - FABIO: hahahah.. thanks
28/07/17, 19:33 - Tahnacious: I do
28/07/17, 19:33 - Tahnacious: On my neck
28/07/17, 19:33 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Well thatsyif he was still alive.
28/07/17, 19:33 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 19:34 - Infected: I honestly don't know why I get asked out as much as I do. I have an unpleasant personality and I'm not generally speaking, that attractive.
28/07/17, 19:35 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: See this. This is a girl I'd totally make out with at the back of a restaurant any given Friday 😻😍😍😻
28/07/17, 19:35 - Lulu: Lol
28/07/17, 19:36 - Tahnacious: >_< lol!
28/07/17, 19:36 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Would you be surprised if I said I'm attracted to that kind of behaviour.  Because all other girls seems mediocre and boring, yet yoll play messed up games
28/07/17, 19:36 - Tahnacious: I've never made out with anyone at the back of a restaurant :(
28/07/17, 19:36 - Tahnacious: My whole life is a lie... Lol
28/07/17, 19:36 - Infected: Is this a cosplay?
28/07/17, 19:36 - Tahnacious: I don't really do games but I do do one off dates.
28/07/17, 19:37 - Tahnacious: Yes, Katarina from League of Legends.
28/07/17, 19:37 - FABIO: on top of a bilhar tabble
28/07/17, 19:37 - FABIO: :3
28/07/17, 19:37 - Tahnacious: Even better!
28/07/17, 19:37 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/07/17, 19:37 - Infected: I play games with men that try to play games with me because it's fun to see their reaction when they realize I'm smarter than they are.
28/07/17, 19:38 - Infected: ❤
28/07/17, 19:38 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha me too. But eye contact would get us there,  I mean just looks ay you
28/07/17, 19:38 - Tahnacious: Lmao! I can definitely appreciate that statement!
28/07/17, 19:38 - Tahnacious: What's that? Eye contact? That's the hard part :( haha
28/07/17, 19:38 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 19:38 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: What if they not playing a game. And you think it's a game?
28/07/17, 19:39 - FABIO: dont find it
28/07/17, 19:39 - FABIO: always look in the eye
28/07/17, 19:39 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: That mindset is sexy. But relax, not everything is a game
28/07/17, 19:39 - Infected: I know when someone has a genuine interest in dating me. I tell them politely that I'm not interested.
28/07/17, 19:40 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I love eye contact.  It tells me when and when not to approach someone.  If I catch you looking, I'll approach otherwise no. Some will blow you off, and I hate having to go through that
28/07/17, 19:41 - Tahnacious: I find it sexy when a guy can actually keep up.
28/07/17, 19:41 - Tahnacious: I rarely blow people off, I always give someone a chance at least. I'm just shy, the more attractive the person the more shy I am.
28/07/17, 19:42 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I have this girl who probably thinks I cancelled on her purposefully yesterday. Kinda has you mindset,  I don't know how to keep up because now she's ignoring my calls
28/07/17, 19:42 - Tahnacious: So if someone nice comes up to me and starts talking I will be scared to look directly at them because I worry they will assume I'm checking them out
28/07/17, 19:42 - Infected: I don't date in a serious capacity. I'm not looking for a life partner and I feel it would be unfair to go out with someone that has a genuine interest in me. I quit dating four years ago because playing the players got boring.
28/07/17, 19:43 - Tahnacious: Sometimes I date people I'm not interested in simply because I know it would make them good to spend a day with me
28/07/17, 19:43 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha I know what you talking about. Attractive people are totally impatient!  and I only get to think of the perfect thing to say after that encounter
28/07/17, 19:43 - Tahnacious: In those situations I always demand we split costs equally
28/07/17, 19:44 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Checking them out. In the eyes, haha there's no such thing Tahnee
28/07/17, 19:44 - Tahnacious: Totally relatable! I hate that... Perfect response just 30 minutes too late.
28/07/17, 19:44 - FABIO: you guys
28/07/17, 19:44 - FABIO: overcomplicate everything
28/07/17, 19:44 - FABIO: omg
28/07/17, 19:44 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/07/17, 19:44 - Tahnacious: What? Someone can have sexy eyes which makes me anxious if I look directly at them...
28/07/17, 19:45 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Whoa you are a bad ass chick. Haha playing players, then start going for the coaches
28/07/17, 19:46 - FABIO: i never understood this game.. or wathever
28/07/17, 19:46 - FABIO: what i started to do.. is having other interestes
28/07/17, 19:46 - FABIO: girls would call.. i would be busy doing something
28/07/17, 19:46 - Lulu: I play with people cuz its fun
28/07/17, 19:46 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I feel like that's builds more attraction.  The eyes are the window to ones soul remember
28/07/17, 19:46 - FABIO: in the end.. when i reply.. they would want sex
28/07/17, 19:47 - FABIO: i found something.. i love more... than my own life
28/07/17, 19:47 - FABIO: ENGINEERING ❤ ❤ ❤
28/07/17, 19:47 - FABIO: hahahaha
28/07/17, 19:47 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: The game is over complicated.  I can't keep up too, I just happen to sometimes
28/07/17, 19:48 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha you never had toys as a kid did you
28/07/17, 19:48 - FABIO: hahahahahahah
28/07/17, 19:48 - Infected: I just want to live in my own world, uninterrupted by other people.
28/07/17, 19:48 - FABIO: i didnt have friends... as a kid
28/07/17, 19:48 - Tahnacious: I have toys, in my bedside table.
28/07/17, 19:48 - Tahnacious: Lol
28/07/17, 19:49 - Lulu: I did, but if someone wants to play with you why not play along
28/07/17, 19:49 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 19:49 - Tahnacious: That's true
28/07/17, 19:49 - FABIO: my table
28/07/17, 19:49 - FABIO: =D
28/07/17, 19:49 - Lulu: Life is boring
28/07/17, 19:49 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Me too. Still blame my over protection for that
28/07/17, 19:49 - Tahnacious: Nice :)
28/07/17, 19:50 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I played that game too. But it's messed up how it affects people
28/07/17, 19:50 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 19:50 - Infected: Same.
28/07/17, 19:50 - Tahnacious: My TV setup
28/07/17, 19:50 - FABIO: my little pony
28/07/17, 19:50 - FABIO: HAHAHAHA
28/07/17, 19:50 - Tahnacious: I know!!!
28/07/17, 19:51 - FABIO: i watched... a lot
28/07/17, 19:51 - FABIO: ahahahaha
28/07/17, 19:51 - Tahnacious: Some guy said he wanted me to have a build a bear and I was like uhhh you sure?
28/07/17, 19:51 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I play as long as I can. Thing is some folks get sensitive hey
28/07/17, 19:51 - Tahnacious: I went in, couldn't find one I wanted so I was like fuck it, I'll have rainbow dash.
28/07/17, 19:52 - Infected: Build a bears are cool.
28/07/17, 19:52 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: What the heck is that boo
28/07/17, 19:52 - FABIO: RICK AND MORTY
28/07/17, 19:52 - FABIO: =D
28/07/17, 19:52 - Tahnacious: <3

28/07/17, 19:53 - Lulu: Rick and Morty is fun
28/07/17, 19:53 - Lulu: Ny
28/07/17, 19:53 - Tahnacious: Build a bears are plushies that you self fill.
28/07/17, 19:54 - Lulu: And put a heart. In
28/07/17, 19:54 - Lulu: There is a ritual
28/07/17, 19:54 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Most disturbing cartoons ever. Why can't that old man stop burping 😂😂😂
28/07/17, 19:54 - FABIO: its awesome dude
28/07/17, 19:54 - FABIO: best cartoon ever
28/07/17, 19:55 - Infected: One of my ex's gave me a build a bear. He said his wish was that I'd love him forever. I don't think I loved him when he gave it to me, tbh.
28/07/17, 19:56 - Infected: Llamas in hats is up there.
28/07/17, 19:56 - Tahnacious: Yeah I love llamas with hats
28/07/17, 19:56 - FABIO: the one with carl?
28/07/17, 19:56 - Tahnacious: And the ferrets one they did too.
28/07/17, 19:56 - Tahnacious: Yeah

28/07/17, 19:57 - Lulu: There are more disturbing things lol Rick and Morty is pretty tame
28/07/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: One of my ex's gave me one of those huge fuck off teddy bears almost bigger than me, I don't know what to do with it. :(
28/07/17, 19:57 - Infected: "I have a rumbly in my tumbly that only hands can satisfy."
28/07/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: Try pain Olympics.
28/07/17, 19:58 - Infected: Goodwill?
28/07/17, 19:58 - Tahnacious: Maybe... I'd feel bad though because we are still friends.
28/07/17, 19:59 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Only watched the first two seasons and I was content.  The director was disturbed reallly 🙉😂🙉😂
28/07/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: Almost as disturbed as me.
28/07/17, 19:59 - Infected: Why?
28/07/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: "Hey, so where did that bear go that I gave you, I dont see it anymore"

"Oh, I gave it away..."

"Oh... :("
28/07/17, 20:00 - FABIO: tryed to be friends with my ex
28/07/17, 20:00 - FABIO: didnt ended well
28/07/17, 20:00 - FABIO: almost cheated my girlfriend
28/07/17, 20:00 - FABIO: devilsh things... woman is
28/07/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: I dunno, I feel emotional attachment to plushies since I don't have humans I'm emotionally attached to.
28/07/17, 20:01 - FABIO: dont trust. you must
28/07/17, 20:01 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha I'm still here so I can't definitely deal with you boo, that show just became pointless u know?
28/07/17, 20:01 - Infected: I'm Facebook friends with several of my ex bf's/fiancé's/flings.
28/07/17, 20:01 - FABIO: ahh facebook is ok
28/07/17, 20:01 - FABIO: i dont use facebook for nothing besides the chat
28/07/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: Yeah, but it is kinda sad.
28/07/17, 20:01 - Infected: I feel that way over my animes.
28/07/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: I don't even have Facebook lol...
28/07/17, 20:02 - FABIO: how you have sex?
28/07/17, 20:02 - FABIO: GO OUT??
28/07/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: Only problem is animes usually end...at least the good ones do
28/07/17, 20:02 - FABIO: hahahahaha
28/07/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: I don't T____T
28/07/17, 20:02 - Infected: Facebook is my main stream of social interaction.
28/07/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: I'm a horny little ragamuffin who works, eats, works out, plays video games then sleeps.
28/07/17, 20:03 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: You can be talking friends with your ex. Anything more will cause complicats, trust me I know. There's just something your dick knows instinctively where it's been. It will what to get back there 😂😂 if entertained
28/07/17, 20:03 - Infected: The best ones only have one or two seasons. Where is the justice?
28/07/17, 20:03 - FABIO: hahah exactly
28/07/17, 20:03 - FABIO: if i wasnt in a relationship.. it would woks
28/07/17, 20:03 - Tahnacious: My ex is taken but I'm pretty sure he would still do me if given the opportunity.
28/07/17, 20:03 - FABIO: fuck if she has a boyfriend
28/07/17, 20:03 - FABIO: im bigger than hin
28/07/17, 20:03 - Infected: ^ This.
28/07/17, 20:04 - FABIO: but i have a girl...
28/07/17, 20:04 - FABIO: hahahahahaha
28/07/17, 20:04 - Tahnacious: I know... Maybe its the finiteness of it that makes it beautiful.
28/07/17, 20:04 - FABIO: all things must end
28/07/17, 20:04 - FABIO: i dont watch those who dont
28/07/17, 20:04 - FABIO: like naruto or one piece
28/07/17, 20:05 - Tahnacious: Yeah. I tried one piece. I like the concept but I don't have enough of a life to devote to that many episodes
28/07/17, 20:05 - FABIO: hey guys... im going to he glorious house of gains....
28/07/17, 20:05 - FABIO: SEE YA
28/07/17, 20:05 - Tahnacious: Just watching dragonball +dbz was enough
28/07/17, 20:05 - Tahnacious: Lucky you
28/07/17, 20:05 - Infected: I calculated it. On average, men will come back two years after we've "broken up" to make another play. I don't see the point of contacting someone you had a relationship with in the past.
28/07/17, 20:06 - Tahnacious: Yeeesh, I had better watch my back then.
28/07/17, 20:06 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha anyone would do you right now.  See thing about a us guys is it's easier not to resist because eitherway there's nothing to lose
28/07/17, 20:06 - Infected: I like Bleach.
28/07/17, 20:06 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: No one respects relationships these days! It's the most complicated position you can put yourself in
28/07/17, 20:06 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I know.
28/07/17, 20:07 - Tahnacious: Even more so when I tend to get in to online relationships
28/07/17, 20:07 - Tahnacious: Most real life guys say it doesn't count then proceed to try and touch me.
28/07/17, 20:07 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Love it. Goku goes overboard with his super saiyan God tendencies
28/07/17, 20:07 - Tahnacious: Yessss :)
28/07/17, 20:07 - Infected: I prefer online/ long distance relationships. It plays to my loner mentality.
28/07/17, 20:08 - Tahnacious: ^ this
28/07/17, 20:08 - Tahnacious: But it would be nice if sex happened. That's my only complaint... Lol
28/07/17, 20:08 - Infected: I don't want to be with someone that I have to see on a weekly basis.
28/07/17, 20:08 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 20:09 - FABIO: No pain no Haim.
28/07/17, 20:09 - FABIO: No pain. No gain. Hahahahaha
28/07/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: Yeah that's fair enough. People are exhausting
28/07/17, 20:09 - Infected: Exactly.
28/07/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: Even more so to live with. :(
28/07/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: Which is why I'm forever alone
28/07/17, 20:09 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: You two have a phobia for people,  how do you get laid of that's hehe case
28/07/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: You could probably use that bottle as a weight
28/07/17, 20:10 - Infected: I'm never living with a member of the opposite sex again lol
28/07/17, 20:10 - Tahnacious: I don't D:
28/07/17, 20:10 - Tahnacious: And it is currently driving me nuts!
28/07/17, 20:10 - Infected: I don't get laid. I watch hentai and read erotica.
28/07/17, 20:10 - Tahnacious: Anyone have a good eroge to recommend?
28/07/17, 20:11 - Tahnacious: Erotic visual novel with choice based elements...
28/07/17, 20:11 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Haha we can do online dating. I dint like attachments too
28/07/17, 20:11 - Infected: Nope lol
28/07/17, 20:11 - Tahnacious: Aw fuck, haha.
28/07/17, 20:12 - Infected: I'm waiting for sex robots to be a thing.
28/07/17, 20:12 - Tahnacious: Yes please, preferably programmed to suit your individualistic needs
28/07/17, 20:12 - Infected: Yes ^
28/07/17, 20:13 - Tahnacious: Either that or porn VR that has an AI tailored to you
28/07/17, 20:13 - Tahnacious: Looks and personality generated based on your input
28/07/17, 20:13 - Tahnacious: And you live an online life with an AI that you can seduce and bed, hah
28/07/17, 20:14 - Infected: Too complicated when you factor in sex toys for various operations.
28/07/17, 20:14 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Seems like you just looking for automated sex dolls
28/07/17, 20:14 - Tahnacious: Anywhere you want too... Sounds like heaven.
28/07/17, 20:14 - Tahnacious: I had an automatic thrusting dildo
28/07/17, 20:14 - Infected: That's what we said lol
28/07/17, 20:14 - Tahnacious: It broke :(
28/07/17, 20:14 - Infected: I would be into that.
28/07/17, 20:15 - Tahnacious: Yeah, just base the guy on an anime character of your choice
28/07/17, 20:15 - Tahnacious: And it learns, thinks and reacts as a real person would
28/07/17, 20:15 - Tahnacious: I think I'll clock out of real life forever once that becomes a thing.
28/07/17, 20:16 - Infected: Which character would you choose? I'd have a problem deciding.
28/07/17, 20:16 - Tahnacious: I'd probably make up an OC honestly, but he would have to be one of those tall intelligent types with long dark cascading hair.
28/07/17, 20:17 - Tahnacious: Ever played hakouki? I think that's how it's spelled...
28/07/17, 20:17 - Infected: They're making interactive waifus a thing. It's like Alexa but it's a small projection instead of a speaker and "she" sends you texts throughout the day.
28/07/17, 20:17 - Infected: No, idts
28/07/17, 20:18 - Tahnacious: Yeah I double checked... It's a game... I wouldn't mind a man like the main character from that.
28/07/17, 20:19 - Infected: I would probably do an OC, too. I like various aspects of different characters. Appearance wise, I might go with something like Sesshomaru.
28/07/17, 20:19 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 20:19 - Tahnacious: Oh, I love sesshomaru haha
28/07/17, 20:20 - Infected: Yes lol he has a certain appeal.
28/07/17, 20:20 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
28/07/17, 20:20 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: So likes that Joker and Harley relationship?
28/07/17, 20:20 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Who*?
28/07/17, 20:20 - Tahnacious: Yeah there's something you can't put a finger on...
28/07/17, 20:20 - Tahnacious: Eh, not me.
28/07/17, 20:21 - Infected: Not my thing.
28/07/17, 20:21 - Tahnacious: I want to at least appear sane to the outside viewer
28/07/17, 20:21 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I've always asked myself what kind of woman enjoyed being abused in a way. As sexy as they may appear to be
28/07/17, 20:22 - Tahnacious: That's me more realistically
28/07/17, 20:22 - Tahnacious: Not idealistically
28/07/17, 20:22 - Infected: I don't care about appearing sane but I'm not going to date someone as crazy as I am. I have responsibilities.
28/07/17, 20:22 - Tahnacious: Hahah
28/07/17, 20:23 - Tahnacious: There is a certain pull towards abusive relationships. I don't like it but I can't deny it
28/07/17, 20:23 - Tahnacious: Its probably because my first experiences with men were heavily abuse and manipulation orientated
28/07/17, 20:23 - Tahnacious: It makes it easy for someone like me to fall in line
28/07/17, 20:24 - Tahnacious: Its not what I want and not what I seek but I'm an innocent little puppy at heart and I'm easy to break
28/07/17, 20:24 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: 😂😂😂
28/07/17, 20:25 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Yeah you definitely do. Keep up with that
28/07/17, 20:26 - Infected: What?
28/07/17, 20:26 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: That's what's a man is made to do, give you that sense of protection and love, I still can't tell how it changes over time
28/07/17, 20:27 - Infected: Same.
28/07/17, 20:28 - Tahnacious: If a man is made to do is then why doesn't anyone do it for me? XD
28/07/17, 20:28 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Keep up with your responsibility.  If you dated someone as crazy as you are, you'd probably end up doing something as insane as sky diving without a parachute
28/07/17, 20:28 - Tahnacious: *it
28/07/17, 20:29 - Infected: Tbh, I'd already be going down that road if I weren't a parent.
28/07/17, 20:29 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: You fall for pick up artists most probably.  Otherwise a genuine person will give off a good impression,  either they keep it or don't. Only time can tskk
28/07/17, 20:29 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Tell *
28/07/17, 20:30 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Too pretty to be a parent 😋, what you doing right woman
28/07/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: My ex was an enfp, so he devolved to a yelling, domineering, lazy, forgetful pile of poop
28/07/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: Kept telling me I should get angry at him... He would be more comfy if I actually shared my negative emotions lol
28/07/17, 20:34 - Tahnacious: And I was like yuck, no.
28/07/17, 20:34 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Probably the type to love angry make up sex
28/07/17, 20:35 - Infected: Absolutely nothing and I couldn't be more content about it.
28/07/17, 20:35 - Infected: Ewwwww
28/07/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: I know, it was icky
28/07/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: I've never done that but I wouldn't be against trying. Any sex is good sex :) lol!
28/07/17, 20:38 - Infected: Pity sex is bad sex.
28/07/17, 20:39 - Tahnacious: Oh right... Ooops
28/07/17, 20:40 - Tahnacious: You're right there
28/07/17, 20:44 - Infected: 👍🏻
29/07/17, 00:05 - Tel: Like, why? I don't get why ppl are trying to be like the Kardashians.. I mean, if you like that and you're doing it for yourself, then fair enough. It can look odd though, just like Jordan went the wrong way way beforehand. Apols if interfering in your chat!
29/07/17, 00:11 - Tel: Lol! True that!
29/07/17, 00:26 - Tahnacious: I honestly done know how to make a butt a size of choice anyway.
29/07/17, 00:29 - Infected: There are a limited number of things you can do to enhance your butt. That's why a lot of people opt for surgery. It's also easier.
29/07/17, 00:30 - Tahnacious: Well I would never do such a thing, surgery is stupid... For appearance purposes under normal circumstances anyway.
29/07/17, 00:30 - Tahnacious: I can understand burn victims and such.
29/07/17, 00:30 - Tahnacious: I don't really think my butt can be enhanced one way or another through natural means
29/07/17, 00:30 - Tel: +1
29/07/17, 00:31 - Tel: Oh! Ppl are still up. I'm still catching up, as you can see
29/07/17, 00:31 - Infected: I don't knock people that decide to get plastic surgery. I just don't care enough to do it.
29/07/17, 00:31 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I exist somewhere.
29/07/17, 00:31 - Infected: Plus, poor.

29/07/17, 00:38 - Infected: I had cinnamon toast crunch for dinner.
29/07/17, 00:41 - Tahnacious: I'm jelly, I've been on a no sugar diet for a while now
29/07/17, 00:41 - Tahnacious: No artificial sugar anyway, fruit is fine.
29/07/17, 00:41 - FABIO: i have to gain mass
29/07/17, 00:41 - Infected: I should be on a diet, probably. Idgaf
29/07/17, 00:41 - FABIO: so i can eat whatever the fuck
29/07/17, 00:42 - Tahnacious: Yeah I don't need to gain mass, I'm like 36% muscle.
29/07/17, 00:43 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 00:44 - FABIO: 😂😂
29/07/17, 00:44 - Infected: I think I'm 60% fat atm.
29/07/17, 00:45 - Tahnacious: That's pretty extreme
29/07/17, 00:45 - Tahnacious: But you'd need to step on a special scale to be sure
29/07/17, 00:46 - Infected: Yeah, I'm a potato. It's pretty hard to lose weight when I just don't give a damn.
29/07/17, 00:47 - Tahnacious: Kitchen days...
29/07/17, 00:49 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>

29/07/17, 00:53 - Infected: I need a life coach that will just follow me around and poke me with a sharp stick when I eat junk food .
29/07/17, 00:53 - FABIO: I kill dragons for gold
29/07/17, 00:53 - FABIO: Hahaha
29/07/17, 00:53 - Tahnacious: Taller than the average girl, so no problem :)
29/07/17, 00:53 - FABIO: I dont bother
29/07/17, 00:53 - Tahnacious: I just don't buy junk food therefore I don't eat it haha

29/07/17, 00:54 - FABIO: Would be bigger

29/07/17, 01:00 - Infected: He is attractive.
29/07/17, 01:01 - FABIO: yes
29/07/17, 01:02 - Tahnacious: He has the hair but maybe too many muscles for my taste.
29/07/17, 01:02 - Tahnacious: I would still hit it though hah
29/07/17, 01:02 - FABIO: hhahahaha
29/07/17, 01:02 - FABIO: he has not too many muscle....
29/07/17, 01:03 - Lulu: Too much muscle for me
29/07/17, 01:03 - Lulu: Tbh
29/07/17, 01:03 - Tahnacious: For my taste though, meaning it is only my opinion.
29/07/17, 01:03 - Infected: He's not grotesquely large. He is a bit muscled up though.
29/07/17, 01:03 - Lulu: Eh
29/07/17, 01:03 - Lulu: He isn't unattractive
29/07/17, 01:03 - Lulu: I'm just not into the heavily muscled types
29/07/17, 01:04 - Tahnacious: I like just lightly defined
29/07/17, 01:04 - Tahnacious: Fit but not bulky
29/07/17, 01:04 - Tahnacious: Kinda like where Fabio is
29/07/17, 01:04 - FABIO: https://www.instagram.com/frank_mcgrath78/

29/07/17, 01:04 - Infected: Eh, I like anime guys. Pretty sure they'd look like soggy noodles irl
29/07/17, 01:05 - FABIO: my experience... all girls say this... all girls like seeing muscles...
29/07/17, 01:06 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 01:06 - FABIO: hahahahhaa
29/07/17, 01:08 - Tahnacious: Haha
29/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: I like it when a guy has the tall physique of an anime man
29/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: But has to be broad enough to be able to protect me
29/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: All my ex's I was able to beat in an arm wrestle
29/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: That's not good...
29/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: Lol
29/07/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: They were as infected described... "Noodles"
29/07/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: One even had a noodley appendage lmao
29/07/17, 01:12 - Infected: Heh.
29/07/17, 01:14 - Infected: I used to be fit but I let myself go after having my kid.
29/07/17, 01:14 - Tahnacious: I have always been fit but I never really looked it :(
29/07/17, 01:14 - Tahnacious: Like I have a bicep and a toned belly
29/07/17, 01:14 - Tahnacious: But other than that... Nope
29/07/17, 01:14 - Lulu: I aim to put up a good fight with most guys in an arm.wrestle
29/07/17, 01:14 - Tahnacious: Chunky calves if you count that :(
29/07/17, 01:15 - Infected: Same. I still had a squishy belly when I was healthy.
29/07/17, 01:15 - Lulu: 🤷🏻‍♀
29/07/17, 01:16 - Infected: Now I'm all squish. Lulz
29/07/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: #firstworldproblems

29/07/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: My butt is squish
29/07/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: Like black bootay level squish
29/07/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: But it is sore from all the workouts :(
29/07/17, 01:16 - Infected: I think men like that thougn
29/07/17, 01:16 - Infected: Though*
29/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: Perhaps but I'd rather it didn't move when I run
29/07/17, 01:17 - Lulu: But does that really matter
29/07/17, 01:17 - Lulu: Yeah
29/07/17, 01:17 - Lulu: Hmm
29/07/17, 01:17 - Lulu: Maybe you can focus on less lower body intense workouts to let the muscle heal a bit
29/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: If I ever learned to twerk may the gods be with ye
29/07/17, 01:17 - Lulu: So it's not always sore
29/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: There shall be earthquakes lol
29/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: XD
29/07/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: Alright, I'll try that
29/07/17, 01:18 - Infected: My mother watches those tutorials on YouTube.
29/07/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: Yeah I have no inspiration to do so
29/07/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: I really have no clue how to "move in a sexy way"
29/07/17, 01:19 - Lulu: Eh doesn't matter
29/07/17, 01:19 - Lulu: I don't even rly think twerking is sexy
29/07/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: That's why I put it in commas haha
29/07/17, 01:19 - Lulu: Ur literally just shaking ur butt
29/07/17, 01:20 - Lulu: Lol
29/07/17, 01:20 - Infected: I don't enjoy dancing.
29/07/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: Its the mating dance of the fatsss bimbo
29/07/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: *ass
29/07/17, 01:20 - Lulu: The ssss made me think of a snake
29/07/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: Hisssss
29/07/17, 01:21 - Infected: Especially in social instances. Loud bars and clubs give me me a migraine. People trolling around for someone to make out with in a dark corner. Eh, not my thing.
29/07/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: 🐍
29/07/17, 01:21 - Lulu: I've never done it but I think it'd depend on my mood
29/07/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: I've gone to clubs and such, never hooked up. Been approached plenty but never interested...
29/07/17, 01:21 - Infected: I do enjoy concerts on occasion.
29/07/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: I'm seeing AFI in September :)
29/07/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: I bought 2 tickets "just in case"
29/07/17, 01:22 - Lulu: I think I'd end up being that one at the bad ordering nonalcoholic drinks watching everyone be a drunk mess and laughing
29/07/17, 01:22 - Lulu: Bar
29/07/17, 01:22 - Lulu: Heh
29/07/17, 01:23 - Lulu: I don't like alcohol nor would I want to put myself in a vulnerable state
29/07/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: I never order drinks when out
29/07/17, 01:23 - Infected: I "used" to be an alcoholic. After a certain amount of time, the whole atmosphere that went along with it lost its appeal.
29/07/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: I either get sloshed beforehand or someone else thinks its a great idea to get me drunk
29/07/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: I don't drink often, so I'm a lightweight. 2 drinks does the trick
29/07/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: I still maintain rational thought throughout drunkenness :)
29/07/17, 01:25 - Lulu: Unless it has like a 2% alcohol content and is really fruity I'm not about it lol
29/07/17, 01:25 - Infected: I used to get black out drunk lol it wasn't pleasant. I'm not sure now why I used to enjoy those types of pursuits. Inner unhappiness, I suppose.
29/07/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: Haha moonshine is where its at!!
29/07/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: I've never been black out drunk.
29/07/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: Maybe I should go out tonight...
29/07/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: Sigh
29/07/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: Nope, I never meet anyone attractive while out anyways.
29/07/17, 01:26 - Infected: Maybe you should, if you like going out.
29/07/17, 01:26 - Lulu: Maybe try a new club
29/07/17, 01:27 - Lulu: Idk man
29/07/17, 01:27 - Infected: I'm about to listen to audible maybe play tetris.
29/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Eh, life sucks and I don't have much option where I live
29/07/17, 01:27 - Lulu: Do you play Tetris friends
29/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: I enjoy tetris
29/07/17, 01:27 - Infected: I've never heard of it. I play it on my gameboy
29/07/17, 01:27 - Lulu: There is this Tetris friends website
29/07/17, 01:27 - Lulu: U can play with and against others
29/07/17, 01:28 - Infected: That sounds fun.
29/07/17, 01:28 - Lulu: It's competitive and has items and stuff
29/07/17, 01:28 - Lulu: It's pretty addictive
29/07/17, 01:28 - Lulu: A lot about speed and accuracy
29/07/17, 01:29 - Infected: I tried to get into candy crush and I just couldn't.
29/07/17, 01:29 - Infected: It's not the same.

29/07/17, 03:46 - Tahnacious: I don't, but it might be one of the ones on YouTube. I saw one that was about 30 mins long that might be it.
29/07/17, 05:42 - Amin: Protect your self
29/07/17, 05:42 - Amin: U should go out with girls then, u dont need men

29/07/17, 14:16 - Tel: Ppl didn't know about it in India?
29/07/17, 14:16 - Tel: I would have thought that would be one of the countries that would have?
29/07/17, 14:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They do now but most didn't before
29/07/17, 14:16 - Tel: Interesting
29/07/17, 14:16 - Amin: I didnt wrestle with my exes 😅 at least not out of bed
29/07/17, 14:16 - Didier: What is haram?
29/07/17, 14:17 - Tel: Haram is opposite to halal
29/07/17, 14:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sin
29/07/17, 14:17 - Tel: Halal is similar to kosher in Judaism

29/07/17, 14:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep I do know
29/07/17, 14:18 - Amin: Taboo
29/07/17, 14:18 - Tel: Is that under sharia law?
29/07/17, 14:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Triple talaq is saying talaq thrice and that validates the divorce
29/07/17, 14:18 - Amin: 😂😂😂 halal means permited by islam

29/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sins aren't restrained, are you kidding me?
29/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: I said restrained by islam
29/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: Less harsh
29/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Basically haram is what Muslims call sin
29/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: Maybe what he means is that
29/07/17, 14:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haram is less restrained if anything
29/07/17, 14:24 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: Aaah
29/07/17, 14:24 - Didier: It's not forbidden by people?
29/07/17, 14:24 - Amin: Did I say s.th dif?
29/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haram only affects Muslims. The world is bigger than that. Sin affects all
29/07/17, 14:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If it even exists
29/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: Like,if u drink and it's considered a sin,people most likely won't care
29/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: Yeah haram is very serious
29/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: But if it's haram,people will care
29/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: For example
29/07/17, 14:25 - Amin: Alot of sex is haram
29/07/17, 14:25 - Didier: Their logic is flawed though,sigh
29/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: There are bigger sins and smaller sins. There are bigger harams and harams that shouldn't be harams in the first place
29/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: I mean with diffrent people
29/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: Not your wife
29/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Taboo is taboo.  Big or small, same goes for sin
29/07/17, 14:26 - Amin: What does taboo mean?
29/07/17, 14:26 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: All other measurement is for consolation
29/07/17, 14:27 - Tel: Hm. Sin doesn't affect all surely.. What about atheists? 

I just simply classify haram as sin in the same way that Allah is synonymous with God
29/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: For example,gays are considered a taboo
29/07/17, 14:27 - Didier: or were
29/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Notice what I said after it. "If it even exists". And by everyone I generalised it. There's always exceptions
29/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: Gay is haram too
29/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm am atheist myself
29/07/17, 14:27 - Amin: Tell me another taboo
29/07/17, 14:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Having sex before marriage?
29/07/17, 14:27 - Tel: Ah sorry, missed that
29/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Isn't that a haram too?
29/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: I am muslim , one of me is more strict
29/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: Something that's considered socially/culturally unacceptable. Like incest, or making out with your car
29/07/17, 14:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But does anyone bat an eye to premarital sex? It's like drinking. Which @6582280971 said. Harams aren't any bigger than sins imo
29/07/17, 14:28 - Amin: Aah
29/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: Ok taboo and haram are dif
29/07/17, 14:29 - ‪+27 81 571 9378‬: I personally think this is forbidden to avoid complications like babies or being a hoe
29/07/17, 14:29 - Amin: Haram is restrained strictly by islam
29/07/17, 14:29 - Didier: Car 😂
29/07/17, 14:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whatever the reason is man. But see the implications

29/07/17, 16:00 - Amin: 👋👋
29/07/17, 16:33 - Infected: Multiple personalities isn't really a thing. There are several personality disorders that include a "fractured personality", however.
29/07/17, 16:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It is most certainly a thing
29/07/17, 16:35 - Infected: Hold on, let me find my source.
29/07/17, 16:36 - Didier: It used to be called Multiple Personality Disorder.It's called Dissociative Identity Disorder now.
29/07/17, 16:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Basically the same thing
29/07/17, 16:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sure
29/07/17, 16:36 - Didier: Yeah
29/07/17, 16:45 - Infected: Well, here's two of the articles. They're quite old though. I read up on mpd when I was studying my own diagnosis. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201401/multiple-personality-mental-disorder-myth-or-metaphor%3famp
29/07/17, 16:45 - Infected: http://www.mdedge.com/currentpsychiatry/article/63686/dissociative-identity-disorder-time-remove-it-dsm-v
29/07/17, 16:46 - Infected: I'm interested in fractured personality studies.
29/07/17, 16:51 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I highly disagree with the writer of the first article
29/07/17, 16:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: "In every single instance, I discovered that the alternate personalities had been born under the tutelage of an enthusiastic and naive therapist, or in imitation of a friend, or after seeing a movie, or upon joining a multiples' chat group—or some combination."

Really cooked up
29/07/17, 16:54 - Infected: His article is highly opinionated, I agree.
29/07/17, 16:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I have a friend who's done nothing in life. Just fucked around failing at relationships, flunking tests and shit. He started to lie about being an international swimming champion, and believed it to the point where he actually derived pride from that outrageous assumption and hypocrisy.
29/07/17, 16:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He didn't really have any singled out factor. According to the writer, that's impossible
29/07/17, 16:55 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But I've seen it
29/07/17, 16:57 - Infected: The instance you described doesn't really sound like multiple personalities either. From my understanding, each personality is separate with its own catalogue of defined traits. Correct me if I'm wrong here, though. DID is not something I have studied in its entirety.
29/07/17, 16:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're right but he does have two instinct personalities
29/07/17, 16:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: He shifts identities like some kinda freak
29/07/17, 16:59 - Infected: That's very interesting tbh
29/07/17, 16:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Behaves differently when he's living in the real world
29/07/17, 16:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And other times like he's the alpha
29/07/17, 17:00 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I agree with first article
29/07/17, 17:00 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I think MPD is bullshit
29/07/17, 17:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Funny you do despite such a coherent example
29/07/17, 17:01 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: If we put it on mbti term, its just undeveloped cognitive fucntion
29/07/17, 17:01 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think what the writer is trying to say is that MPD is overdiagnosed and not entirely inexistent
29/07/17, 17:01 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Like you feel anxiety cause you have low Fe
29/07/17, 17:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well at least it's the only thing that makes sense to me
29/07/17, 17:03 - Infected: I highly doubt every single case is fraudulent but I also think that it doesn't occur as often as it is purported to.
29/07/17, 17:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly. So maybe saying it's overdiagnosed is more apt than saying it isn't really a thing
29/07/17, 17:05 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Yes, i mean that
29/07/17, 17:06 - Infected: You're correct. I should have said that to begin with.
29/07/17, 17:06 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Its kinda annoy me when many people claim that they have MPD just because they have conflicted feeling regarding something
29/07/17, 17:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: 😄
29/07/17, 17:07 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well it is annoying. I think those people don't even really understand MPD in the first place
29/07/17, 17:08 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Maybe they're just trying to attract concern
29/07/17, 17:08 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Or just want to be edgy special snowflake
29/07/17, 17:08 - Infected: It bothers me for personal reasons. I have a fractured personality disorder- BPD. It bothers me when people casually claim to be bipolar or have multiple personalities because it takes away from the seriousness of mental illness and takes away from studying and helping the conditions.
29/07/17, 17:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I get what you feel, for some reason
29/07/17, 17:09 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Do you have any mental/personality disorder?
29/07/17, 17:10 - Infected: The trivialization of mental illness is a set back to mental health awareness
29/07/17, 17:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not diagnosed at least. My parents don't really think mental issues are much of a common reality
29/07/17, 17:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: So haven't been to psychiatrists
29/07/17, 17:10 - Infected: Borderline personality disorder, according to the state.
29/07/17, 17:11 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Is that even real?
29/07/17, 17:11 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Suddenly i see so many people have anxiety or some shit
29/07/17, 17:11 - Infected: It's over diagnosed, imo
29/07/17, 17:11 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Why is it a trend now?
29/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Anxiety is surprisingly common among introverts
29/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The grunge culture is to blame for that
29/07/17, 17:12 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: No wonder i see it mostly on internet
29/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Grunge culture?
29/07/17, 17:13 - Infected: It's not just one thing that led to the commonality of having some type of mental issue.
29/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Agreed. But I know not of other factors
29/07/17, 17:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: That's the only example I could've thought of
29/07/17, 17:15 - Infected: From my reading on the subject of mental illness / anxiety, etc. I have noticed a trend that many people in high pressure/ menial jobs seek pharmaceutical help in coping with the pressures/ misery of their environment.
29/07/17, 17:16 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't understand why people with menial jobs would have to do that. To tackle self-worth issues?
29/07/17, 17:17 - Infected: It's not necessarily that everyone has anxiety to an extreme degree but taking a pill to cope is easier than finding internal coping strategies.
29/07/17, 17:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Exactly. Everyone wants the easier way out. But it leaves them screwed up
29/07/17, 17:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I learnt that the hard way
29/07/17, 17:18 - Infected: I think self worth has something to do with it but we also live in a time of instant gratification.
29/07/17, 17:18 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: True
29/07/17, 17:18 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Ugh
29/07/17, 17:19 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: So true that hurts
29/07/17, 17:19 - Tahnacious: I have a friend who has multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia, though he doesn't usually let people know. He's an ENTP.
29/07/17, 17:20 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: How can you say he have multiple personalities? Have you met them?
29/07/17, 17:20 - Infected: I can understand not wanting to let people know.
29/07/17, 17:21 - Tahnacious: Yeah, he even told me their names. One's even a female hah
29/07/17, 17:21 - Tahnacious: He told me because he knew I am chill and just accept everything about a person.
29/07/17, 17:21 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Is any of them different?
29/07/17, 17:22 - Tahnacious: Yeah, very.
29/07/17, 17:22 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Care to elaborate?
29/07/17, 17:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Ofc. Male-female
29/07/17, 17:22 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Dont tell me he's have his genital changes too
29/07/17, 17:23 - Tahnacious: Well it is almost as if theyre cognitive functions grouped together
29/07/17, 17:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Are genitals all that can be considered as a factor for personality shift?
29/07/17, 17:23 - Tahnacious: No, but when he's in one personality he believes he's female.
29/07/17, 17:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's not even concerning physicality
29/07/17, 17:23 - Tahnacious: He's normally jolly happy Ne type or person
29/07/17, 17:23 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I mean how can you tell his personality is a female?
29/07/17, 17:24 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: From his gesture?
29/07/17, 17:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The name
29/07/17, 17:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: She said he takes names
29/07/17, 17:24 - Infected: That's burgeoning into the realm of "trans is a personality disorder, not a distinct trait"
29/07/17, 17:24 - Tahnacious: Occasionally he's a bit of an smouldering negative Ti + Fe type of person, answers backed by anger
29/07/17, 17:24 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Oh boy
29/07/17, 17:25 - Tahnacious: But yeah then he has this female side which is flirty and obviously effeminate and he calls himself a girls name when he's like this, forget the name though
29/07/17, 17:25 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Maybe he's just a sissy
29/07/17, 17:26 - Tahnacious: And he keeps telling me he's torn between his sides and wants to know who he is
29/07/17, 17:26 - Tahnacious: And whether he would be happier getting a sex change if the female version of himself is the real him
29/07/17, 17:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Anyone watched split?
29/07/17, 17:26 - Infected: Never heard of it.
29/07/17, 17:27 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Maybe he just want to be trans
29/07/17, 17:27 - Tahnacious: When he's angry he's anything but.
29/07/17, 17:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's a psychological thriller movie with the protagonist having multiple personalities
29/07/17, 17:27 - FABIO: Yes. Awesome movie
29/07/17, 17:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Definitely
29/07/17, 17:28 - Tahnacious: No
29/07/17, 17:28 - Infected: There's a few movies out with characters that have multiple personalities.
29/07/17, 17:29 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Fight club
29/07/17, 17:30 - Tahnacious: A good one
29/07/17, 17:30 - Infected: I believe there's a Stephen King or maybe Dean Koontz book as well. 🤔
29/07/17, 17:30 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I only read the book btw
29/07/17, 17:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Cons are often MPDed
29/07/17, 17:34 - Arne: I had seen some reclame about this movie.. That guy has so damn much personalities, and one is worse than the other
29/07/17, 17:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah lol it keeps spiralling
29/07/17, 17:35 - Infected: I think I'll watch it after I catch up on Strain.
29/07/17, 17:36 - Arne: I won't go and see that movie. I never went over my fear of the dark, and some other things.
29/07/17, 17:37 - Arne: But it's fucked up  bc I like darkness
29/07/17, 17:37 - Infected: I rarely go to movie theaters, mostly because of the crowds. I rent on amazon.
29/07/17, 17:38 - Infected: You're afraid of the dark but you like darkness?
29/07/17, 17:38 - Tahnacious: I rarely go to the movie theaters because I have no one to go with, besides I've seen enough movies solo in a cinema for my lifetime
29/07/17, 17:38 - Arne: Yes.
29/07/17, 17:39 - Infected: That doesn't make sense to me. Explain?
29/07/17, 17:40 - Infected: I take my son to see movies. I don't really like going, myself. Although, there are a few movies I'll go to during the day when it's basically deserted.
29/07/17, 17:42 - Tahnacious: I went to see a movie with my guinea pig before... Lol
29/07/17, 17:42 - Infected: Aww lol
29/07/17, 17:42 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Litreal guinea pig?
29/07/17, 17:42 - Arne: I like the darkness, as in it has something eye catching. 
But on the other hand. When I'm alone, or something, I easily get aware of stuff, and I search everywhere for danger. And my eyesight is less than, got sensitive ears, and have seen some movies which let my fantasy go along...
29/07/17, 17:42 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: *literal
29/07/17, 17:43 - Tahnacious: Yes, it was the movie G force
29/07/17, 17:43 - Arne: Ooh G force
29/07/17, 17:43 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Oh, i thought you have slave or something
29/07/17, 17:43 - Tahnacious: I wish, lol
29/07/17, 17:44 - Arne: We have that movie at home, have seen that movie 4 times or so. When I was young
29/07/17, 17:45 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I was a teen when it came out. Thought it would be cute for my guinea pig to see a movie about guinea pigs.
29/07/17, 17:45 - Arne: 🤣🤣
29/07/17, 17:45 - Tahnacious: I think she enjoyed it, she didn't go to the bathroom or make a noise the whole time.
29/07/17, 17:45 - Arne: And did he like it?
29/07/17, 17:46 - Arne: Haha
29/07/17, 17:46 - Arne: She*
29/07/17, 17:46 - Tahnacious: All good :)
29/07/17, 17:46 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I've been go to movie once
Bad experiences
29/07/17, 17:46 - Tahnacious: I've always wanted to go there on a date that ends with none of the movie actually being seen
29/07/17, 17:47 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I can't pause when I go to toilet
Some people too noisy
I got seat in uncomfortable position
I need to pay extra for foods
29/07/17, 17:47 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Why do people even go to movies?
29/07/17, 17:48 - Arne: The experience with friends.
29/07/17, 17:48 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Why not watch it at our home instead
29/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: I always bought food from outside the cinema and smuggled it in.
29/07/17, 17:48 - Arne: Considering cool, and a movie you can see at first in a cinema. A few months later you can buy them for home
29/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: Because its the first release and some people really wan to see the movie today rather than wait
29/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: *want
29/07/17, 17:49 - Arne: Haha, I did once with friends... It was genius how it went "wrong"
29/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: I smuggled big burger king meals for everyone in once.
29/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: Never had an incident with food smuggling. If in doubt hide it in your chest, lol
29/07/17, 17:50 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Well thats a good point
29/07/17, 17:50 - Arne: We had put candies and stuff under our clothes, one of my friends dropped it in front of the desk. There was no one else there.
29/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: Oooops, awkward
29/07/17, 17:51 - Arne: Yes, I thought they had seen it, but they didn't react. 🤣🤣
29/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: Things don't fall out of my bra so for small objects it is perfect.
29/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
29/07/17, 17:51 - Arne: 👀 "small objects" 🤣
29/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: Lmao
29/07/17, 17:52 - Tahnacious: I mean anything smaller than your hand is concealed
29/07/17, 17:52 - Tahnacious: Wait that came out wrong
29/07/17, 17:52 - Tahnacious: Never mind, I'll stop
29/07/17, 17:52 - Arne: Yeah ok
29/07/17, 17:52 - Arne: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/07/17, 17:53 - Infected: I do that.
29/07/17, 17:55 - Infected: I always take a backpack or big purse and smuggle in meat snacks and candy. I smuggled in an entire chicken dinner for a friend once.
29/07/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: I've always been wary of people checking backpacks... And sometimes my backpack gets full so I end up placing stuff elsewhere
29/07/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 17:58 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I relate to this very much
29/07/17, 17:58 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 17:58 - Tahnacious: What about that one? Lol
29/07/17, 17:58 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Basically what should i do with friends?
29/07/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Gotta catch 'em all
29/07/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Collect them, store them in a PC somewhere and forget about them.
29/07/17, 17:59 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: 1 and 3 is no
But i swear to god I've got to 5 before
29/07/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Create a party with your favourites and train them to be useful
29/07/17, 17:59 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I save them on fb
29/07/17, 18:00 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: But seriously, what emotional support they expect?
29/07/17, 18:01 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I mean it's troublesome but I personally like them
29/07/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: "There there" is the default response, I think
29/07/17, 18:01 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Ugh, why my Fe isnt work on this?
29/07/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: "My dad died"

"That sucks... There there"
29/07/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: *pats friend's head*
29/07/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: Yes, I suck :|
29/07/17, 18:02 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Oh boy
29/07/17, 18:02 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I was thinking about that
29/07/17, 18:03 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Why you sad? People eventually die. Its about time. It's either you or them
29/07/17, 18:03 - Infected: Most of the people I interact with are intp.
29/07/17, 18:03 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Are they fun?
29/07/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: Yeah that's awkward because a lot of people don't think that way
29/07/17, 18:04 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I think i dont have irl into friends
29/07/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: I don't have IRL intp friends :(
29/07/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: I dated an intp though, once.
29/07/17, 18:04 - Infected: More fun than overly emotional people that I don't quite understand how to interact with.
29/07/17, 18:05 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I like talking with you guys
No drama
No one offended
We're talking about ideas instead of people
29/07/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it is my safe space
29/07/17, 18:06 - Infected: I have one irl friend. I think she's enfp. We don't get along sometimes. She says I don't know how to talk to people.
29/07/17, 18:06 - Tahnacious: My ex enfp was too overwhelming for me
29/07/17, 18:07 - Tahnacious: I can't stand unhealthy Te >_<
29/07/17, 18:07 - Tahnacious: Drives me so bonkers
29/07/17, 18:07 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: There there
29/07/17, 18:07 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Did i do it right?
29/07/17, 18:07 - Infected: She said she has to tell people that I don't mean to be an asshole before they meet me.
29/07/17, 18:08 - Tahnacious: Yes ^^
29/07/17, 18:09 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Alright, I think i got the idea now
29/07/17, 18:10 - Infected: What's the purpose of saying things just because that's what someone else expects you to do? It's not authentic, imo.
29/07/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: Fe is not authentic
29/07/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: Its harmonious
29/07/17, 18:10 - Arne: One of the things I might don't say things
29/07/17, 18:10 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: ^
29/07/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: I have zero Fi
29/07/17, 18:11 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: My Fi be like
"Why i make mistake like that? I'm a failure. I dont deserve to live anymore"
29/07/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: I dunno, I think that would be more subconscious Te
29/07/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: Failure to get things done etc
29/07/17, 18:13 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Not that, it like you being strict to yourself than other people
29/07/17, 18:13 - Infected: Mine is "I'm a charlatan and a fraud, I'm not intelligent or logical enough. I should hide under a rock" 

That's a constant inner diatribe.
29/07/17, 18:14 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: If people do same mistake you just like "i already expect you do that so no problem"
29/07/17, 18:14 - Infected: This ^
29/07/17, 18:15 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Thats why I shouldn't get a subordinate. Cause in the end I'll do it alone on my way
29/07/17, 18:19 - Tahnacious: Me too
29/07/17, 18:19 - Tahnacious: Other people tend to hand no clue what to do in a situation, so when I'm the first person to come up with answers they sit there with drool coming out their mouth.
29/07/17, 18:21 - Tahnacious: After a while it's like... well no one has anything to add to this so I guess I'm doing this alone unless anyone actually KNOWS how they can be of assistance...
29/07/17, 18:21 - Tahnacious: Group work sucks, it is like I'm talking to a bunch of bricks.
29/07/17, 18:22 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Just let an ENTJ do that
29/07/17, 18:22 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: The leadership thing
29/07/17, 18:26 - Tahnacious: There is never one around... So it's always me instead.
29/07/17, 18:26 - Tahnacious: Besides my subtype (if you believe/follow that) is E/J
29/07/17, 18:27 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: I'm usually surrounded by NFs...
29/07/17, 19:04 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 19:15 - Tahnacious: Omg yes please
29/07/17, 19:16 - Tahnacious: I know I live alone but sleeping in a bubble like that is amazing
29/07/17, 19:16 - Infected: Agreed

29/07/17, 20:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am back😁
29/07/17, 20:47 - Tahnacious: Welcome back
29/07/17, 20:48 - Tahnacious: I just took an instinctual variant test, apparently I'm sx/so
29/07/17, 20:48 - Tahnacious: I'm assuming for an intp that is just retarded :(
29/07/17, 20:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Tell me more about this....
29/07/17, 20:49 - Tahnacious: So aside from mbti there's ennegrams and instinctual variants...
29/07/17, 20:50 - Tahnacious: It all leads me to believe I'm a very fucked up excuse of an INTP
29/07/17, 20:50 - Tahnacious: My priorities are all over the shop and it is distressing :(
29/07/17, 20:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: You took the test right..
29/07/17, 20:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Send me the link
29/07/17, 20:51 - Tahnacious: Yup
29/07/17, 20:51 - Tel: Haven't heard of instinctual  variants..
29/07/17, 20:51 - Tahnacious: http://similarminds.com/variant.html
29/07/17, 20:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah me too. Maybe i will get it if I read about it
29/07/17, 20:52 - Tahnacious: There are three, social, sexual and self preservation.
29/07/17, 20:52 - Tahnacious: It doesn't take long to do the test, maybe 5 mins.
29/07/17, 20:53 - Tahnacious: "There is a metaphor that can further illustrate the strengths and experiences of the instinctual stackings. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll call it the bucket analogy.

The last instinct is like a bucket with a hole at the bottom. It can never get full enough. Most people will not bother much with that bucket, for they know it can never get full anyways. They see the bucket as inefficient and of lower value, so they preferably use other buckets.

The first instinct is akin to a bucket that also cannot ever get full enough. Not because there is a hole at the bottom, but because any liquid you put into it transforms into your favourite beverage, and you cannot get enough of it. You drink and drink, and are never fully satisfied. When someone else takes this bucket away from you, you experience serious withdrawal symptoms. You are addicted to the magnificent beverage it produces.

The second instinct is the bucket that is just right. It has no holes, nor does it transform the liquids into a beverage you cannot get enough of. In that way, it does its job just right. There are no illusions or deficiencies with that instinct, it can assess the reality of situations the most accurately. This bucket is not as precious as the one that makes all liquids taste wonderful, but if you grow to realize its use you will gain great benefits from it."
29/07/17, 21:00 - Tel: I don't get it. Need to look into it more perhaps
29/07/17, 21:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 21:02 - Tahnacious: I think the easiest way to explain the three is:

Sexual wants a close intense bond with one person, not necessarily sex defined, it can be a friend as well.

Social wants to be socially acceptable and please others.

Self preservation cares about self maintenance and not putting oneself in danger
29/07/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: You would be sx/sp then
29/07/17, 21:03 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Hey I don't want to be socially acceptable or be pleasing the crowd type person
29/07/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: Everyone's secondary is usually their point of calling. Focus on your health and you'll be more well rounded.
29/07/17, 21:04 - Tahnacious: Pretty much that's what the results say :P
29/07/17, 21:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Because if I become socially acceptable, it will just be minutes before I realize that something is wrong...
29/07/17, 21:04 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
29/07/17, 21:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And what you say for sexual.... Yeah I agree to it
29/07/17, 21:05 - Tel: Sexual|||||||||||||||46%
Social|||||||||||||||42%
Self Preservation||||||||||||38%
29/07/17, 21:05 - Tahnacious: It is all about having intense stuff happen
29/07/17, 21:05 - Tel: What does that mean?
29/07/17, 21:05 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I do want very close and intense bond with a person
29/07/17, 21:06 - Tahnacious: It means yours are probably too close to cast an accurate judgement but you'd be the same as me if we took the results in the order they came
29/07/17, 21:06 - Tel: I'm retarded too?!
29/07/17, 21:06 - Tel: :p
29/07/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: <3
29/07/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: "Sexual instinct can be called the instinct of attraction. It’s aggressive, competitive, single-minded, "all-or-nothing". Use of this energy is intensely fiery and affirmative, go-get-it approach, a life-and-death matter e.g. salmon swimming upstream to mate and die. With this instincts you are either turned on or you're not - it is what it is; you cannot fight mother nature. With this instinct one's attention is wholly captivated energetically by someone or something.

The SX energy is described as "high energy" and is often experienced as "intense", "assertive", "laser-like", "intently focused", "playful yet penetrating" in nature. The feeling of SX-first is sometimes compared to being on a roller-coaster ride even though you aren't on one. This subtype will "sacrifice for the relationship" to insure intensity connection. This intensity does not have to be met by another person—it can be satisfied by a project, hobby, or special interest. Rather than looking inward or to the group to resolve their problems and challenges, these types tend to look to close relations and activities that can guarantee them an experience of liveliness and intensity.

SX-first people enjoy feeling invigorated. They may fantasize about scenarios that make them feel alive and that are emotionally stimulating. Key words: activation, immersion, charisma, broadcasting displays, fusion, inspiration, volatility."
29/07/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: It seems we are all sx first.
29/07/17, 21:09 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ok that does happen
29/07/17, 21:09 - Tahnacious: I just thought it was weird because what it suggests seems to conflict with the usual INTP tropes
29/07/17, 21:09 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: 😅
29/07/17, 21:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, you don't need to be an INTP or be worried of not going with the guidelines for being an INTP
29/07/17, 21:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: There is nothing wierd
29/07/17, 21:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: It's just you
29/07/17, 21:10 - Tahnacious: I wear my weirdness with pride :P
29/07/17, 21:10 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: ditto
29/07/17, 21:12 - Tel: Hm, not so much. I enjoy being invigorated by ideas and whatnot.. And scenarios that are stimulating, etc etc. And I am pretty much an all or nothing person in relationships / projects
29/07/17, 21:12 - Tel: Kinda makes sense tbh
29/07/17, 21:12 - Tahnacious: Hah I can recall math class in high school
29/07/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: I was doing extension math, and I'd been going against the grain the whole time
29/07/17, 21:13 - Tel: INTPs are typically either extremely interested in something or not at all.. Least from my exp
29/07/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: I'd zone out in class, not hear anything the teacher said about calculus and then look at the page and try to figure out what was being asked of me without direction
29/07/17, 21:14 - Tahnacious: I ended up getting my answers right but "did not show my working"
29/07/17, 21:14 - Tel: Haha! Yup, been there plenty times. Even at work in meetings
29/07/17, 21:14 - Tahnacious: Which resulted in half my marks always going. I didn't know how to show my working since I didn't pay attention to the part where the teacher showed their method of solving the equation
29/07/17, 21:14 - Tel: Even when I've been the chair of the meeting :p
29/07/17, 21:15 - Tel: Haha! Clever, then, to have been able to do it
29/07/17, 21:15 - Tel: Re ^^
29/07/17, 21:15 - Tahnacious: And sometimes I've tried to show my working but my teachers couldn't understand it because it wasn't anything like what they showed in class and not in the same order
29/07/17, 21:15 - Tahnacious: Consequently I always did poorly in math. "Why don't you just drop down to regular math?" My teacher suggested...
29/07/17, 21:16 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Always me !! And i lose usually lost my marks for not showing the working. I easily calculate it mentally
29/07/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: NOPE! FUCK THAT! There was a final year 12 exam on my birthday. I dropped the entire subject.
29/07/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: 😁
29/07/17, 21:16 - Tel: Hahaha
29/07/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: Yeah, so relatable eh? XD
29/07/17, 21:17 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Same. I have my own methods of solving them:p
29/07/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: Just a big middle finger to my teacher. The principal was soooooo pissed at my teacher too
29/07/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: Difference was my principal had seen my IQ test results and figured out what was happening.
29/07/17, 21:18 - Tel: What happened in the end? Still dropped it?
29/07/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: Naturally ;) I left the school too.
29/07/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: A month before the end of year 12 exams finished.
29/07/17, 21:19 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: So you didn't study maths after that ?
29/07/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: Changed schools and yolo'd my way through. Did relatively poorly but fuck em
29/07/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: Nope
29/07/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: I only had that final exam to go anyway, no more classes.
29/07/17, 21:20 - Tahnacious: I admit I lost interest when the subject became all theory and nothing of practical use to me (unless I became an engineer)
29/07/17, 21:20 - Tahnacious: Which is weird for an intp, I know. But I had other subjects I enjoyed more.
29/07/17, 21:20 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: No its not
29/07/17, 21:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Sometimes science got on Newton's nerves
29/07/17, 21:21 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And sometimes I too don't feel like doing maths
29/07/17, 21:21 - Tahnacious: that's interesting
29/07/17, 21:22 - Tahnacious: I always doubted myself because I can never fit in the box
29/07/17, 21:22 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, but I don't have much problem with math's not being practical and being only of theory
29/07/17, 21:22 - Tel: Yea.. I know a feck load re mbti and have known about enneagrams for ages, and have been informed they're meant to be more accurate (I haven't seen evidence of this..), but I cba looking it up (yet I still look up more and more mbti stuff). I think we just are interested in some stuff and not in others
29/07/17, 21:22 - Tahnacious: I didn't mind it, loved trig
29/07/17, 21:23 - Tel: Maybe that's the nurture said of the INTP nature
29/07/17, 21:23 - Tahnacious: But once it got super super abstract I was like... Honestly...whyyyy?
29/07/17, 21:23 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Well, we are "out of the box":p
29/07/17, 21:23 - Tel: +1
29/07/17, 21:23 - Tahnacious: Fair enough hah
29/07/17, 21:23 - Tahnacious: Apparently I'm a 4w5
29/07/17, 21:24 - Tel: Hm, I can't even remember what mine was!
29/07/17, 21:24 - Tel: Haha!
29/07/17, 21:24 - Tahnacious: 4/9/5 tritype
29/07/17, 21:24 - Tahnacious: Yeah most intps are 5s
29/07/17, 21:25 - Tel: Makes sense
29/07/17, 21:25 - Tel: I'll have to do it again sometime
29/07/17, 21:25 - Tel: Maybe this week
29/07/17, 21:32 - Tel: Mine is 5/1, with 7 as third?
29/07/17, 21:33 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 21:33 - Tahnacious: They have a number adjacent as your secondary
29/07/17, 21:33 - Tahnacious: And your tritype is any number between that
29/07/17, 21:33 - Tel: Oh, I don't get that bit then
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tel: That to do with the diagram?
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tahnacious: Can't tell if you're a 5w4 or a 5w6
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tahnacious: I think so
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tahnacious: It is possible to be just a 5
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tahnacious: Could equally be a 1w9
29/07/17, 21:34 - Tahnacious: Because it adds up the same
29/07/17, 21:35 - Tel: Oo
29/07/17, 21:35 - Tel: I wouldn't call myself a peaceful person.. :p
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tel: I like debates too much
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tel: Reformer yes.. Thinker yea
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tahnacious: Usually I debate both sides to get everyone to stfu
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tel: Yup. Devil's advocate is a nice role
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tahnacious: Amy you are right because of x and john you are right because of y, now everyone shut up
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tahnacious: Lol
29/07/17, 21:36 - Tel: I think 5w4 makes more sense to me
29/07/17, 21:37 - Tel: Haha Yup! That's a frequent occurrence
29/07/17, 21:37 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I'm a 4w5 which made me scared I was an INFP that didn't understand Fi
29/07/17, 21:37 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
29/07/17, 21:38 - Tel: Haha
29/07/17, 21:38 - Tahnacious: I then got facially typed with no info, just my face and they spat out intp
29/07/17, 21:38 - Tahnacious: So I'm like whelp I guess that settles it
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tel: Facially typed? Is that even a thing?
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tahnacious: Yeah, basic structure of face changes based on cognitive functions
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tel: What is it.. We look extra sceptical at the camera / person?
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tahnacious: The more your mind settles in to one frame the more the lines will crease in such way
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tel: Hm not far off then
29/07/17, 21:39 - Tel: :p
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: No, has to be default expression
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: Resting bitchface
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tel: Haha
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: In my cade I have resting niceface which is a suuuuper big problem for me
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tel: I thought I had a neutral face tbh.. Good poker face. Unless I play poker I guess
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: I'm always that one person people on the street ask for help
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: That one person all the kiddies swarm
29/07/17, 21:40 - Tahnacious: X_x
29/07/17, 21:41 - Tahnacious: My lips are naturally slightly upturned. When I zone out I look like I'm smiling
29/07/17, 21:42 - Tahnacious: People are always approaching me in public and it scares me :(
29/07/17, 21:43 - Tel: Well, that's a good thing at least - girls look much nicer smiley faces I find. Though you may find it annoying they keep coming to you.. Darn the non-existent God for giving you looks that don't match up with your personality type!!
29/07/17, 21:44 - Tahnacious: I know. I need glasses
29/07/17, 21:44 - Tahnacious: Would suit my Ti
29/07/17, 21:44 - Tahnacious: I have costume ones I could make use of...
29/07/17, 21:44 - Tel: I've learned to get used to ppl approaching and asking for help - I work in a hospital, so it goes with the territory. I even do it with a smile.. A totally conscious effort, of course
29/07/17, 21:44 - Tel: Haha! Yes, totally re Ti
29/07/17, 21:46 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 21:46 - Tahnacious: Hurrr durrrr
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tahnacious: Always conscious effort to use Fe....
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tel: Haha - how do you come by prop glasses so easily?
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tel: The only prop thing I have nearby is a pirates outfit.. And that's because I'm going to a music festival in a few weeks
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tahnacious: Because I am a cosplayer so I keep em handy
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tel: (no, I'm not Gna put it on and take a pic.. :D)
29/07/17, 21:47 - Tahnacious: <3 pirate
29/07/17, 21:48 - Tel: Cosplayer?
29/07/17, 21:48 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I get glasses from Japan
29/07/17, 21:48 - Tahnacious: It was parr of a new years goodie bag thing they have in their culture
29/07/17, 21:49 - Tahnacious: So I kept it as part of my secondary wardrobe
29/07/17, 21:49 - Tahnacious: *part
29/07/17, 21:49 - Tel: Sounds cool.. Just googled cosplayer. Never heard of it before
29/07/17, 21:50 - Tahnacious: Basically I dress as characters for funsies.
29/07/17, 21:50 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 21:50 - Tahnacious: That business...
29/07/17, 21:50 - Tel: That looks funky!
29/07/17, 21:51 - Tahnacious: And because I am Ti dominant I actually try to pull it off ACCURATELY rather than SKIMPILY
29/07/17, 21:51 - Tahnacious: ugh...
29/07/17, 21:51 - Tahnacious: That kind of crap pisses me off, honestly.
29/07/17, 21:51 - Tel: Haha, yea - all in or not at all
29/07/17, 21:51 - Tahnacious: Too many girls think if I put on one part of the costume and have my tits out that's good enough
29/07/17, 21:53 - Tel: Haha, no effort at all
29/07/17, 21:54 - Tel: Though I guess it satisfies their types - females largely being F types
29/07/17, 21:54 - Tahnacious: True
29/07/17, 21:54 - Tel: Might have something to do with it? Pure guess without thought
29/07/17, 21:54 - Tel: Well, a little thought
29/07/17, 21:54 - Tahnacious: I like the idea of the attention but I wouldn't adjust the costume to get it
29/07/17, 21:55 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I expect you're right
29/07/17, 21:57 - Tel: Am trying to think what I prioritised when pickin pirates outfit.. Think it was more cost + looking like Depp + I wanted a sword..
29/07/17, 21:57 - Tel: Not much thought other than that :D
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tahnacious: That's fine haha
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tahnacious: But to try and do something like
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tel: Cost - only Gna ruin it at muddy festivals. 
Depp - why not? 
Sword - way fun. But didn't come with it! Need to get it separately
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tahnacious: That's where I lose interest
29/07/17, 21:58 - Tel: Haha
29/07/17, 21:59 - Tahnacious: Or the male version ...
29/07/17, 21:59 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 22:00 - Tahnacious: I just facepalm and say "for fucks sake..."
29/07/17, 22:01 - Tel: Haha, yea, it's less about the outfit and more about themselves. Which is fair enough.. But they're more bedroom outfits :p
29/07/17, 22:03 - Tahnacious: I agree hah
29/07/17, 22:03 - Tahnacious: But people walk out in public like that
29/07/17, 22:03 - Tahnacious: I even cosplayed as an INFP before haha
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tel: How's that work?
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tel: As in, how do you cosplayer a diff type?
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tel: Cosplay *
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tahnacious: First, go for a whimsical look
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tel: Lol!
29/07/17, 22:04 - Tel: Yea, I got it as soon as you posted the pic
29/07/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: Then you look off in to the distance as if contemplating "feels"
29/07/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: Or dragons n shit
29/07/17, 22:05 - Tel: Lololol
29/07/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: So true though xD
29/07/17, 22:06 - Tel: Yea, your demeanour is different too. First pic you sent re prev outfit is much more thoughtful. This is much more dreamy
29/07/17, 22:06 - Tel: Well, yes - good cosplaying, then, as even I got it straight away!
29/07/17, 22:06 - Tahnacious: I can fake Fi well ^^
29/07/17, 22:06 - Tahnacious: Haha
29/07/17, 22:06 - Tel: Seemingly! Truly an expert you are
29/07/17, 22:07 - Tahnacious: Bahaahha
29/07/17, 22:07 - Tahnacious: Honestly I don't understand people at all but I can chameleon the shit out of most situations
29/07/17, 22:07 - Tel: Yea, I think that's an INTP thing
29/07/17, 22:07 - Tel: I defo do it a lot.
29/07/17, 22:07 - Tahnacious: Probably, I've heard it referenced a lot
29/07/17, 22:08 - Tel: I remember coming away from my uncle's place when I was a kid and I had picked up one of his quirky laughs..
29/07/17, 22:08 - Tel: It was such a good copy that others noticed it too. Lol
29/07/17, 22:08 - Tahnacious: Yeah ugh, apparently I subconscious pick up mannerisms like that
29/07/17, 22:08 - Tahnacious: *subconsciously
29/07/17, 22:08 - ‪+91 91768 00222‬: How do you differentiate between ESTP and ESTJ females early in a relationship?
29/07/17, 22:08 - Tahnacious: Ummm
29/07/17, 22:09 - Tel: ESTP = adrenaline junkie right?
29/07/17, 22:09 - Tel: And ESTJ.. I'd so, bossy?
29/07/17, 22:09 - Tel: Idano*
29/07/17, 22:09 - Tahnacious: Estjs are more likely to go out and get what they want
29/07/17, 22:09 - Tahnacious: Office types
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tahnacious: I'd need to know function stack, I suck.
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tel: ESTP = Se, Ti, Fe, Ni
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tahnacious: I can't remember SP and SJ since I don't know any
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tahnacious: Thank you
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tel: ESTJ = Te, Si, Ne, Fi
29/07/17, 22:10 - Tahnacious: So estp would be less clumsy than us for sure
29/07/17, 22:11 - Tahnacious: They're very much in the real world here and now
29/07/17, 22:11 - Tahnacious: Estj probably has better memory and is organised
29/07/17, 22:12 - Tahnacious: Estj probably handles jokes and abstract thought a little better
29/07/17, 22:12 - Tahnacious: But not significantly so
29/07/17, 22:12 - Tahnacious: Since estp shares Ti with us expect them to occasionally look away and contemplate
29/07/17, 22:13 - Tahnacious: Then return back to the real world and surroundings via Se
29/07/17, 22:13 - Tel: Great analysis
29/07/17, 22:14 - Tahnacious: That's the best I can come up with without actually looking it up through specifics.
29/07/17, 22:14 - Tel: I like the way you break it down. You've obv researched it a fair whack.. Guess most ppl in here have to be in an INTP group though
29/07/17, 22:14 - Tel: Well, from what I know, you're right
29/07/17, 22:14 - Tahnacious: I'd like to know people of these types though, eventually. Even if we don't get along, just to study them.
29/07/17, 22:14 - Tel: I'd say the biggest telltale sign is the gap between the dominant and inferior
29/07/17, 22:15 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm not too familiar with Ni
29/07/17, 22:15 - Tahnacious: I know Fi is about personal morals
29/07/17, 22:15 - Tel: Are they much more logical than emotional in tune, or is there a big difference between big pictures / fine detail
29/07/17, 22:15 - Tahnacious: Ni is like... Coming up with an idea out of the blue
29/07/17, 22:15 - Tahnacious: Not necessarily making a connection but just right because they know it within themselves
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tel: Yup, that's what my INFJ friend says
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tahnacious: Phew haha
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tel: Must be subconscious realisation or something
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tahnacious: Yeah, my mum does that
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tahnacious: I'm trying to type my mum
29/07/17, 22:16 - Tahnacious: Its so hard because I see everything
29/07/17, 22:17 - Tel: Older ppl have developed their inferior functions more
29/07/17, 22:17 - Tahnacious: True, she's 67
29/07/17, 22:18 - Tahnacious: I see unhealthy Te and unhealthy Fe and it doesn't make sense.
29/07/17, 22:18 - Tahnacious: I see Ni more than Ne...
29/07/17, 22:18 - Tel: Wow, you don't look old enough to have a mother in her 60s. Good genes!
29/07/17, 22:18 - Tahnacious: I'd definitely put her as an NT
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tahnacious: Haha she had my in her 40s :P
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tel: Ahhh, ok, that makes more sense
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tahnacious: ;) lol
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tel: Lol, sorry for the interjections of your analysis
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tahnacious: But I've been told I haven't really aged in the past 3-4 year so whatever
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tel: Interjection to*
29/07/17, 22:19 - Tahnacious: Its OK :)
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tahnacious: But maybe we can figure out both of my parents...
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tel: Well, that's a handy trait. I recently become about 10 years younger myself
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tahnacious: Care to join me?
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tahnacious: Hahah
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tel: (I had a haircut and a clean shave.. :p)
29/07/17, 22:20 - ‪+91 91768 00222‬: My new GF is slightly bossy. But then everyone bosses me. She is very well organised and hates mess. Sounds logical too. This points to ESTJ. 

But then she is very social too. And has little patience with long term planning.  Which points to ESTP.

I am confused. 

What is the one question that I can ask to differentiate
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tel: Yup, happy to help!
29/07/17, 22:20 - Tahnacious: Nice, clean shave is awesome haha
29/07/17, 22:21 - Tahnacious: I'd guess at estj personally
29/07/17, 22:21 - Tahnacious: Not all Js are great at planning
29/07/17, 22:21 - Tahnacious: And they're less likely to be patient
29/07/17, 22:21 - Tahnacious: In general
29/07/17, 22:22 - Tahnacious: Te is verrrry bossy haha
29/07/17, 22:22 - Tahnacious: Anyway.... So my mum has little tolerance for emotion and feelings
29/07/17, 22:22 - Tel: Harman.. Does she like sports / adrenaline rushes?
29/07/17, 22:23 - Tel: Very 'in the moment' type stuff?
29/07/17, 22:23 - Tel: That's a typical ESTP thing
29/07/17, 22:23 - Tel: Back to you T
29/07/17, 22:23 - Tel: Ps +1
29/07/17, 22:23 - Tahnacious: She's definitely brainy too, knows a lot about many things, but as a child when I asked "why" she was the first to respond with "because I told you so" which infuriated me
29/07/17, 22:24 - Tel: Oo I hated that too
29/07/17, 22:24 - Tahnacious: Whenever I cried she would send me to my room because she couldn't tolerate the noise
29/07/17, 22:24 - ‪+91 91768 00222‬: Doesn't seem much more than average.
29/07/17, 22:24 - Tahnacious: This always confused me because I thought mothers were supposed to ask what's wrong, give you a hug and make you feel better about yourself
29/07/17, 22:26 - Tahnacious: She's also incredibly bossy, she always orders my dad around and is very controlling, if someone deviates from her plan she just explodes with anger
29/07/17, 22:26 - Tahnacious: She's also relatively lazy, she doesn't cook and rarely cleans, she makes dad do it. She's good with money though and spends time paying bills and answering phonecalls before retreating to the TV to watch Dr Phil and eat cake
29/07/17, 22:27 - Tahnacious: My relationship with my mother was always very jaded as a teenager
29/07/17, 22:27 - Tahnacious: I know she cares about me and my wellbeing but she doesn't show it at all.
29/07/17, 22:28 - Tahnacious: She haaaates being interrupted while reading or listening to tv
29/07/17, 22:28 - Tel: Doesn't like changes to plans then?
29/07/17, 22:28 - Tahnacious: She actually adapts well to inhuman circumstances, its just when she told someone to do x and they did y it is game over
29/07/17, 22:29 - Tahnacious: But if there's a fire or something broke etc it's fine
29/07/17, 22:29 - Tel: What you're talking about is hinting at Te/Fi
29/07/17, 22:29 - Tahnacious: Yeah she is rather self absorbed I would say
29/07/17, 22:29 - Tel: And if exploding in anger, etc, it's probably in that order, too
29/07/17, 22:29 - Tahnacious: But not openly expressing it
29/07/17, 22:30 - Tahnacious: Yeah she's always yelling and asking people why they didn't do this the way she said
29/07/17, 22:30 - Tahnacious: And as mentioned earlier she often just pulls up info from instinctively knowing it
29/07/17, 22:30 - Tahnacious: For example she told me intelligence is inherited from the mothers genes
29/07/17, 22:31 - Tel: Hm, looking at the past and reflecting on that is more generally an S and train
29/07/17, 22:31 - Tel: S trait*
29/07/17, 22:31 - Tahnacious: Years later I recalled that info and saw a study on it and shared it with her
29/07/17, 22:31 - Tahnacious: She used to do acting and modelling when she was younger
29/07/17, 22:31 - Tahnacious: She doesn't have many friends and sometimes feels fake when she's smiling to greet people
29/07/17, 22:32 - Tahnacious: If anything even more fake than I am!
29/07/17, 22:32 - Tahnacious: She hardly ever leaves the house but she's depressed too.
29/07/17, 22:32 - Tahnacious: I think she's developing agoraphobia
29/07/17, 22:33 - Tel: Hm. Have you ever discussed mbti theory with her? Or other theories, concepts, abstract 'stuff'?
29/07/17, 22:33 - Tahnacious: I discussed it briefly, she's not the sort of person to have time for talking though.
29/07/17, 22:33 - Tahnacious: I also discussed it when I didn't know it as much as I do now
29/07/17, 22:33 - Tahnacious: She said she identifies with thinker traits at least
29/07/17, 22:34 - Tel: Hm, agoraphobia is a fear of certain events (I can't remember the specific), meaning you take steps to avoid them - ie going outside.. Which is why it's seen as a fear of the outside. Key there is to understand what the underlying thing is. If depressed, maybe simpler to say it's that rather hand also agoraphobia? Idano - not a clinician
29/07/17, 22:34 - Tahnacious: Most people who know her don't really like her that much hah
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm not sure, she just makes everyone else do the things that involve leaving the house
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tahnacious: She also hoards things
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tahnacious: A LOT
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tel: Prob an S trait
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tahnacious: she currently has 80 dogs and 80 horses and forces my dad to keep up
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tahnacious: Its probably the Achilles heel of the whole thing
29/07/17, 22:35 - Tel: Huh? 80 live dogs and 80 live horses?
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: She loves animals but she hordes the fuck out of them
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: Yes indeed
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tel: Wow
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: I don't go near their house because I fear them
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: They're unsocial, they bite
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tel: Hm, don't know how to read that part tbh
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: She's great with their paperwork though so any time inspectors from RSPCA come she just shows she's got it all under control and they leave her alone
29/07/17, 22:36 - Tahnacious: Yeah it is purely selfish
29/07/17, 22:37 - Tahnacious: She keeps too many animals because she likes them more than people and then she makes dad stay up till 4am feeding them
29/07/17, 22:37 - Tahnacious: My dad is a very compliant person so we will get to him shortly
29/07/17, 22:38 - Tahnacious: It is very very hard to read
29/07/17, 22:38 - Tahnacious: As I said, she's an unhealthy person and all over the shop
29/07/17, 22:38 - Tahnacious: I'm hoping if I knew her type I'd be able to help her or communicate better with her
29/07/17, 22:38 - Tel: If Te/Fi, she would be a J. This means her dominant perceiving function is introverted. Also, SJ and NP are most common partners..
29/07/17, 22:39 - Tahnacious: I think my dad could be an intp, he definitely shows Ti
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tel: Well, if Si you'd think she'd be better at looking after self?
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tahnacious: Hah yeah, I would say so too
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tahnacious: Her memory is also not that great
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tahnacious: Its ok
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tahnacious: She accuses dad of having bad memory but hers is worse.
29/07/17, 22:40 - Tel: Does she focus more on past /present or future?
29/07/17, 22:41 - Tahnacious: She seems present and future orientated
29/07/17, 22:41 - Tahnacious: It is hard to have conversations about the past
29/07/17, 22:41 - Tel: Hm, past / present is typically S, N is future
29/07/17, 22:41 - Tahnacious: She doesn't animate when talking about the past like my dad does
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tel: Theoretical discussions, abstract etc, is also N
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tahnacious: Yeah she's not too abstract
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tahnacious: But she does pull out reasoning from thin air
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tel: I have my mbti cards downstairs - I'll have to take pics and send them to you later
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tahnacious: Haha ok
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tahnacious: As I say, a very difficult case.
29/07/17, 22:42 - Tel: Hm, is she good at making links between things? Seeing patterns?
29/07/17, 22:43 - Tahnacious: I can't even tell if she's introverted or extraverted because she has wide open eyes and gestures a lot, a very animated and enthusiastic person when talking to people. She practically uses her whole body
29/07/17, 22:43 - Tahnacious: But at the same time she seems to deeply appreciate her privacy
29/07/17, 22:43 - Tel: Talking about what = animated?
29/07/17, 22:43 - Tahnacious: Yeah she's good at seeing patterns
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: Like something bad that happened
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: She over dramatises
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: And exaggerates
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: One dog got loose...
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: Then EEEEEVERYTHING went wrong *gestures wildly*
29/07/17, 22:44 - Tahnacious: And you dad, hah, he was sitting in his shed, he did nothing at all, can you believe it?!
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tahnacious: *your
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tahnacious: That is typical of her
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tel: Lol
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tel: Hm
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tel: Yea, difficult! Haha
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tahnacious: She did do acting though
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tahnacious: So I dunno if it is a manifestation of that
29/07/17, 22:45 - Tahnacious: Or the acting cane as a manifestation of her type
29/07/17, 22:46 - Tahnacious: *came
29/07/17, 22:46 - Tel: Hm true
29/07/17, 22:46 - Tahnacious: I'm sure she's a thinker rather than a feeler but I can't accurately judge the rest.
29/07/17, 22:46 - Tahnacious: I think the S/N are close they would have to be auxiliary and tertiary
29/07/17, 22:47 - Tel: If Te, and you think SN are close, then she's E
29/07/17, 22:47 - Tahnacious: Yeah
29/07/17, 22:47 - Tel: ESTJ or ENTJ
29/07/17, 22:47 - Tahnacious: That would be my guess
29/07/17, 22:48 - Tahnacious: Hard to say which because when in the right state of mind she can tell a really funny story
29/07/17, 22:49 - Tel: In that case, it wouldn't make a massive difference between SN as they're not too far apart
29/07/17, 22:49 - Tahnacious: Yeah its just whether it is si/ne or ni/se
29/07/17, 22:49 - Tel: Si, under stress, can be OCD like I think
29/07/17, 22:50 - Tahnacious: She's not a risk taker
29/07/17, 22:50 - Tel: But unsure if that's just for inferior function
29/07/17, 22:50 - Tahnacious: I know si inferiors they buy stuff and eat stuff when under stress
29/07/17, 22:50 - Tahnacious: Ugh its annoying haha
29/07/17, 22:51 - Tahnacious: My mum doesn't spend money flippantly, she's fairly good at saving
29/07/17, 22:51 - Tel: My INFJ friend told me that.. I don't get it though. Can see that I do some things that look ocd like, but there's no rationale behind doing them - just sensory habitual?
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tel: Hm, I'd lean slightly towards N based on what you've said.. Plus, you said you learnt towards N earlier too.
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tel: Lean*
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tahnacious: Her desk also looks very disorganised
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tahnacious: Papers everywhere in an order only she can understand
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tahnacious: Yeah
29/07/17, 22:52 - Tahnacious: Best guess anyway
29/07/17, 22:53 - Tel: Female ENTJs are meant to be quite butch, I was told
29/07/17, 22:53 - Tahnacious: I guess tertiary Se with inferior Fi would explain the obsession with having many pets...
29/07/17, 22:53 - Tel: Masculine
29/07/17, 22:53 - Tahnacious: She is haha
29/07/17, 22:54 - Tahnacious: She tries to be feminine and places a deliberate emphasis on it (think umbridge from harry potter) but he's physical actions are anything but
29/07/17, 22:54 - Tahnacious: *her
29/07/17, 22:54 - Tahnacious: She's clumsy like me
29/07/17, 22:54 - Tahnacious: Not as clumsy but she is
29/07/17, 22:55 - Infected: Evening.
29/07/17, 22:55 - Tel: LOL re Umbridge - had to Google, but v funny
29/07/17, 22:55 - Tahnacious: Haha
29/07/17, 22:55 - Tahnacious: Yeah :P
29/07/17, 22:55 - Tel: Evening!
29/07/17, 22:55 - Tahnacious: Hi
29/07/17, 22:55 - Infected: Yes.
29/07/17, 22:55 - Infected: Hello, I mean.
29/07/17, 22:56 - Tahnacious: I'll guess she's entj then, I'll try and type my dad tomorrow. My circuits are fried.
29/07/17, 22:56 - Tel: Yup, I should hit the sack too
29/07/17, 22:56 - Tahnacious: All the best :)
29/07/17, 22:57 - Tel: Been fun! Thanks for explaining / sharing re cosplay plus enneagrams! Learned a couple of new things.
29/07/17, 22:57 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 22:57 - Tahnacious: I appear to have cut myself somehow....
29/07/17, 22:58 - Tahnacious: No worries, enjoy :)
29/07/17, 22:58 - Tahnacious: I had fun too
29/07/17, 22:58 - Tel: Ow, what a random cut.
29/07/17, 22:58 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 22:59 - Tel: Don't get infected! :)
29/07/17, 22:59 - Tel: N'nyt
29/07/17, 22:59 - Tahnacious: Yeah it is a little awkward and difficult
29/07/17, 23:01 - Infected: The way they worded their questions was odd. Some of the words were in the wrong place.

 What is the purpose of the test?
29/07/17, 23:09 - Tahnacious: Its just another part of personality typing
29/07/17, 23:10 - Tahnacious: There's three that correlate. Mbti, ennegrams (can't spell it but whatever.) And instinctual variants
29/07/17, 23:10 - Tahnacious: It is safe to say you are the sp variant.
29/07/17, 23:10 - Tahnacious: Using all 3 one can paint a fairly good picture of what someone is like as a person.
29/07/17, 23:18 - Infected: I read the definition of the sp variant and it didn't seem to apply to me very much.
29/07/17, 23:22 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
29/07/17, 23:50 - Tahnacious: It probably applies to you more than say the other variants do
29/07/17, 23:50 - Tahnacious: Which are very people orientated
29/07/17, 23:52 - Infected: Eww
30/07/17, 00:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah, ewww :P
30/07/17, 00:03 - Tahnacious: Me, I'd just be happy to find one special person to do everything with
30/07/17, 00:04 - Tahnacious: As long as they can respect my introversion
30/07/17, 00:04 - Tahnacious: Chances are if they're an introvert too their presence won't be taxing
30/07/17, 00:05 - Infected: I don't exactly have the healthiest mindset when it it comes to other people.
30/07/17, 00:05 - Tahnacious: That's OK though, means you steer clear of all their problems and drama.
30/07/17, 00:06 - Infected: I definitely do that.
30/07/17, 00:14 - Janith: What are we talking about?
30/07/17, 00:14 - Tahnacious: Instinctual variants
30/07/17, 00:15 - Tahnacious: Sp so and sx
30/07/17, 00:15 - Janith: What's the test?
30/07/17, 00:15 - Tahnacious: http://similarminds.com/variant.html
30/07/17, 00:15 - Janith: Thank you 😊
I'll check it out
30/07/17, 00:22 - Janith: That test was quite confusing
30/07/17, 00:23 - Infected: Agree.
30/07/17, 00:23 - Janith: It would have been more efficient to break the questions down into more specific ones.
30/07/17, 00:23 - Janith: Oh well
30/07/17, 00:24 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 00:24 - Janith: This is what I ended up getting
30/07/17, 00:25 - Infected: Interesting.
30/07/17, 00:30 - Janith: It's bullshit though. I'm not that social 😂
30/07/17, 00:31 - Janith: As for the sexual aspects, I guess I'm more sexual than the average NT but Meh
30/07/17, 00:32 - Tahnacious: Social is your lowest so it is like your inferior function
30/07/17, 00:34 - Janith: True. So what's the deal with the instinctual variants?
30/07/17, 00:35 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 00:35 - Infected: Another load of b.s. probably lol
30/07/17, 00:54 - Tahnacious: Has sort of happened to me, ya. It sucks.
30/07/17, 00:55 - Janith: 😂😂😂
30/07/17, 00:55 - Tahnacious: Just another form of typing which correlates to the mbti. Think of it as like a subtype.
30/07/17, 00:55 - Tahnacious: Physics class, had porn on laptop max volume... Wasn't rape though
30/07/17, 00:56 - Janith: I can't see what kind of predictions the instinctual variants can be used for though
30/07/17, 00:56 - Janith: Yikes...That must have been a fun class 😂
30/07/17, 00:57 - Tahnacious: Yeah thank god I'm an INTP and everyone in school by nature ignores my existence.
30/07/17, 00:59 - Tahnacious: It can predict what they have a tendency towards. Say for example Infected has the self preservation up high, meaning she is more likely than the average INTP to prefer staying by herself, away from the corruption of the outside world.
30/07/17, 01:00 - Janith: How did you fare in the test @61477394075?
30/07/17, 01:00 - Tahnacious: Me for example I have the sexual instinct higher so I have a tendency to go out and do things, possibly with one person, for the sake of obsession. More so than the average INTP
30/07/17, 01:01 - Shaiju: Stay away from 'Infected'!
30/07/17, 01:01 - Tahnacious: Sexual||||||||||||||||||58%Social|||||||||||||||46%Self Preservation|||||||||30%
30/07/17, 01:01 - Tahnacious: Oops
30/07/17, 01:01 - Tahnacious: Messy
30/07/17, 01:01 - Tahnacious: Sec
30/07/17, 01:01 - Tahnacious: Sexual||||||||||||||||||58%
Social|||||||||||||||46%
Self Preservation|||||||||30%
30/07/17, 01:03 - Janith: But since we all got around 50% for our highest variants wouldn't that mean we're generally with the average?
30/07/17, 01:03 - Tahnacious: It is only in terms of your base personality
30/07/17, 01:03 - Janith: 50 is the reasonable median here
30/07/17, 01:04 - Tahnacious: Instinctual variant is just that, a variant
30/07/17, 01:04 - Tahnacious: Of what is already an mbti type
30/07/17, 01:04 - Janith: I see. But what there's no population baseline to compare it to here
30/07/17, 01:05 - Janith: You can assume it's 50% but then it gets quite odd
30/07/17, 01:05 - Tahnacious: The % is more so you can tell which order they're in by how much
30/07/17, 01:05 - Tahnacious: If they're close then its too hard to make a call
30/07/17, 01:05 - Janith: Ooohh okay so more like a qualitative measure?
30/07/17, 01:05 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 01:05 - Tahnacious: Which comes 1st, which 2nd and which 3rd
30/07/17, 01:06 - Tahnacious: And the one that is 2nd is presumed to be greatest source of growth, like Ne in INTPs
30/07/17, 01:06 - Janith: I see how it's structured... Though the method is grossly inefficient
30/07/17, 01:06 - Janith: Shit. I'm tied 😂
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: Yeah its awkward to tell, you'd need another test to know lol
30/07/17, 01:07 - Janith: Wait. Ne is our greatest source of growth?
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: Of course
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: We rely on Ti
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: But if we harness our Ne
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: We reach out potential
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: *our
30/07/17, 01:07 - Janith: I'm not really sure how Ne works actually 😅
30/07/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: Haha
30/07/17, 01:08 - Janith: I just saw it as the source for all the randomness in our type
30/07/17, 01:08 - Tahnacious: Its more about thinking quickly on your feet and generating ideas and possibilities
30/07/17, 01:08 - Tahnacious: Yeah it is
30/07/17, 01:08 - Infected: More likely to survive an apocalypse, you mean.
30/07/17, 01:08 - Tahnacious: ^ that too I guess
30/07/17, 01:08 - Janith: Depends on the apocalypse my dear 😉
30/07/17, 01:09 - Janith: Considering an apocalypse scenario odds are that the group oriented people will have the highest chance of survival
30/07/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: In before LonerAIDs, transmitted by spending time alone. We are all screwed
30/07/17, 01:09 - Janith: Think about it, the more extroverted types would have the advantage of numbers.
30/07/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: I think Ti is brilliant for zombie apocalypses. Your friend got bit? No time to flaff about. Shoot em in the head. Fuck it. Decapitate them
30/07/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: No "I don't care if he is chewing at my foot, he's my best buddy!"
30/07/17, 01:11 - Janith: Considering we live in an era where most of us are specialized towards a particular skill we'd be much more efficient in groups than alone
30/07/17, 01:11 - Janith: Nooooo😱
30/07/17, 01:11 - Janith: He's still alive and able to move!
30/07/17, 01:11 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: True but we dont even want to be in a group
30/07/17, 01:11 - Tahnacious: I'd be the type to find a group then travel solo for a bit and regroup to find out what they're up to
30/07/17, 01:12 - Janith: He should use what little life he has to distract the zombies thereby giving the test of us a better chance
30/07/17, 01:12 - Tahnacious: Keep tabs on them then wander off on my own
30/07/17, 01:12 - Tahnacious: Not bad, not bad at all... Lol
30/07/17, 01:12 - Infected: I'd shoot my own mother in the head if she turned in to a zombie. That's what I'd want if I were dumb enough to get bitten by one.
30/07/17, 01:12 - Tahnacious: Or just chain him up and leave him as a distraction, win win. He dies anyway.
30/07/17, 01:12 - Janith: You're assuming you'd live long enough to get back with the group
30/07/17, 01:12 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Nooooo
30/07/17, 01:13 - Janith: Me I doubt I'd probably die pretty quick on my own. Probably because I forgot to eat or drink 😂
30/07/17, 01:13 - Tahnacious: If I was turning in to a zombie I'd prefer to be locked away and studied lol
30/07/17, 01:13 - Tahnacious: Damn lack of Se lol
30/07/17, 01:13 - Janith: Efficient. One to the head
30/07/17, 01:14 - Infected: I wouldn't mind being studied but I have an obligation to stay alive to protect my offspring.
30/07/17, 01:14 - Spaceexplorer: I would think Ne is the ability to peer lower than what is normally percieved and connect the basic value of the first object with the second..
Example...
A washing machne and  a drill, an Ne user would percieve the abstract value of the both the objects and then be able to make a connection in the outside world between the two objects,
Therefore Extroverted (outerworld),  Intuition(abstract connection)
30/07/17, 01:14 - Tahnacious: For me no offspring = no worries lol
30/07/17, 01:14 - Janith: Dibs on your body! 
I can do my undergraduate thesis on zombie physiology 😂
30/07/17, 01:15 - Tahnacious: Agreed :)
30/07/17, 01:15 - Spaceexplorer: 😂😂
30/07/17, 01:15 - Tahnacious: That's one way of saying it, for sure
30/07/17, 01:16 - Spaceexplorer: Ive always had a problem defining these terms...
30/07/17, 01:16 - Janith: You really could have a lot of fun with a washing machine and a drill
30/07/17, 01:17 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Ne really helpful when you're in a loop
30/07/17, 01:17 - Spaceexplorer: Have never found a definite anf satisfactory answer
30/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: I could think of many things.   Not all PG either
30/07/17, 01:17 - Janith: Hakuna Matata✋
30/07/17, 01:17 - Tahnacious: 🖖
30/07/17, 01:19 - Infected: Having one isn't too bad. I'd never have a second one.
30/07/17, 01:19 - Janith: Oohhh I like the way you think. All I got is sitting on the washing machine while it's vibrating with the drill on and singing the national anthem. Should sound pretty entertaining 😂
30/07/17, 01:19 - Spaceexplorer: 😂😂
30/07/17, 01:19 - Janith: If I ever have a kid it's probably gonna be the result of an experiment 😂
30/07/17, 01:20 - Janith: Would be fun to grow a kid in an artificial womb
30/07/17, 01:20 - Janith: You'd get a perfect view of the entire development of the embryo
30/07/17, 01:21 - Infected: https://youtu.be/u1hnBv12-uk
30/07/17, 01:21 - Infected: You can do this with a chicken rn.
30/07/17, 01:21 - Janith: And if you put it in an MRI you'd be able to record brain activity. Maybe figure out when babies actually start to perceive stiff
30/07/17, 01:21 - Janith: But that's no fun :(
30/07/17, 01:22 - Spaceexplorer: 👽👽🍿🍿🐌
30/07/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: Well actually if you add an appendage to the drill....
30/07/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: While on the washing machine...
30/07/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: Sounds interesting to me
30/07/17, 01:23 - Infected: The self thrusting dildo you mentioned yesterday? Maybe that was someone else though.
30/07/17, 01:23 - Infected: 👍🏻👍🏻
30/07/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: I've always seen babies as dumb but if they have thought patterns in the womb then that would be interesting
30/07/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: No, no that was definitely me...
30/07/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: 😅
30/07/17, 01:24 - Janith: Aww.. I was thinking a system to fire and replace drill bits
30/07/17, 01:24 - Infected: They aren't exactly dumb. Even as children they're still developing.
30/07/17, 01:24 - Janith: You could make a gun!
30/07/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: That sounds awesome!!
30/07/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: With a revolver if its a front loader!
30/07/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: True, they pick up a lot
30/07/17, 01:25 - Infected: Like a nail gun.
30/07/17, 01:26 - Janith: Yeah! Also the added angular momentum should help the bullets stay on a straight path over longer distances
30/07/17, 01:26 - Janith: Though I can't quite figure out a firing mechanism that doesn't involve too much tinkering
30/07/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: We need an INTJ around to make it for us... Lol
30/07/17, 01:26 - Janith: Can we use a nail gun instead?
30/07/17, 01:27 - Infected: Babies / children are interesting in the aspect of how much they are able to process and learn over a short amount of time.
30/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: I'll settle for that.
30/07/17, 01:27 - Janith: Drill with a dildo would work but drill gun is skeptical
30/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
30/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Drilldo
30/07/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Someone ™ that shit, fast!
30/07/17, 01:27 - Janith: Agreed. It's a dream of mine to get some babies in MRIs to see how they learn
30/07/17, 01:28 - Infected: I'm reminded of the jackhammer stake on "From Dusk Til Dawn" (the movie)
30/07/17, 01:28 - Janith: Men are never gonna be needed again 😂
30/07/17, 01:28 - Tahnacious: I want to see how much I can teach a child before primary school
30/07/17, 01:29 - Tahnacious: 😉
30/07/17, 01:29 - Tahnacious: I want to see if I can possibly have a kid that has done the entire kindergarten to year 6 curriculum before the age of 5
30/07/17, 01:29 - Infected: Especially not after the sex robots.
30/07/17, 01:30 - Janith: This! We could get a bunch of children, screen them for genetic traits for intelligence and get them learning quick till a certain age
30/07/17, 01:30 - Tahnacious: Then while everyone else is shoving finger paint up their noses maybe my kid will know some basics about science...
30/07/17, 01:30 - Infected: This has been done.
30/07/17, 01:30 - Janith: That would probably let us see the genetic component of intelligence in action
30/07/17, 01:30 - Tahnacious: I've done a genetics test and I already have some of the intelligence markers
30/07/17, 01:31 - Janith: It's so frustrating that human testing is no longer allowed 😭
30/07/17, 01:31 - Tahnacious: I know >_<
30/07/17, 01:32 - Janith: Well I was able to learn most all the way up to grade 11 in science when I was in grade 2 :3
30/07/17, 01:32 - Spaceexplorer: Have you heard of crispr?
30/07/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I was similar in school, I can only assume its an intp thing. Most of us were held back and unable to reach our true potential early :(
30/07/17, 01:33 - Spaceexplorer: Or something like that
30/07/17, 01:33 - Janith: I think the education system wastes the developmental years teaching at a ridiculously slow pace and then tries to cram most of the subjects I'm when we're overflowing with hormones
30/07/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: Thissss!!!
30/07/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: They also hold back too much to let the stupid kids catch up
30/07/17, 01:34 - Janith: No wonder the school system isn't doing too grew. It like trying to teach calculus to a bunch of horny chimps most of the time
30/07/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: They should have classes for advanced and not so advanced minds
30/07/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: Hahah
30/07/17, 01:34 - Infected: They do^^
30/07/17, 01:34 - Janith: Yaaaass the future!!
30/07/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: Yeah I lost interest in school and became obsessed with sex
30/07/17, 01:35 - Spaceexplorer: Is it really as amazing as they say?
30/07/17, 01:35 - Janith: I never had much interest to begin with but after puberty I got really interested in human sexuality too
30/07/17, 01:35 - Tahnacious: What is crispr?
30/07/17, 01:35 - Infected: But most notably not until high school. They have special classes in lower grades for advanced students but most of them are being shut down, from what I understand.
30/07/17, 01:36 - Janith: The evolutionary components, functional aspects, how it's one of most varied areas in the animal kingdom
30/07/17, 01:36 - Infected: My friends son was going to a gifted & talented elementary school and it closed.
30/07/17, 01:36 - Spaceexplorer: Could we identify the gene thats responsible for intellligence in humans and add it to a cat, and have talking pets?
30/07/17, 01:36 - Janith: Personally I find it to be even more so
30/07/17, 01:36 - Spaceexplorer: Or it dosnt work like that?
30/07/17, 01:36 - Janith: Gene editing with unparalleled accuracy
30/07/17, 01:36 - Tahnacious: No it doesn't work like that. They would have to have muscle function for talking toi
30/07/17, 01:36 - Tahnacious: *too
30/07/17, 01:36 - Tahnacious: Oooo cool
30/07/17, 01:37 - Spaceexplorer: Add those genes too
30/07/17, 01:37 - Infected: That would be cool but I don't think it works like that. The animal would need adjustments to its vocal cords and the ability to form words with its lips and tongue.
30/07/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: Essentially yeah
30/07/17, 01:37 - Janith: We could make a talking pet but it definitely wouldn't be a cat anymore!
30/07/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: But it might be possible if you adjusted the anatomy
30/07/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: But by then I'd rather just have the cat body myself
30/07/17, 01:37 - Spaceexplorer: I cant wait for a talkng cat
30/07/17, 01:38 - Tahnacious: I envy animals and their ability to run faster, smell and hear better than us
30/07/17, 01:38 - Spaceexplorer: Lion?
30/07/17, 01:38 - Infected: The best course would be an animal that already has similar anatomy to a human and just tweak it a bit.
30/07/17, 01:38 - Tahnacious: I'd probably vote jaguar or something a little more lithe
30/07/17, 01:38 - Janith: Basically starting off changing the brain to accomadate understanding of language, then vocal cords to speak followed by a change in the muscle and bone structure around the skull to support the new weight of the head
30/07/17, 01:39 - Infected: Over time you can perfect the procedure for adjusting the anatomy and move to other species.
30/07/17, 01:39 - Spaceexplorer: 👌
30/07/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: I think it would be better if animals understood us first honestly
30/07/17, 01:39 - Janith: Then the cardiovascular system to provide bloodflow to the new areas
30/07/17, 01:39 - Spaceexplorer: Now, would they have rights?
30/07/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: Then at least they can respond with body language
30/07/17, 01:39 - Spaceexplorer: Own property?
30/07/17, 01:39 - Infected: Domesticated animals already understand us better than we understand them.
30/07/17, 01:39 - Janith: Basically by the time they're done it would be a totally different species
30/07/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: I believe animals should have rights regardless...
30/07/17, 01:40 - Spaceexplorer: Absolutely
30/07/17, 01:40 - Janith: Which rights?
30/07/17, 01:41 - Spaceexplorer: Own property, marriage, run for president
30/07/17, 01:41 - Spaceexplorer: presidency
30/07/17, 01:41 - Janith: We could have those rights for them but first we need to cull the human population
30/07/17, 01:42 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 01:42 - Janith: There's already too many as it is. If we add another intelligent species here it's gonna get even more crowded
30/07/17, 01:43 - Spaceexplorer: Humans might accept it grudgingly after a century or two...
30/07/17, 01:43 - Infected: I read an interesting book about animals that had been experimented on and began to reason and be able to speak. They waged a war against humanity for their own rights and lands.
30/07/17, 01:43 - Janith: Can we kill the ones who don't? I don't like there being 7.8 billion of us
30/07/17, 01:44 - Janith: War of the planet of the apes?
30/07/17, 01:44 - Infected: No.
30/07/17, 01:44 - Infected: It was a crime novel, funny enough. A detective solving crimes with a k-9 partner.
30/07/17, 01:45 - Spaceexplorer: Its not as much as they make it seem... Even 10 billion is not tooo much
30/07/17, 01:45 - Spaceexplorer: Maybr when we reach 50 billion?
30/07/17, 01:45 - Janith: @61477394075 !! I didn't know you were a cosplayer 😍😍😍😍
30/07/17, 01:45 - Janith: Isn't a couple of million enough?
30/07/17, 01:46 - Janith: Any more seem unnecassary
30/07/17, 01:46 - Infected: Even though we aren't truly burdened by overpopulation, there are a number of reasons to reduce population, imo.
30/07/17, 01:46 - Spaceexplorer: We should kill all other types ...
30/07/17, 01:46 - Spaceexplorer: Couple million intps
30/07/17, 01:46 - Janith: Like humans are annoying as fuck sometimes
30/07/17, 01:46 - Spaceexplorer: Would be left
30/07/17, 01:46 - Spaceexplorer: 👌
30/07/17, 01:47 - Janith: Oh no...nothing would get done!
30/07/17, 01:47 - Infected: Not exactly reduce but cut down on the number of offspring people are allowed to have.
30/07/17, 01:47 - Janith: We need some Js too guys
30/07/17, 01:47 - Janith: Soo...can't kill them?
30/07/17, 01:47 - Infected: I don't like people but I wouldn't exactly protest for mass murder.
30/07/17, 01:47 - Spaceexplorer: Ok.. Intxs
30/07/17, 01:48 - Infected: Ethical / political dilemma.
30/07/17, 01:48 - Janith: Don't worry we'll make it seem like a tragic accident
30/07/17, 01:48 - Spaceexplorer: 😂😂😂
30/07/17, 01:48 - Janith: Zombie outbreak anyone?
30/07/17, 01:48 - Infected: Basically the premise of The Watchmen
30/07/17, 01:48 - Spaceexplorer: Thats seems plausible
30/07/17, 01:49 - Janith: What's that?
30/07/17, 01:49 - Infected: A viral epidemic would be more plausible.
30/07/17, 01:50 - Infected: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)
30/07/17, 01:50 - Janith: It's like you don't want to kill millions 😂😂
30/07/17, 01:50 - Infected: You can kill millions with the right virus.
30/07/17, 01:51 - Infected: Bio weapons are nothing new to science.
30/07/17, 01:51 - Janith: Yeah but it's no fun just watching them drop dead. If I want that I could just watch game of thrones or something
30/07/17, 01:52 - Janith: Can't we make a zombie outbreak and then kill the infected with giant robots instead?
30/07/17, 01:52 - Janith: I'll probably be checking out the movie
30/07/17, 01:53 - Janith: Yes I know how inefficient giant robots are but come on!
30/07/17, 01:53 - Janith: GIANT ROBOTS MANN!!!
30/07/17, 01:53 - Infected: We could but you have to be able to design the outbreak to have the desired outcome.
30/07/17, 01:54 - Janith: Maybe a genetic counter to terminate after a certain amount of generations
30/07/17, 01:54 - Infected: Which means you'd have to know rate of infection vs effectiveness of killing off the infected, among other things.
30/07/17, 01:55 - Spaceexplorer: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 01:55 - Infected: Dispersal of the virus, who would be infected, you'd have to already have means of termination in place without making it obvious that it's an intended outbreak.
30/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: Take a logistic model. Go for the highest plausible infection rate and let nature run its course. we'll probably end up with too little deaths but the rest of them we can dispose of because "collateral damage"
30/07/17, 01:56 - Janith: Religious institutions? 😆
30/07/17, 01:57 - Janith: Humans are quite fragile
30/07/17, 01:58 - Infected: If you had your guidelines for dealing with the virus and the means to terminate the infected already set up, you could infect as many people as you wanted to, really.
30/07/17, 01:59 - Infected: Religious institutions are integral for the politics of the plot. As well as government officials.
30/07/17, 01:59 - Janith: Better to aim for the lower end of the predictive model's accuracy.
30/07/17, 02:00 - Janith: So in one epidemic we would have dealt with overpopulation, resource scarcity, religious extremism and political idiots
30/07/17, 02:01 - Infected: Agreed
30/07/17, 02:01 - Janith: Now that's what I call a good day's work!
30/07/17, 02:01 - Infected: Essentially, yes. You would need to have at least some of these people on your side, though.
30/07/17, 02:02 - Infected: To effectively keep the populace where you need them to be and to be able to move about the infected areas freely.
30/07/17, 02:02 - Janith: That wouldn't be too hard. Just make up some religious excuse
30/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: Can we keep the pope alive though?
30/07/17, 02:03 - Janith: I like this one
30/07/17, 02:03 - Infected: You could probably find some way to tie it into the rapture/ end of the world/ antichrist scenario.
30/07/17, 02:04 - Janith: Then comes a trickier problem. How to get rid of the avocado wolfe crowd that isn't religious
30/07/17, 02:05 - Janith: I mean sure they're relatively harmless but also pretty annoying
30/07/17, 02:05 - Infected: Easy.
30/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Convince them that cyanice is the best natural rememdy for everything?
30/07/17, 02:07 - Infected: You set up a test system for weeding out the infected/ ill from the rest of the population. While doing this, you give them a short psych test of a few questions. The ones that raise suspicion are given the vaccine that either kills them or renders them sterile. Take your pick.
30/07/17, 02:09 - Infected: That would be a very large scale operation. It might be better to let the avocados live. Unless you had a way to cover that much ground.
30/07/17, 02:10 - Infected: That would be efficient.
30/07/17, 02:11 - Janith: True. Hopefully after all that's done the ENTPs and ENTJs will step up to round up whoever is left and will get people together
30/07/17, 02:12 - Janith: I still think we should get the INTP/J minds together and get a hive mind going
30/07/17, 02:12 - Infected: If you don't want to go through all that trouble, you could form an intp commune somewhere.
30/07/17, 02:12 - Janith: We could intergrate ourselves with AI
30/07/17, 02:13 - Janith: With the end goal being the creation of an intelligence capable of sending the remnants of the population into the stars
30/07/17, 02:14 - Infected: I like that idea. I don't think I'd do well in an intp/j community, though.
30/07/17, 02:14 - Janith: Not just INTPs but there was a model for an intellectual and high performing only community floating around the internet sometime back
30/07/17, 02:15 - Janith: We should establish areas like that where intellectuals can be separate from the rest of the world with their peers for extended durations
30/07/17, 02:16 - Janith: I'm guessing a problem most NTs share is the lack of other NTs in their physical environment
30/07/17, 02:18 - Infected: True.
30/07/17, 02:21 - Infected: Something like this would be interesting. 

http://inhabitat.com/plans-for-worlds-first-self-sufficient-floating-city-advance-to-next-phase/
30/07/17, 02:31 - Janith: A floating city and a space colony...I guess we're making up for the beachfront property we're losing cause climate change
30/07/17, 02:34 - Infected: I'm not a beach kind of person anyway. I'm more of a cave in a high mountain in the middle of a 1,000 acre wildlife reserve chick.
30/07/17, 02:37 - Janith: Nice. I prefer the ocean though. For me nothing beats the blue of the ocean
30/07/17, 02:37 - Janith: Anyway I gotta go now. Need to get some work done
30/07/17, 02:38 - Infected: 👋🏻
30/07/17, 02:38 - Tahnacious: Yeah :) it's good fun
30/07/17, 02:44 - Spaceexplorer: https://youtu.be/MnYppmstxIs
30/07/17, 02:47 - Tahnacious: Sounds excellent to me
30/07/17, 03:25 - Didier: I'm a 4w5 too
30/07/17, 03:27 - Tahnacious: Well that's interesting at least
30/07/17, 03:27 - Tahnacious: Its more uncommon but also so is sx/so for an intp hah
30/07/17, 03:28 - Tahnacious: I guess I'm an oddball gender for an oddball type with an oddball enneagram and oddball instinctual variant.
30/07/17, 03:28 - Tahnacious: 😣
30/07/17, 03:32 - Didier: That sounds like she has a weak Fe
30/07/17, 03:32 - Didier: I'm infp haha
30/07/17, 03:32 - Didier: My instinct is to mostly focus on satisfactory self-survival.
30/07/17, 03:32 - Didier: What does this one mean
30/07/17, 03:32 - Didier: I'm afraid I get the meaning wrong
30/07/17, 03:33 - Didier: 😂That's awesome
30/07/17, 03:33 - Didier: Oddballs are awesome 😜
30/07/17, 03:34 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
30/07/17, 03:34 - Didier: She sounds like an estj maybe...
30/07/17, 03:34 - Didier: I'll find out for u more
30/07/17, 03:34 - Tahnacious: Well 4w5 is normal for an INFP
30/07/17, 03:34 - Didier: My mom is an esfj and she drives me nuts
30/07/17, 03:34 - Didier: Haha yep
30/07/17, 03:35 - Tahnacious: Thanks for the input :)
30/07/17, 03:35 - Didier: I typed her as esfj and finally got her to do the test and I'm right
30/07/17, 03:35 - Didier: Dr Phil 🤣
30/07/17, 03:35 - Didier: Used to always watch it
30/07/17, 03:35 - Tahnacious: Ooooo nice
30/07/17, 03:35 - Tahnacious: I tried to get mum to do it but she "doesn't have time"
30/07/17, 03:36 - Tahnacious: It is a very hard call with my mum, we butt heads a lot
30/07/17, 03:37 - Tahnacious: I'll read up on both and see which one sounds more accurate
30/07/17, 03:38 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah, dishonesty and lies really piss her off
30/07/17, 03:38 - Didier: I noticed sensors
30/07/17, 03:38 - Didier: U have to force them to do these tests
30/07/17, 03:38 - Didier: Let me do more research for j
30/07/17, 03:39 - Didier: U*
30/07/17, 03:39 - Didier: Mind to tell me more info?
30/07/17, 03:39 - Didier: So,what does this mean?
30/07/17, 03:41 - Didier: She sounds like an unhealthy mbti type
30/07/17, 03:41 - Didier: This would make it more difticult to type
30/07/17, 03:44 - Tahnacious: Yeah I can tell you anything you like
30/07/17, 03:44 - Tahnacious: That you generally like privacy and feel comfortable when you know your needs are met
30/07/17, 03:44 - Tahnacious: The sort of person to put on a cup of tea of they feel cold or need to relax
30/07/17, 03:45 - Tahnacious: Etc
30/07/17, 03:45 - Tahnacious: But yeah I'd say my mum is fairly unhealthy hah
30/07/17, 03:46 - Didier: I noticed extroverts r more comfortable with going out than introverts
30/07/17, 03:46 - Didier: They would just go out with friends
30/07/17, 03:46 - Didier: Introverts would just rather stay at homr
30/07/17, 03:47 - Didier: And if ur mom is extroverted and u r introverted,
30/07/17, 03:47 - Didier: She would be lik why don't u go out more?
30/07/17, 03:47 - Didier: Make friends and stuff
30/07/17, 03:48 - Didier: But do not mix this up with people telling u to make more friends. (They can be introverts)
30/07/17, 03:48 - Didier: She is likely an extrovert if she "forces" u to do extrovert stuff
30/07/17, 03:52 - Didier: I err on the side of security even if it means playing it too safe or alternately confronting danger. How about this?
30/07/17, 03:57 - FABIO: Yesterday
30/07/17, 03:57 - FABIO: I Ass playing cs
30/07/17, 03:57 - FABIO: And a girl played... everyone mocked her
30/07/17, 03:57 - FABIO: Me too.. was funny
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: Today i changed my nickname and picture for the pic of my girl
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: And started to play
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: No pm e mocked
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: No one
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: Its not machism.or anything... we mock.everyone who plays bad
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: Hahahhahahaha
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: Specially if its a girl
30/07/17, 03:58 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂😂
30/07/17, 04:11 - Tahnacious: Yeah that sounds right
30/07/17, 04:11 - Janith: That sounds fair actually
30/07/17, 04:11 - Tahnacious: She doesn't force me to do going out type stuff but she is always happy to hear when I do
30/07/17, 04:11 - Tahnacious: She always used to bug me about boys I like
30/07/17, 04:13 - Tahnacious: She hated my MMOs though when I lived there
30/07/17, 04:13 - Tahnacious: She would say its 10pm, time for bed
30/07/17, 04:13 - Tahnacious: I'm disconnecting the internet.
30/07/17, 04:13 - Tahnacious: Then she would pull out the power cord for the modem and hide it -.-
30/07/17, 04:14 - Janith: 10?? But the night's just getting started!
30/07/17, 04:14 - Tahnacious: She was a big fan of finding out what I liked and using it against me
30/07/17, 04:14 - Tahnacious: Yup...
30/07/17, 04:14 - Tahnacious: So I'd be mid raid and then boom
30/07/17, 04:14 - Tahnacious: Random disconnect
30/07/17, 04:15 - Tahnacious: Or she would confiscate my gameboy or n64
30/07/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: She also insisted that I get dressed up and wear make up to go to the cinemas
30/07/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: Because presentation is essential or some BS...
30/07/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: And I should wear make up wherever I go because you never know when some talent agent might spot me
30/07/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: Ughhhh... As if I even CARE!!
30/07/17, 04:17 - Janith: Wow...
30/07/17, 04:17 - Tahnacious: Yeah she is a bit psycho :D
30/07/17, 04:17 - Tahnacious: Not a very likeable personality
30/07/17, 04:18 - Janith: How did you not give yourself a concussion from all the face-palms you must have gone through with her?
30/07/17, 04:18 - Tahnacious: She's also hated every bf I had
30/07/17, 04:18 - Tahnacious: No, instead I just let my fe out privately
30/07/17, 04:18 - Tahnacious: Chewed my pillow and carved "my mum is a bitch" in to the wall
30/07/17, 04:18 - Tahnacious: Hah
30/07/17, 04:19 - Janith: 😂 that works
30/07/17, 04:19 - Tahnacious: Cried and yelled in to my pillow
30/07/17, 04:19 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah, its still there years later.
30/07/17, 04:20 - Janith: Never tried sweet revenge? 😆
30/07/17, 04:20 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 04:27 - Didier: I mean,what does that mean?
30/07/17, 04:39 - Tahnacious: Means you're not particularly inclined towards risky behaviour
30/07/17, 04:41 - FABIO: they added me
30/07/17, 04:41 - FABIO: LOL
30/07/17, 04:48 - Tahnacious: Not yet haha
30/07/17, 04:50 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I think its J, because they have a habit of commanding and wanting it to go their way.
30/07/17, 04:51 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm leaning towards it even though she's lazy and disorganised... Simply because she's always pent up
30/07/17, 04:58 - Maureen: what are you talking about? I don't want to go through 400 messages
30/07/17, 04:59 - Tahnacious: I talked about typing my mum
30/07/17, 04:59 - Tahnacious: And instinctual variants
30/07/17, 04:59 - Tahnacious: There was blab about creating intelligent animals
30/07/17, 04:59 - Tahnacious: And culling off the populace :)
30/07/17, 05:00 - Tahnacious: Sometimes I worry I'm overly chatty....
30/07/17, 05:00 - Tahnacious: Maybe we should nuke an ENFJ chat
30/07/17, 05:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Do you know about one?
30/07/17, 05:03 - Tahnacious: No, I wish haha
30/07/17, 05:04 - Tahnacious: But let me know if anyone finds one
30/07/17, 05:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Me too
30/07/17, 05:06 - Maureen: why?
30/07/17, 05:06 - Maureen: how are they?
30/07/17, 05:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: ENFPs too
30/07/17, 05:06 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I swear I'm gonna end up killing one some day
30/07/17, 05:09 - Maureen: just looked it up... one of the most inspiring people I've met last year is an ENFJ
30/07/17, 05:10 - Tahnacious: Ughhhhh enfps are worse yes
30/07/17, 05:10 - Tahnacious: At least enfjs emote more outwardly so their reactions to trolling are more humorous
30/07/17, 05:10 - Maureen: K, maybe she's more an ENFP
30/07/17, 05:11 - Maureen: or let's say ENF*
30/07/17, 05:11 - Maureen: if she wasn't married I'd fall for her 😂
30/07/17, 05:11 - Tahnacious: Besides, trolling is the way to the heart.
30/07/17, 05:11 - Tahnacious: :D
30/07/17, 05:11 - Tahnacious: Hahah
30/07/17, 05:31 - Spaceexplorer: 😂😂😂👌👌
30/07/17, 05:59 - Tel: 😂
30/07/17, 06:04 - FABIO: me too
30/07/17, 06:20 - Tel: ISTJ - much more detail oriented and will follow instructions given guidance
30/07/17, 06:21 - Tahnacious: Fair point
30/07/17, 06:28 - Tel: Just FYI - each generation would involve a mass slaughter, as most ppl are born non-INT*.
30/07/17, 06:30 - Tahnacious: Honestly I think the best way is to abort nonviable or unwanted babies and impose a 2 child max law. Eventually the population will decline
30/07/17, 06:31 - Tahnacious: When I see families of 5+ I start thinking of the impact that's having on the world plus how much the parents would've struggled and how little individual attention each child gets
30/07/17, 06:32 - Tel: You're still awake @61477394075? I've just had a nice sleep! Haha
30/07/17, 06:32 - Tahnacious: Haha yeah I'm still up.
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: Sleep is for the weak! 🤣
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tel: Good effort. That vampirism gene you have definitely worth researching and looking to go to market.. Not just for avoiding sleep reasons, but also for an alternative to the zombie apocalypse above
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tel: (were INTPs, sure, but we can be the few that would consider a plan B in advance rather than making it up on the spur of the moment..)
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: I would love to be a vampire hah
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tel: We're
30/07/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: As long as I don't have to sparkle.
30/07/17, 06:34 - Tel: Interesting. The number declines with wealth / education anyway, according to stats.
30/07/17, 06:34 - Tel: Sparkle? What vampires even sparkle?
30/07/17, 06:36 - Tahnacious: Twilight vampires 🤢
30/07/17, 06:38 - Tel: Ah. Odd. Haven't seen it
30/07/17, 06:38 - Tel: Certainly the right idea if they're sparkly!
30/07/17, 06:38 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Me too.
30/07/17, 06:39 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are quite confused with what they actually are and what they react
30/07/17, 06:40 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And an unnecessarily a social butterfly
30/07/17, 06:40 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Girls , the most
30/07/17, 06:40 - Tahnacious: I once dated an ENFP, never again...
30/07/17, 06:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I had a crush on an ENFP
30/07/17, 06:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Regretted a lot
30/07/17, 06:41 - Tahnacious: Anyone here had intp/intp relations?
30/07/17, 06:41 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am in love with an INFP
30/07/17, 06:42 - Tahnacious: Infps are nice...
30/07/17, 06:42 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: No
30/07/17, 06:42 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are not nice
30/07/17, 06:42 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: They are lovely😍😘
30/07/17, 06:42 - Tahnacious: Haha
30/07/17, 06:43 - Tahnacious: I have issues with the inferior Te
30/07/17, 06:43 - Tel: Mine was an ESFJ. Couldn't have been further apart
30/07/17, 06:43 - Tel: Haven't actually analysed it re mbti though
30/07/17, 06:43 - Tahnacious: Uses the same functions though, in opposite order
30/07/17, 06:44 - Tel: Yea
30/07/17, 06:44 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: But my brother. He is an ENFP
30/07/17, 06:44 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And he is way too rational
30/07/17, 06:44 - Tahnacious: I don't know what would be my best match honestly
30/07/17, 06:44 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Almost an INTP/INTJ
30/07/17, 06:44 - Tahnacious: Maybe an entp?
30/07/17, 06:44 - Tel: ENTPs are cool
30/07/17, 06:44 - Tahnacious: Weird
30/07/17, 06:45 - Tahnacious: Extroverts bring me out of my shell a little but they can also exhaust me
30/07/17, 06:45 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Which Personality Type is Your Love Match?

https://www.truity.com/test/personality-type-love-match
30/07/17, 06:46 - Tahnacious: I just want someone who can Fe me the way I can Fe them :(
30/07/17, 06:46 - Tel: Yea.. I'd like something opposite (I still have lots of projects in my house to finish....!), but long term? Hm.
30/07/17, 06:46 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Yeah he is an ambivert
30/07/17, 06:47 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Opposite of INTP is ESFJ. Never ever do the tedious mistake of dating one. You will literally bang your head and tear your hair I you do that
30/07/17, 06:49 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: INFP can do that. 😉. And they are rational as well. They also like discussing abstract concepts. Also have interest in mbti. And in many cases, they have characteristics of INTP. What else could I want ??
30/07/17, 06:51 - Tahnacious: I got ENTJ in that test
30/07/17, 06:51 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 06:52 - Tahnacious: Lucky you haha
30/07/17, 06:53 - Tahnacious: I want someone intelligent... But I don't know if I could handle another thinker
30/07/17, 06:53 - Tahnacious: Feelers attract me somehow
30/07/17, 06:54 - Tahnacious: I want someone who can accept my clumsy Fe and return the favours... I always saw Fi as too self centered to be capable of that
30/07/17, 06:54 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Any intuitive naturally becomes my friend
30/07/17, 06:54 - Tahnacious: This
30/07/17, 06:54 - Didier: Why can't handle another thinker?
30/07/17, 06:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Just imagine dating someone like yourself
30/07/17, 06:55 - Tahnacious: Because every T relationship I've been in has been entirely loveless.
30/07/17, 06:55 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Thinker doesn't mean emotionless
30/07/17, 06:55 - Tahnacious: :(
30/07/17, 06:55 - Tahnacious: I know...
30/07/17, 06:55 - Didier: It's weird but I've noticed types with inferior Fe are more self-centered.Rather than self-centered for Fi,maybe self-absorbed?
30/07/17, 06:55 - Didier: Hahaha
30/07/17, 06:56 - Didier: Wait a min lemme get my info
30/07/17, 06:56 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I am a thinker and I usually wonder how I can have such strong emotions...
30/07/17, 06:56 - Tahnacious: I had a two year relationship once. Part wag through we decided that we would never discuss or feel "love" and left it at that
30/07/17, 06:56 - Didier: U might want someone with a stronger Fe
30/07/17, 06:57 - Tahnacious: It was a biiiig struggle for me because my feelings slip through the cracks
30/07/17, 06:57 - Didier: Maybe INFJ is good?
30/07/17, 06:57 - Didier: I have an INFJ friend
30/07/17, 06:57 - Didier: We have totally diff functions yet
30/07/17, 06:57 - Tahnacious: But it is hard to make them snowball if I can't get any feedback
30/07/17, 06:57 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 06:57 - Didier: We get along very well
30/07/17, 06:57 - Tahnacious: I don't know any but I'd be game.
30/07/17, 06:57 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: And your ideal love partner too😜😝
30/07/17, 06:57 - Didier: INFJs are rather sociable too
30/07/17, 06:58 - Didier: I nearly though she's an extrovert but then I realised she's an introvert just like me
30/07/17, 06:58 - Tahnacious: I dated an intp too, it as the mist comfortable relationship I've been in but the whole time it just felt like we were friends
30/07/17, 06:58 - Didier: That explained why though she seemed outgoing,I felt comfortable with her (as if she's another introvert,and she is)
30/07/17, 06:58 - Didier: Not sure 😂
30/07/17, 06:58 - Tahnacious: I broke it off after he started owing me too much money and then all of a sudden BOOM ... Fe
30/07/17, 06:58 - Tahnacious: He went nuts
30/07/17, 06:59 - Tahnacious: Pity because if I had've known his feelings about me earlier more thoroughly I may have tried harder to work it out.
30/07/17, 06:59 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ummmm it came in the test last time I had shared the same link
30/07/17, 07:00 - Didier: So,he is also an intp?
30/07/17, 07:00 - Tel: 😂
30/07/17, 07:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: What do you mean "he"? You are a girl ?😳
30/07/17, 07:00 - Tahnacious: Yeah this guy was an intp as well
30/07/17, 07:00 - Didier: She is a girl haha...
30/07/17, 07:00 - Tahnacious: You didn't know this? Lol
30/07/17, 07:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Ok this usually happens
30/07/17, 07:00 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: In this group
30/07/17, 07:00 - Didier: I can't imagine intp and intp being lovers
30/07/17, 07:01 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: I can only imagine them as friends because
30/07/17, 07:01 - Tahnacious: Unless that looks manly... Idk
30/07/17, 07:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I that's you ?
30/07/17, 07:01 - Tahnacious: Haha
30/07/17, 07:01 - Tahnacious: Yes
30/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: Coo
30/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: I
30/07/17, 07:01 - Didier: I love black 😍
30/07/17, 07:01 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Lmao
30/07/17, 07:01 - Tahnacious: I have too much of an hourglass, I did acting too and they made me play male parts... Not too convincingly >_<
30/07/17, 07:02 - Tahnacious: Haha, black is so easy to wear
30/07/17, 07:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: I was imagining you as 17year old skinny boy
30/07/17, 07:02 - Didier: Lol...
30/07/17, 07:02 - Didier: How old are you Tahnee?
30/07/17, 07:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Above 20
30/07/17, 07:02 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Hey wait
30/07/17, 07:02 - Tahnacious: 25, why?
30/07/17, 07:03 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Remember what we discussed earlier ?
30/07/17, 07:03 - Tahnacious: Yes...?
30/07/17, 07:03 - Didier: Tahnee,have u tried being with an INFJ?
30/07/17, 07:03 - Tahnacious: Not yet, haven't found one
30/07/17, 07:03 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: Not asking a girl her age..... Or natural hair color.....
30/07/17, 07:03 - Didier: Yeah they r quite rare
30/07/17, 07:04 - ‪+91 95541 37104‬: About 1% or less
30/07/17, 07:04 - Tahnacious: Lol I don't really care. . I'm naturally a chestnuttish colour. Dark reddish brown
30/07/17, 07:04 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 07:05 - Didier: I can spot ISTJs in my school easily
30/07/17, 07:05 - Didier: Those who score very well
30/07/17, 07:05 - Didier: And likes to laugh at random things
30/07/17, 07:05 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah I've seen istjs
30/07/17, 07:05 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I didnt read your conversation.
Guys do u think it's actually good to have a relationship with an E?
30/07/17, 07:05 - Didier: It depends on the E
30/07/17, 07:06 - Didier: ESFPs are too extroverted
30/07/17, 07:06 - Didier: I can only be friends with them
30/07/17, 07:06 - Tahnacious: Entps are ok
30/07/17, 07:06 - Didier: I'm good with enfps
30/07/17, 07:06 - Didier: Entps
30/07/17, 07:06 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Enfj
30/07/17, 07:06 - Tahnacious: They're the most introverted extroverts
30/07/17, 07:06 - Didier: I don't know if I've met an enfj though
30/07/17, 07:06 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: But his ideal type is enfp 😔
30/07/17, 07:06 - Tahnacious: I don't know any enfjs
30/07/17, 07:07 - Didier: I have my ideals but
30/07/17, 07:07 - Didier: Who I like are always not my ideals
30/07/17, 07:07 - Tahnacious: I wouldn't mind a J type. Never dated one
30/07/17, 07:07 - Didier: So u got a chance
30/07/17, 07:07 - Tahnacious: I'd like to not have to be the one to take charge in every relationship
30/07/17, 07:08 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Nice to hear this
30/07/17, 07:08 - Didier: I am thinking that infj is the best for u Tahnee hehe
30/07/17, 07:08 - Tahnacious: :)
30/07/17, 07:08 - Tahnacious: Help me find one! Lol
30/07/17, 07:08 - Didier: I can imagine enfj being too outgoing
30/07/17, 07:09 - Didier: It depends on u too
30/07/17, 07:09 - Didier: Compromise and acceptance,very important
30/07/17, 07:09 - Tahnacious: Yeah depends on how social you are as an intp
30/07/17, 07:09 - Didier: Both parties
30/07/17, 07:10 - Tahnacious: I can compromise on a lot of things, I just have general standards
30/07/17, 07:10 - Didier: I can imagine myself getting along with enfjs a bit
30/07/17, 07:10 - Didier: They r quite rare too?
30/07/17, 07:10 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Yes he is
30/07/17, 07:11 - Tahnacious: Less rare
30/07/17, 07:11 - Tahnacious: But still rare
30/07/17, 07:11 - Didier: As long as u
30/07/17, 07:11 - Didier: Don't mind going out
30/07/17, 07:11 - Didier: With him
30/07/17, 07:12 - Didier: I think it's fine?
30/07/17, 07:12 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Im very lack in that 😕
30/07/17, 07:12 - Tahnacious: I will leave the house with the right person for almost any reason
30/07/17, 07:12 - Didier: As long as u don't mind going out with him
30/07/17, 07:13 - Didier: And don't always hide ur feelings
30/07/17, 07:13 - Tahnacious: I'd have to be in a very "mind shell" mood for someone to say they're going to the store to get dinner and not join them
30/07/17, 07:13 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Im only good to be with him, not with other human beings
30/07/17, 07:13 - Tahnacious: I hide my feelings until such point as I feel it is safe to show them
30/07/17, 07:13 - Tahnacious: Then they flood out of control
30/07/17, 07:14 - Tahnacious: I can keep PokerFace as long as needed... Months... Years...
30/07/17, 07:14 - Didier: It also depends on the extrovert u r with
30/07/17, 07:14 - Didier: Some take care of their introvert friends
30/07/17, 07:14 - Tahnacious: As soon as someone is sentimental or gives me the space and security I need to be emotional I let it run free
30/07/17, 07:14 - Tahnacious: It is very liberating after caging it up for so long
30/07/17, 07:15 - Tahnacious: Otherwise... I let it seep out while watching movies alone instead 😅
30/07/17, 07:19 - Didier: Watching movies are the best
30/07/17, 07:19 - Tel: I can resonate with that.. I like meaningful films as you can explore your own emotions through them, if that makes sense
30/07/17, 07:20 - Didier: I'm not surprised,because if u were to be an infp,feelings would run wild,painful as hell.So I'm not surprised that intps are afraid of emotions
30/07/17, 07:20 - Tel: Obv not quite like when watching Schindler's List you find yourself dealing with your sadistic maniacal traits (well, some might..), but more base emotions. Hm. Prob expmianing it terribly :)
30/07/17, 07:20 - Tel: Hm, afraid or just not as in tune / aware of how they can help?
30/07/17, 07:21 - Tel: I wouldn't say I'm afraid; more just was unaware of their usefulness. Perhaps afraid of admitting weakness before; now I find it's a nice shield, perversely
30/07/17, 07:21 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Intps are not afraid of emotion, they don't understand emotion imo
30/07/17, 07:21 - Didier: Yeah that's right
30/07/17, 07:21 - Didier: They do not understand enough
30/07/17, 07:22 - Didier: That's why I think they need a healthy feeler
30/07/17, 07:22 - Didier: Because emotions if used correctly,can be useful
30/07/17, 07:22 - Tel: 👍🏻
30/07/17, 07:22 - Tahnacious: I am both
30/07/17, 07:22 - Didier: I don't know how to explain actually
30/07/17, 07:22 - Tahnacious: If I don't understand my emotion I am afraid of it
30/07/17, 07:23 - Tahnacious: One time I actually felt so much love I freaked out ...
30/07/17, 07:23 - Tahnacious: And started crying >_<
30/07/17, 07:23 - Tahnacious: So bad... And embarassing!
30/07/17, 07:23 - Didier: Yep that'e what I mean
30/07/17, 07:23 - Didier: Haha
30/07/17, 07:23 - Didier: That sounds so cute ><
30/07/17, 07:23 - Tahnacious: 😣
30/07/17, 07:24 - Didier: It seems like we'll get along
30/07/17, 07:24 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Not necessarily
30/07/17, 07:24 - Tahnacious: I couldn't explain my emotion either because it was too intense
30/07/17, 07:24 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Define useful
30/07/17, 07:24 - Didier: Yeah
30/07/17, 07:24 - Didier: Because thinkers are feelers too
30/07/17, 07:25 - Didier: Like I know ISTJs,they all laugh at little things
30/07/17, 07:25 - Didier: But they follow their head rather than heart
30/07/17, 07:25 - Didier: So a thinker that can help another thinker
30/07/17, 07:25 - Tahnacious: I had trouble as a teen because I kept dismissing logic because Ooo look, a shiny boy
30/07/17, 07:26 - Tahnacious: Doesn't matter if its a bad idea
30/07/17, 07:26 - Tahnacious: Because hormones™
30/07/17, 07:26 - Didier: Emotions are like that
30/07/17, 07:26 - Didier: You may not know why u feel it
30/07/17, 07:26 - Didier: But there's always a reason
30/07/17, 07:26 - Tahnacious: Yeah...
30/07/17, 07:26 - Didier: It's like a summary of what u feel/actually think of towards something
30/07/17, 07:27 - Tahnacious: Just overwhelming anything, bad or good, is enough to provoke a breakdown
30/07/17, 07:27 - Didier: Feelings and thinking are actually not two separats things
30/07/17, 07:27 - Tahnacious: Or existential crisis
30/07/17, 07:27 - Tel: Glitter vamps?
30/07/17, 07:27 - Tahnacious: Lol!
30/07/17, 07:27 - Tel: It's OK. You were their target demographic I think.. :p
30/07/17, 07:28 - Tahnacious: -.- oh god please no, hah
30/07/17, 07:28 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 07:28 - Tahnacious: I know what you mean but it feels like there's a dam in the way
30/07/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: Thoughts flow freely
30/07/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: Feels get backed up in the dam
30/07/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: Then every now and then
30/07/17, 07:29 - Didier: Feelings are neither logical nor illogical.They just tend to lead to more irrational behaviour
30/07/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: JESUS CHRIST EVERYONE RUN, THE FLOODGATE IS OPEN!
30/07/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 07:29 - Didier: But if thinkers do not understand their emotions enough,it may lead to irrational behaviour too
30/07/17, 07:29 - Didier: I know because I've met someone like that
30/07/17, 07:30 - Tahnacious: It is good to have some element of balance
30/07/17, 07:30 - Didier: Yep
30/07/17, 07:30 - Tahnacious: At least I try....
30/07/17, 07:31 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 07:33 - Tel: Yea, it's a different process I think. Thoughts I work through. Feelings I just accept and become aware of - 'how do I feel? Hm, ok. Why? Ok. Can I do anything to improve it? Ok.' (I even talk about them with friends (sometimes). #intermediateFe?)
30/07/17, 07:34 - Tel: 😂
30/07/17, 07:35 - Tel: And then you get embarrassed by it and wish you hadn't.
30/07/17, 07:35 - Tel: I think the key is to controlling the floodgates - open them as much as you need to, rather than pouring everything out, or waiting until it overspills
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tahnacious: Yeah, currently working on that
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tel: The key, then, is to model yourself on a good hydroelectric dam
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tel: :)
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tahnacious: I just don't have anywhere I can freely emote
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tahnacious: No one to express anything towards
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tahnacious: That is an awesome way of putting it
30/07/17, 07:36 - Tel: Hm, inf* are good (@6582280971) !
30/07/17, 07:37 - Tahnacious: I could probably date another intp but only if they were very well rounded and were capable of expressing Fe like me.
30/07/17, 07:37 - Tel: Yea, I was just thinking the same thing
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: I was very happy in the actual relationship itself
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: It was so comfortable
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tel: My only issue remains the incomplete projects..
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tel: :D
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: I had the intellectual stumuli, I had my own personal space too
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: A gaming partner, someone to be lazy with
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tel: I think perhaps the Fe can overcome that perhaps (spending time with each other by doing stuff in proximity). Idano.
30/07/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: Same taste in movies
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tel: Yea
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tahnacious: It was sooooo relaxing
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tel: Sounds bliss
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tel: What didn't work though?
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tahnacious: He had no job
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tahnacious: And I had paid over $10k to look after him
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tel: Ah
30/07/17, 07:39 - Tahnacious: There were no significant expressions of love so I questioned if it was worth it
30/07/17, 07:40 - Tahnacious: Or if someone else was capable of loving me more than he did
30/07/17, 07:40 - Tahnacious: He had very repressed Fe
30/07/17, 07:41 - Tahnacious: I want someone who is financially independent because in every relationship I, as an intp female at that.... Have had to be the moneymaker
30/07/17, 07:41 - Tahnacious: And I don't even have a degree yet!
30/07/17, 07:41 - Tahnacious: People who are 3x lazier than I am just won't cut it
30/07/17, 07:42 - Tahnacious: Gotta be on my level of laziness which is "I'll get up off my arse and do something about it... Sometimes"
30/07/17, 07:42 - Tahnacious: Or better... Hah
30/07/17, 07:43 - Tahnacious: I've worked really hard just to keep boys financially afloat before and it stresses me out :( I very much need me time.
30/07/17, 07:43 - Tel: Lol! Yea, that sounds like a good level
30/07/17, 07:44 - Tel: Fe sounds fairly decent, in that you're lookin to harmonise externally a lot then?
30/07/17, 07:44 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm not a Nazi but I do take care of what's expected of me, and a little more if you're lucky/I'm in a good mood
30/07/17, 07:44 - Tel: You seem pretty self aware in that respect too
30/07/17, 07:44 - Tahnacious: I guess I would say so, yes
30/07/17, 07:45 - Tahnacious: As long as someone isn't overbearing but can understand my wavelength
30/07/17, 07:45 - Tahnacious: I try to be. Understanding my inner workings is a project itself.
30/07/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: The way I see it is if I have a good outlet for positive Fe use then it prevents me from having moments of negative Fe use.
30/07/17, 07:47 - Tahnacious: When I get mad I can just PokerFace Ti my way out of it rather than yelling
30/07/17, 07:47 - Tahnacious: I don't get mad often, but people can't tell when I do either anyway
30/07/17, 07:48 - Didier: I think you can call feelings a compass.Should I do that?Am I happy with that?Will I regret that?Thinking is like spotting whether the compass i spoilt.I think I should do that instead?
30/07/17, 07:48 - Didier: So,feelings are important so that u can live with no regrets
30/07/17, 07:48 - Tel: Yea, I think INTPs are v hard working at improving self's. That's what I've read - haven't thought about why mbti profile dictates that though
30/07/17, 07:48 - Didier: Thinking is important so that u can live with no regrets too
30/07/17, 07:49 - Didier: That's why a balance is important.If not,their purpose is lost.U will probably end up with regrets.
30/07/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: Yeah. There have been many circumstances in which I wish I relied on my brain
30/07/17, 07:49 - Didier: is*
30/07/17, 07:49 - Tel: Yup! I get more and more polite. I think I  anget v frustrated v quickly if I get an F* response back. Or perhaps an illogical T* response.. Need to re-analyse
30/07/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: Like Derp its a bad idea to go somewhere you don't know in the middle of the night when you're a teeh
30/07/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: *teen
30/07/17, 07:50 - Tel: Definitely! That's a v useful analogy
30/07/17, 07:50 - Tel: On that note, one area I'm trying to develop is doing what I want to feel like doing, rather than what's logical
30/07/17, 07:50 - Tahnacious: I can relate to this! If I am making a point of being very polite in a stressful circumstance then I am definitely grabbing Fe by the head and holding it under the water so no one can hear it
30/07/17, 07:51 - Tel: It was a small step on Fri night, for instance, when I just left the night out because I felt like it - rather than waiting for everyone else 😂
30/07/17, 07:51 - Tel: Lol! Exactly. Good explanation
30/07/17, 07:51 - Didier: I'm trying to work on what I think I should do rather than what I feel like doing
30/07/17, 07:51 - Didier: Haha
30/07/17, 07:52 - Tel: Interesting.
30/07/17, 07:52 - Didier: I'm an infp anyway
30/07/17, 07:52 - Tel: Really? We can help with that :)
30/07/17, 07:52 - Tel: Quid pro quo!
30/07/17, 07:52 - Didier: Need to control my feelings 😔
30/07/17, 07:52 - Tel: One of my INFJ friends is too dreamy. I had to knock that out of her
30/07/17, 07:52 - Tahnacious: Yeah I often leave without letting people know...
30/07/17, 07:53 - Tahnacious: *poof* *vanish*
30/07/17, 07:53 - Tel: 'you're not Gna be an author. At least, probably not. Get a job and if the author stuff happens, quit your job. But have a logical plan and calculate better!'
30/07/17, 07:53 - Tahnacious: I don't mind dreamy
30/07/17, 07:53 - Didier: What does this mean?
30/07/17, 07:53 - Tel: Have done that too
30/07/17, 07:53 - Tel: Something for something, basically. It's Latin
30/07/17, 07:54 - Tel: 'Money for that' might be literal? Unsure. Will check
30/07/17, 07:54 - Tahnacious: That's good advice. Focus on the practical route first then when the nice thing you wanna do has an opportunity to shine you have the resources to go for it, full speed ahead!
30/07/17, 07:54 - Tel: This for that, not money
30/07/17, 07:55 - Tel: English use quid for money.. I wonder if it derived from the Latin then. H.
30/07/17, 07:55 - Didier: Haha
30/07/17, 07:55 - Tel: Hm*
30/07/17, 07:55 - Tel: Exactly.
30/07/17, 07:55 - Didier: Is this what u said to her?
30/07/17, 07:55 - Tahnacious: I have a problem with following good advice for some reason though :( lol
30/07/17, 07:55 - Tahnacious: Especially if it is my own self help and advice
30/07/17, 07:56 - Tel: Dreamy good. But restrained / controlled dreamy. Or logical dreamy. I mean, I fantasise about lots of stuff, but doesn't mean I'm Gna take illogical steps toward them n p
30/07/17, 07:56 - Tel: ;p*
30/07/17, 07:56 - Didier: I always tell good advice but I can't folloe through it too
30/07/17, 07:56 - Tahnacious: This
30/07/17, 07:56 - Didier: This is the time when I wish I can be an ISTJ
30/07/17, 07:56 - Didier: They have no problem with school
30/07/17, 07:57 - Tel: Well, in not so mean terms I guess. She ended up listening, several years after the fact. She published a book, it wasn't a success, and now she's getting an office job in a v good career that'll make excellent use of her INFJ. She'll also. Keep her author stuff up
30/07/17, 07:57 - Tel: Eugh. Never. 🤢
30/07/17, 07:57 - Didier: That's good
30/07/17, 07:57 - Didier: So,do u get along with her?
30/07/17, 07:57 - Tel: Yup, best friends. Been about 10 years or so
30/07/17, 07:57 - Didier: So that I can get work done easily
30/07/17, 07:58 - Tel: Yea, even so. The sacrifice you'd be making... 😂
30/07/17, 07:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: *poof vanish*
30/07/17, 07:58 - Didier: Do u think intps and infj are good dating partners?
30/07/17, 07:59 - Tel: Hm, good q. I have a natural tendency to hang with INFJs. Dated one (her!) before. Didn't work with her as she's religious though. Plus she's too tame.
30/07/17, 07:59 - Tahnacious: I think NT and NF have a certain attraction
30/07/17, 07:59 - Tahnacious: Hahah, fuck tame
30/07/17, 07:59 - Tahnacious: I need a wild child
30/07/17, 08:00 - Tahnacious: One on one >.> obviously
30/07/17, 08:00 - Tel: Yes, exactly tahnee
30/07/17, 08:00 - Tel: Wild is good
30/07/17, 08:00 - Didier: Too tame?
30/07/17, 08:01 - Didier: Yeah,kinda I agree😂
30/07/17, 08:01 - Tahnacious: I want someone who can keep up with my Ne
30/07/17, 08:01 - Didier: U might get along with infps then Tahnee
30/07/17, 08:01 - Didier: Same level of Ne too
30/07/17, 08:01 - Tel: Yea. Too straight and narrow. Idano how to explain. Just not crazy enough. Haha
30/07/17, 08:01 - Didier: I'm one hehe
30/07/17, 08:01 - Tahnacious: I daresay yes, my best friend is an infp
30/07/17, 08:01 - Tahnacious: I seem to attract them like magnets because I'm naturally arty and creative
30/07/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: I have long winding story arcs and they enjoy listening
30/07/17, 08:02 - Didier: Ooo
30/07/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: Hard to find someone who cares
30/07/17, 08:02 - Didier: Hmm
30/07/17, 08:02 - Didier: U'll find someone better I guess
30/07/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: I want to direct animated films one day
30/07/17, 08:02 - Didier: Do u get along with them then?
30/07/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: See my stories come to life
30/07/17, 08:02 - Didier: Cool,I'll support u
30/07/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: Of course
30/07/17, 08:03 - Tahnacious: As long as I don't accidentally say something that offends... 😅
30/07/17, 08:03 - Didier: Infps always care about ppl important to them so
30/07/17, 08:03 - Didier: Good luck
30/07/17, 08:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 08:03 - Didier: Haha
30/07/17, 08:03 - Didier: I can imagine that
30/07/17, 08:04 - Tahnacious: Like... Stating a fact and ooops that's not what they wanted to hear
30/07/17, 08:04 - Tahnacious: Abort, abort!
30/07/17, 08:04 - Tel: Hahahaha!
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: Some infps are more sensitive,some not so much
30/07/17, 08:05 - Tahnacious: True
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: If it's the facts we'll listen
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: Though we don't want to haha
30/07/17, 08:05 - Tahnacious: As long as they don't mind deep conversation then that's good
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: We love them so
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: No worries
30/07/17, 08:05 - Didier: We have a wide range of interests too
30/07/17, 08:06 - Didier: All the best 😉
30/07/17, 08:06 - Tel: Infp might be a good partner actually
30/07/17, 08:06 - Tahnacious: Sounds good, let's just hope that I can live with a male one successfully
30/07/17, 08:06 - Tel: I like the switch of the Ti for Fi, and Fe/Te
30/07/17, 08:06 - Tahnacious: XD
30/07/17, 08:06 - Tahnacious: I'll let you know how I go once I get one in my bedroom
30/07/17, 08:07 - Tahnacious: Watch this space
30/07/17, 08:07 - Tahnacious: Lol
30/07/17, 08:07 - Didier: How to spot Te:critical of the world/humans
30/07/17, 08:07 - Tel: Lol
30/07/17, 08:07 - Didier: How to spot Fi:wants to save everyone's lives
30/07/17, 08:07 - Didier: I think
30/07/17, 08:07 - Tel: Hm, isn't Fi about internal harmony?
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: Yeah
30/07/17, 08:08 - Tel: Fe more the saving type?
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: I didn't state it properly
30/07/17, 08:08 - Tahnacious: Its ok
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: Like always thinking about right or wrong
30/07/17, 08:08 - Tahnacious: As long as Fi is still capable of expressing love
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: Infps can't stand seeing animal abuse too
30/07/17, 08:08 - Tahnacious: Rather than bottling it up
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: We are haha
30/07/17, 08:08 - Tel: True
30/07/17, 08:08 - Didier: We only bottle up if we notice the other doesn't care
30/07/17, 08:09 - Didier: If we feel like we should
30/07/17, 08:09 - Didier: Keep it hidden
30/07/17, 08:09 - Tel: Or, perhaps, being self aware enough to know how they do it and explaining it to us so that we know it when we see it?
30/07/17, 08:09 - Tahnacious: I've known one who doesn't mind bull fighting because of his family background
30/07/17, 08:09 - Didier: I always try to communicate though
30/07/17, 08:09 - Tahnacious: That's good and very healthy
30/07/17, 08:09 - Didier: And I've seen other infps like that too
30/07/17, 08:10 - Tahnacious: What would you say to an infp if they were trying to understand an intp?
30/07/17, 08:10 - Tahnacious: And how the thinking side works
30/07/17, 08:10 - Didier: Introduce them to mbti all over again 😂
30/07/17, 08:10 - Didier: Send them pictures like these
30/07/17, 08:10 - Didier: Wait
30/07/17, 08:11 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 08:11 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 08:11 - Didier: Thinkers tend to follow their head while feelers follow their heart
30/07/17, 08:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 08:12 - Tahnacious: When I follow my heart it lands me in strife

30/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: Yep that is good
30/07/17, 08:13 - Tahnacious: Too much thinking for me, can't do it
30/07/17, 08:13 - Tahnacious: Yeah that situation is ideal
30/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: On the other hand,I notice Fe users bottle up more than Fi
30/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: It's weird actually
30/07/17, 08:13 - Tel: Yea - saving others and not yourself
30/07/17, 08:13 - Tel: Even at your own expense
30/07/17, 08:14 - Tahnacious: Haha yeah, an infp actually noticed I was angry the other day then told me to let it out
30/07/17, 08:14 - Tahnacious: I became aware I was letting Fe seep out

30/07/17, 08:16 - Tahnacious: He's very good
30/07/17, 08:16 - Tel: Trying to be more specific with what you said Didier

30/07/17, 08:17 - Tahnacious: Trivia:
30/07/17, 08:17 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 08:17 - Tel: I feel like I should give me friend some social time.. Haha. My putting the TV on will only work for so long.. (the INFJ lass is visiting!)
30/07/17, 08:18 - Tahnacious: Good luck ;)

30/07/17, 08:18 - Tahnacious: Awwww
30/07/17, 08:18 - Tel: Haha
30/07/17, 08:18 - Tel: I knew that re goodbye
30/07/17, 08:18 - Tel: Relatively recently tho
30/07/17, 08:18 - Tahnacious: So cute
30/07/17, 08:19 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I thought it was interesting yet relevant
30/07/17, 08:19 - Tahnacious: Enjoy the day :)
30/07/17, 08:19 - Tel: Yup, you too :)
30/07/17, 08:23 - Didier: I would ay that Fi bottles up consciously while Fe bottles up unconsciously?
30/07/17, 08:24 - Tahnacious: Probably, mostly to stop feels spilling on to people you know don't want any of it.
30/07/17, 08:26 - Didier: And I think Fi unconsciously tells u things about themselves while Fe consciously tells u things about themselves
30/07/17, 08:26 - Tahnacious: Which type is more likely to think deeply about ways they can express love for someone?
30/07/17, 08:26 - Didier: That's what I noticed
30/07/17, 08:26 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 08:26 - Tahnacious: I noticed that too
30/07/17, 08:26 - Tahnacious: Like grandiose type of gestures
30/07/17, 08:26 - Tel: Hm, I bottle up consciously. I deliberately shield others and protect them, knowing that it hits on me. Maybe that's a more recent thing, though, that I've become more aware of
30/07/17, 08:27 - Tahnacious: #selfawareness
30/07/17, 08:27 - Tel: Hm, fair enough
30/07/17, 08:27 - Didier: What I mean is u don't really notice when u r bottling up
30/07/17, 08:27 - Didier: Don't know how to say
30/07/17, 08:27 - Tel: Yea I guess. That'd make more sense for when I was younger

30/07/17, 08:30 - Tahnacious: I sometimes use the nickname Tahnacious-B (last name initial starts with a B)
30/07/17, 08:30 - Tahnacious: I dunno if that counts
30/07/17, 08:31 - Didier: Hmm that's difficult

30/07/17, 08:31 - Tahnacious: Interesting...
30/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: Is that supposed to be tenacious?
30/07/17, 08:32 - Tahnacious: You don't think they would back out of a crazy proposal idea? Lol
30/07/17, 08:32 - Didier: Try that

30/07/17, 08:42 - Didier: But Idk where to find it wait
30/07/17, 08:42 - Tahnacious: Ok
30/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: INTPs expressed a very strong preference for quality time as their love language of choice.

As a thinking-dominant type, it fits that INTPs prefer to show rather than tell when it comes to love.

To love an INTP, carve out space for them within your schedule. This type prefers one-on-one time to group hangouts, so show them you care by asking them to hang out just the two of you. Take an interest in what they’re interested in and get to know them in a genuine, authentic manner. They’ll appreciate the genuineness of your approach.

To recognize the INTP’s love for you, look at how they’re organizing their priorities. This type isn’t fond of one-on-one socializing for the sake of it, so if they’re setting aside time just for you, it is their way of showing they care. Once you’re closer to an INTP, you may find they’re more comfortable expressing their affection through their less-preferred love languages of words of affirmation or physical touch. If they’re expressing regular acts of verbal and physical affection toward you, you’ll know that they finally feel comfortable around you – and for an INTP, that’s big. Reciprocate their affectionate gestures and words while spending time together, in order to continue to strengthen your relationship. 
30/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: Top love language
30/07/17, 08:45 - Didier: Idk if it's true
30/07/17, 08:45 - Tel: Haha!
30/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: Mine's true at least
30/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: INFPs show a strong preference for quality time as a love language, followed by words of affirmation and physical touch.

Though they experience extremely strong emotions internally, INFPs prefer to show their love by spending time with those they care about and engaging in the activities that they enjoy alongside them.

To show your love to an INFP, set aside time specifically to spend with them. Join them in their favourite activities and learn about whatever it is that they’re passionate about. They will appreciate you taking an interest in the causes and activities that matter to them. Once you know them a little better, let your INFP know explicitly how you feel about them – remind them regularly that you love and care about them deeply, and shower them with small acts of physical affection.

Don’t be afraid to receive love from your INFP in the same way as you give it! Though this type may not be outright in expressing how they feel right off the bat, if they’re putting aside time to spend with you and engaging in activities you enjoy with you, it’s their way of saying, “I’m interested.” As they get to know you better, this type tends to enjoy using written words to express their feelings. They may leave you little notes, poems or letters that let you know how much they love you. Take their words and their shows of physical affection at face value – if an INFP says they love you, they mean it! 
30/07/17, 08:46 - Didier: If I spend a lot of my time with u,it prob means u r important to me
30/07/17, 08:47 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 08:47 - Tahnacious: I'm like that too, gifts and time are my top two
30/07/17, 08:47 - Tahnacious: Words and touch at the bottom for me
30/07/17, 08:47 - Tahnacious: Service is in the middle somewhere
30/07/17, 08:48 - Didier: Quality time and words of affirmation are at the top for me
30/07/17, 08:49 - Tahnacious: I can affirm that you seem like a cool person! Does that count ? XD
30/07/17, 08:50 - Tahnacious: I already spent time here... Bahaha

Also mbti is based on Jungian psychology but it's not really as robust as some of the more professional tests
30/07/17, 15:07 - Janith: And yeah... It's also not a serious personality test. More of a party trick
30/07/17, 15:21 - Tel: DID?
30/07/17, 15:22 - Tel: Hm, just googled it.

30/07/17, 15:25 - Tel: Re robustness; what's the evidence base? I haven't seen one way or another, though am aware it's been researched quite a lot. My current position is that it isn't party trick level and is more useful as an awareness piece - though admittedly haven't researched others as much
30/07/17, 15:29 - Janith: Agree on the awareness point. I don't mean it's completely useless but it definitely shouldn't be considered on the sake level as the professional tests
30/07/17, 15:30 - Tel: Pro tests =?
30/07/17, 16:52 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I'm curious to know which tests are the professional ones.

30/07/17, 23:15 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
30/07/17, 23:20 - Tahnacious: Oh well, it could just be that I'm not in a great mood
30/07/17, 23:35 - Janith: Well... You gotta admit it's definitely more thorough than mbti
30/07/17, 23:39 - Tahnacious: Yeah
30/07/17, 23:39 - Tahnacious: Makes me seem like an asshole though! Lol
30/07/17, 23:39 - Tahnacious: >_<
30/07/17, 23:39 - Tahnacious: Just because I think oh god I honestly don't give a crap about that person... Doesn't mean I won't do something or listen
30/07/17, 23:39 - Tahnacious: Just because I don't enjoy helping people doesn't mean I don't do it regularly
30/07/17, 23:40 - Tahnacious: I feel like I spend more time helping people than helping myself
31/07/17, 00:41 - ‪+351 961 414 659‬: I have a question for you guys. Are you left wing or right wing?
31/07/17, 00:57 - Aaron: Mainly left wing, but I believe in yhe abolishment of ghe seperation between the two. It causes unnecessary friction and forces people to make a choice between two things they both should take to heart
31/07/17, 01:09 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The raw ideologies of either wing sucks
31/07/17, 01:30 - ‪+351 961 414 659‬: What you propose? There are central parties but even in these there are left and right winged factions.. I don't want to these discuss politics, I'm just curiose about the  intp politic mind
31/07/17, 02:04 - Maureen: liberal left wing
31/07/17, 02:06 - Janith: Apolitical
31/07/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: This
31/07/17, 02:07 - Janith: Also... RICK AND MORTY SEASON 3 EPISODE 2 HAS BEEN AIRED!!!
31/07/17, 02:08 - FABIO: Omg
31/07/17, 02:08 - FABIO: Ong
31/07/17, 02:08 - FABIO: Omg
31/07/17, 02:08 - Tahnacious: EPISODE 3 OF GAME OF THRONES SEASON 7 HAS BEEN AIRED!!!!
31/07/17, 02:08 - Tahnacious: Lol
31/07/17, 02:09 - Janith: Still trying to get on at episode one 😂
31/07/17, 02:12 - FABIO: Im watching got with girlfriend. Still on season 5
31/07/17, 02:20 - Tel: 🤘🏻
31/07/17, 02:20 - Tel: I'm about to watch it
31/07/17, 02:21 - Tel: Progressive rather than l/r
31/07/17, 02:23 - Tel: Will look at this week. Have heard of big 5 before, though not done test.
31/07/17, 02:23 - Tel: There's also mbti step 2, though I haven't taken it
31/07/17, 02:25 - Janith: Step 2?
31/07/17, 02:26 - Janith: I'm lacking a girlfriend to watch it with so I don't think I'll be watching any time soon 😂
31/07/17, 02:45 - FABIO: 😂😂😂😂
31/07/17, 03:00 - Janith: @554691068741 did you watch it?
31/07/17, 03:00 - Janith: It's glorious 😍😍😍
31/07/17, 03:04 - Infected: I have to watch both of those episodes. By myself.
31/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Not yet
31/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Tomorrow
31/07/17, 03:08 - FABIO: Hahahaha
31/07/17, 03:08 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 03:16 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 03:17 - Janith: I doubt it's a fear of socializing though
31/07/17, 03:17 - Janith: Do you have social anxiety or something @15015198024?
31/07/17, 03:18 - Infected: That's what I'm told. I think I just don't like people.
31/07/17, 03:20 - Janith: Well considering you can converse with us just fine I think you're just not fond of talking to people that much
31/07/17, 03:20 - Janith: I know an INTP who has social anxiety and she only managed one response in her time here
31/07/17, 03:22 - Infected: You people being real is more of an abstract thought to me.
31/07/17, 03:26 - Infected: And you're probably right. My old therapist said I had social anxiety bc I have a bad reaction to people but I think I just like being alone.
31/07/17, 03:27 - Janith: I've toyed with that idea too. Fun to play around with for now. Less so if the Internet gets flooded with intelligent AIs😂
31/07/17, 03:28 - Infected: I don't see intelligent a.i.'s as less real than human beings communicating online.
31/07/17, 03:32 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 03:41 - Janith: Dammit.. Imitated :(
31/07/17, 03:42 - Infected: You could get real ones, probably but for fire pit purposes, charcoal skulls do the trick.
31/07/17, 03:43 - Janith: Good point
31/07/17, 03:44 - Infected: Rewatched the matrix trilogy today. The movies leave a bit to be desired but the theory is one I find interesting.
31/07/17, 03:46 - Tel: Yea, it's a more in depth version of mbti
31/07/17, 03:47 - Tel: Each dichotomy has 4 additional layers
31/07/17, 03:47 - Tel: I haven't done it though, so less experienced in it
31/07/17, 03:48 - Tel: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBTI_Step_II
31/07/17, 03:54 - Infected: Not really wanting to pay 100 bucks for a personality test.
31/07/17, 03:57 - Tel: No, indeed. Though the questionnaires are only as good as the knowledge used to guide you through them
31/07/17, 03:58 - Tel: The mbti practitioners help guide you through it in ways that the indicator will cannot
31/07/17, 04:04 - FABIO: im
31/07/17, 04:04 - FABIO: adicted
31/07/17, 04:04 - FABIO: to cs
31/07/17, 04:04 - FABIO: never tougth i would say that
31/07/17, 04:04 - FABIO: cs go
31/07/17, 04:25 - Janith: Weren't you addicted to PUBG a couple of days ago?
31/07/17, 04:26 - FABIO: Hahaha
31/07/17, 04:26 - FABIO: Yes
31/07/17, 04:26 - FABIO: Im on both now
31/07/17, 04:27 - Janith: Make sure you stay away from other games for a while then 😂
31/07/17, 04:27 - FABIO: Hahahha
31/07/17, 04:27 - FABIO: Good point
31/07/17, 04:28 - FABIO: Im winning
31/07/17, 04:28 - FABIO: Its addictive
31/07/17, 04:28 - FABIO: Usually the best player of the round...
31/07/17, 04:28 - Janith: Dopamine is supposed to be addictive
31/07/17, 04:29 - Janith: I stay away from those two games because of that 😂
31/07/17, 04:29 - FABIO: Smart move
31/07/17, 04:49 - Tahnacious: I kind of wish people could give themselves love injections and it not be illegal
31/07/17, 04:51 - Tahnacious: Dopamine + serotonin + oxytocin
31/07/17, 04:55 - Infected: I've read that you can get the same effect by eating certain foods.
31/07/17, 05:11 - Tahnacious: But I'm on a strict diet :(
31/07/17, 05:12 - Tahnacious: I wanna overdose on happy chemicals and sit alone in my house all day practically purring and holding my pillow
31/07/17, 06:38 - Tel: Hm, I'm not a huge fan. Seems much less theoretically based than mbti. The outputs may be useful, but seemingly for a much different purpose than the mbti
31/07/17, 06:43 - Tel: Though it's not like mbti isn't without its statistical problems.
31/07/17, 06:49 - Tel: I find that it (mbti) provides a good framework for discussions / analysis though. Criticisms seem largely levied at the indicator itself, too, rather than the combination of the indicator and personalised walk through undertaken by a practitioner
31/07/17, 07:50 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 07:50 - Tel: Haha. Boasting
31/07/17, 07:50 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Neutral
31/07/17, 07:51 - Tel: Tooting your own horn = telling others how good you are

31/07/17, 08:10 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 08:10 - Tel: How do you mean?
31/07/17, 08:11 - Tel: 'you have something nice to say about everyone'
31/07/17, 08:11 - Didier: Ok haha
31/07/17, 08:11 - Tel: :)
31/07/17, 08:11 - Didier: I was afraid I was wrong lol
31/07/17, 08:11 - Tel: Haha. English has many nuances I guess
31/07/17, 08:11 - Tel: One of the critiques of the big 5 test is that it doesn't translate well into all languages
31/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: True
31/07/17, 08:13 - Didier: That's why English is easy to pick up,difficult to master
31/07/17, 08:13 - Tel: Is it actually easy to pick up? I ask as I wouldn't know :p
31/07/17, 08:14 - Tel: Big 5 seeks useful as a snapshot into 'current you' and to help with psychoanalysis I think.. Nice links to moods and mental health.

31/07/17, 08:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm friends with my ex too but I might be a sociopath

31/07/17, 08:25 - Tel: I've analysed myself against it before and decided against relatively easily when seeing the clinical terms
31/07/17, 08:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I can't really decide
31/07/17, 08:26 - Tel: Do you feel bad when you do something wrong to someone else?
31/07/17, 08:26 - Tel: Ie do you feel remorse / guilt?
31/07/17, 08:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Depends on the ulterior purpose
31/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If it needs to be done, no remorse
31/07/17, 08:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: At all

31/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well tbh if there's no legit purpose behind it, who's jobless enough to hurt others
31/07/17, 08:28 - Tel: Your description above could be a typical Te response
31/07/17, 08:28 - Didier: In that case,I love a sociopath like u
31/07/17, 08:28 - Didier: My favourite character,I believe,might be sociopath too 😀
31/07/17, 08:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haha 😄
31/07/17, 08:29 - Tel: That could also be a T response.. The point is, would you feel remorse if you did? :)
31/07/17, 08:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If it wasn't called for, yeah
31/07/17, 08:29 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I would
31/07/17, 08:30 - Didier: What qualifies as superficial charm though?
31/07/17, 08:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Being charming in order to seduce or manipulate

31/07/17, 08:54 - Janith: Now that's an interesting situation. The substances themselves aren't really illegal but they're not being used as recreational drugs either

31/07/17, 10:00 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: Is the matrix the illusion or the real world?

31/07/17, 10:01 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬: I just gg it, it s the illusion
31/07/17, 10:01 - Amin: Yea
31/07/17, 10:01 - Amin: Matrix 2
31/07/17, 10:10 - Infected: I have all but 2 of these traits.
31/07/17, 10:20 - Janith: I knew there was a reason I liked you 😂
31/07/17, 10:20 - Infected: I wasn't aware.
31/07/17, 10:22 - Janith: Now you know. Always nice to meet a fellow sociopath
31/07/17, 10:27 - Infected: Online, anyway.
31/07/17, 11:12 - Amin: Do I even need to try this? 😂
31/07/17, 11:14 - Infected: It's only my opinion but I think a lot of intp/j's would identify with most of the signifiers for sociopathy.
31/07/17, 11:14 - Amin: 😂😂
31/07/17, 11:15 - Amin: How are you infected? Mushroom
31/07/17, 11:15 - Tel: I think so too
31/07/17, 11:15 - Amin: I mean what is your infection?
31/07/17, 11:15 - Infected: I'm well. Grumpy, per the norm.
31/07/17, 11:15 - Tel: I've often considered it, but have determined against.
31/07/17, 11:15 - Infected: My infection would probably be existential nihilism.
31/07/17, 11:16 - Amin: Very nice infection, some have herpes
31/07/17, 11:17 - Infected: I don't let dirty things near my orifices.
31/07/17, 11:18 - Amin: Yeah, thats why you have the infection you think you have
31/07/17, 11:18 - Amin: What was it again?
31/07/17, 11:19 - Infected: Don't be droll, Amin.
31/07/17, 11:20 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 11:21 - Amin: Am I ?
31/07/17, 11:21 - Amin: I suggest creating new personalities 😂
31/07/17, 11:22 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 11:22 - Infected: I have several partial ones.
31/07/17, 11:22 - Amin: No, am I amin?
31/07/17, 11:22 - Amin: 😂😂
31/07/17, 11:23 - Amin: I suggest an estj
31/07/17, 11:24 - Amin: Stop thinking
31/07/17, 11:24 - Amin: And bullshit
31/07/17, 11:24 - Amin: And start doing stuff
31/07/17, 11:24 - Janith: I consider myself an absurdist😊
31/07/17, 11:25 - Infected: My bullshit quota is relegated to streaming video and reading non factual books.
31/07/17, 11:25 - Infected: Not very different, really.
31/07/17, 11:26 - Amin: Try finance
31/07/17, 11:26 - Janith: Dammit if we weren't half a world apart we'd be epic friends
31/07/17, 11:26 - Infected: I'd rather not.
31/07/17, 11:27 - Janith: Out of curiosity, why not?
31/07/17, 11:27 - Infected: If we were within close proximity, I highly doubt we would speak.
31/07/17, 11:28 - Infected: Boring. I'm not a numbers person. I don't like strict rules.
31/07/17, 11:28 - Janith: Nah. I'm actually pretty good at approaching people I find interesting. To the point that some have even mistaken me for an extrovert
31/07/17, 11:29 - Janith: I like numbers. Though I must admit I'm not a finance person either. It never felt alive to me. I prefer the natural sciences
31/07/17, 11:30 - Infected: I am in some aspects. Digital communication I'd no problem for me. I'm somewhat autistic in person.
31/07/17, 11:31 - Infected: I like the abstract concepts based on mathematics but not the equations themselves. I like to think without constraints on what the outcome should be.
31/07/17, 11:31 - Janith: As long as you're up for debates and other related stuff I don't really care 😊
31/07/17, 11:32 - Janith: But isn't it hard to make predictions about outcomes without those constraints?
31/07/17, 11:33 - Infected: I'm more philosophical than a typical intp. This has led people to believe I'm mistyped. On the contrary, I have just developed my functions differently than others.
31/07/17, 11:35 - Janith: What type do they believe you are?
31/07/17, 11:35 - Janith: And aren't most INTPs pretty philosophical?
31/07/17, 11:39 - Infected: Philosophical within limits, from what I have observed. Thought is a study with an inevitable outcome based on parameters set prior to the study. I.e. the standard scientific method. You think of a theory and test that theory. It either comes true or doesn't which is studied more, adjusting for the distinct variables. A. happened but B. did not and it effected C. in this manner. Change B. to effect outcome of C.
31/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: You know what i have observed?
31/07/17, 11:40 - FABIO: I found more intps. In my 3d printing group. Than here
31/07/17, 11:41 - FABIO: 👌🏻
31/07/17, 11:41 - Infected: How literal is your definition of intp?
31/07/17, 11:42 - Janith: How many people are in your 3d printing group?
31/07/17, 11:43 - FABIO: Thats a point hahahaha
31/07/17, 11:43 - FABIO: 119
31/07/17, 11:43 - Tel: Hm, isn't that the def of an INTJ? Re think of theory + test.. 

INTP is more think of theory, consider solved, move to next
31/07/17, 11:43 - Didier: Wow
31/07/17, 11:44 - Didier: I wanna try 3d printing but
31/07/17, 11:44 - Didier: Probably no chance til when I'm older
31/07/17, 11:44 - Didier: :/
31/07/17, 11:45 - Janith: Well considering sheer numbers you could be right but the INTP concentration is definitely higher here
31/07/17, 11:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Anyone else love pissing their opponents off to the point they begin to shut down and abuse? 😂
31/07/17, 11:46 - Infected: The majority of top tier intp I have noticed function similarly to how I have mentioned. I have also noticed that low tier intp individuals, such as myself, aren't largely considered "real intp's"
31/07/17, 11:48 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 11:48 - Infected: Not typically. I don't enjoy many games, though.
31/07/17, 11:50 - Infected: The Leming mentality of the uber religious.
31/07/17, 11:52 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They're ridiculous lmao
31/07/17, 11:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I do, but chess and Muay Thai the only competitive ones
31/07/17, 11:53 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: So a lot of scope for that happening with me. It's fun
31/07/17, 11:54 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's like if you look close enough, you might find steam evolving from their ears
31/07/17, 11:56 - Infected: I find eliciting emotional reactions from people to be quite uncomfortable and unintentional.
31/07/17, 11:56 - Amin: Very lame
31/07/17, 11:56 - Infected: You are but what am I?
31/07/17, 11:56 - Amin: Misjudge
31/07/17, 11:57 - Janith: It's a no from me. I find it pointless and a waste of effort. 
I prefer a clean victory or defeat
31/07/17, 11:57 - Amin: Huh? Im not butt
31/07/17, 11:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I love doing that. Primarily to manipulate them and throw them off using their own dumbness
31/07/17, 11:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not pointless at all. Just that you don't see it
31/07/17, 11:57 - Infected: You are what you eat.

31/07/17, 11:57 - Amin: U are what u sniff actually
31/07/17, 11:58 - Amin: 😂😂
31/07/17, 11:58 - Amin: Or what u smoke
31/07/17, 11:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You need to be in constant adversity to get the manipulations @94754191589
31/07/17, 11:58 - Amin: Or what u drink
31/07/17, 11:58 - Janith: The point is an emotional response correct? I don't find it a valid point to illicit an emotion reaction from someone if you can be sure what that reaction will be
31/07/17, 11:58 - Infected: Individual pointlessness. You enjoy the activity but not everyone has a use for it.
31/07/17, 11:59 - Amin: Let me say what janith said easier
31/07/17, 11:59 - Amin: Emotion is bullshit.
31/07/17, 11:59 - Janith: Not bullshit. It's the reason the great majority of the human population keep living
31/07/17, 11:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: The point isn't getting a response at all. The point is throwing the opponent off and enraging them. Funny how that could bring an entire man down
31/07/17, 12:00 - Infected: Elicit. Illicit is an unscrupulous activity. Which, in this case, might be apropos depending on your individual idea of the concept.
31/07/17, 12:00 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's a legit manoeuver. Whether one is interested in it or not
31/07/17, 12:00 - Amin: Bullshit😂😂
31/07/17, 12:00 - Infected: Brb
31/07/17, 12:00 - Janith: Oh shit. My bad. I meant elicit but my hands disagreed with me 😂
31/07/17, 12:01 - Amin: Ok
31/07/17, 12:01 - Janith: Ah okay. The tactical maneuver
31/07/17, 12:01 - Amin: What does boob stands for?
31/07/17, 12:01 - Janith: Yeah I like that strategy sometimes
31/07/17, 12:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Breasts oh oh breasts?
31/07/17, 12:02 - Amin: Maybe 😂😂😂
31/07/17, 12:02 - Janith: Especially in strategy games
31/07/17, 12:02 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yep. Works wonders
31/07/17, 12:02 - Amin: Game theory
31/07/17, 12:02 - Amin: Game theory sucks
31/07/17, 12:03 - Janith: Okay?
31/07/17, 12:03 - Amin: John nash was crazy
31/07/17, 12:03 - Amin: But who am I to say that
31/07/17, 12:03 - Amin: 😂
31/07/17, 12:03 - Amin: Aint you talking about strategy?
31/07/17, 12:03 - Amin: Win win equilibruim
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Win-lose
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Game theory
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Prisoners dilema?
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Oh I got u wrong I guess
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Sry for interuption
31/07/17, 12:04 - Amin: Go on
31/07/17, 12:05 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 12:06 - Amin: Janith, God bless you 😇
31/07/17, 12:07 - Janith: Oh I didn't argue on your claim about game theory because you didn't provide a valid point if criticism
31/07/17, 12:07 - Infected: I have a bad habit with words.
31/07/17, 12:08 - Janith: I won't call it bad. I like it when people correct me
31/07/17, 12:08 - Amin: What's ur point then?
31/07/17, 12:08 - Infected: "Psyching" the other player/ team out can be a valid strategy.
31/07/17, 12:09 - Amin: 😂😂😂 mushroom come on
31/07/17, 12:10 - Infected: People are less focused and more apt to make incorrect judgements when in an emotional state. As we know, the majority of the population are feelers.
31/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: Indeed. In strategy games it increases the predictability of an enemy. It works in a certain degree in other genres too
31/07/17, 12:10 - Amin: 😂😂😂
31/07/17, 12:10 - Amin: Ok
31/07/17, 12:10 - Amin: Janith told me to respect u mushroom
31/07/17, 12:10 - Amin: So if he wasnt
31/07/17, 12:10 - Janith: A trait that can be very well manipulated by us thinkers
31/07/17, 12:11 - Amin: I would have told you stop bullshiting your time and start winning
31/07/17, 12:11 - Infected: If he hadn't, you'd still be incorrect.
31/07/17, 12:11 - Amin: Yeah whatever
31/07/17, 12:11 - Amin: I have work to do
31/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: As far as I'm concerned she's more INTP than you are Amin.
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: Bye for now 👋
31/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: You're acting like an STJ 😅
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: Amin? Come on janith, amin is wiped out
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: 😂😂
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: I am an entj
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: Trying to be estj
31/07/17, 12:12 - Janith: New name please. I need to update contact name
31/07/17, 12:12 - Amin: Amin lost
31/07/17, 12:13 - Amin: U can call the kid
31/07/17, 12:13 - Infected: Whether you respect me or not, that doesn't change the validity of what I typed, merely your perception of it.
31/07/17, 12:13 - Amin: Though the real deal is monster
31/07/17, 12:13 - Janith: Nope. Next
31/07/17, 12:13 - Amin: But he does not socialize
31/07/17, 12:13 - Amin: 😂😂😂
31/07/17, 12:13 - Amin: Bye for now 👋
31/07/17, 12:14 - Janith: @15015198024 out of morbid curiosity, how old are you?
31/07/17, 12:14 - Infected: 32
31/07/17, 12:15 - Janith: You look younger actually 😅
31/07/17, 12:15 - Infected: Fat people tend to have a more youthful appearance.
31/07/17, 12:16 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
31/07/17, 12:17 - Amin: That was the most disrespecting thing
31/07/17, 12:17 - Amin: Yeah monster will kill me if I stay more
31/07/17, 12:17 - Amin: But one last thing
31/07/17, 12:17 - Janith: 😂 first off I somehow doubt you're fat 
Second, I wasn't aware of that. Would you happen to know how that happens?
31/07/17, 12:18 - Amin: Mushroom find a husband
31/07/17, 12:18 - Janith: That was disrespectful?
31/07/17, 12:18 - Amin: Like u are too stupid for ur age
31/07/17, 12:18 - Janith: I was merely commenting she looked younger. I thought she was in her early-mid twenties 😂
31/07/17, 12:18 - Infected: Socially contrived niceties are unimportant to me. 

We have more fat on our faces which tends to delay onset of wrinkles.
31/07/17, 12:19 - Infected: I have deemed a life partner to be unnecessary.
31/07/17, 12:19 - Didier: Hahaha
31/07/17, 12:20 - Didier: Sort of already knew
31/07/17, 12:20 - Janith: Not trying to be nice. Just assumed that you were probably exaggerating based on the likelihood that people tend to exaggerate on their being "fat"
31/07/17, 12:21 - Infected: People tend to think I'm older than I am based on my base mannerisms of communication. They see that I look young and then tend to believe I'm trying to act older than my age. These are biases based on the opinions of others and make no difference to me.
31/07/17, 12:21 - Janith: Also thanks. Didn't know that fat delayed the onset of wrinkles.
31/07/17, 12:21 - Didier: Because Amin,I was able to see ur NTJ side.It didn't seem like INTJ though.I heard that u r always partying of the sort so entj?
31/07/17, 12:22 - Janith: Oops missed that. Now I'm glad it took me so long to meet an entj 😂
31/07/17, 12:22 - Amin: Need to go love, talk to you later 😘👋
31/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: Kk byee
31/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: 👋🏻while I eat my cake 🍰
31/07/17, 12:22 - Infected: I don't find "fat" to be an insult.
31/07/17, 12:22 - ‪+352 621 714 571‬ saiu
31/07/17, 12:22 - Didier: 😂
31/07/17, 12:23 - Janith: Me neither. Just a statement. Sorry about the general assumption
31/07/17, 12:23 - Didier: That's good.People use "fat" too much
31/07/17, 12:24 - Janith: Anyways if I remember correctly you said you had a child too? How old is he/she?
31/07/17, 12:24 - Infected: No reason to be apologetic.
31/07/17, 12:24 - Infected: 5
31/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: Nice
31/07/17, 12:25 - Janith: Its been mostly portrayed in a negative light so people presume its an insult most of the time
31/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: Yeah 🤣
31/07/17, 12:25 - Janith: Ah okay. Too young to get q handle on the type
31/07/17, 12:25 - Infected: People use it as an insult to get an emotional reaction.
31/07/17, 12:25 - Didier: Do u think ur child is a thinker or feeler though?
31/07/17, 12:26 - Didier: Yep exactly.To degrade and humiliate other people.
31/07/17, 12:26 - Infected: Indded, his personality so far would seem to be intj-ish but at this stage, it's too early to deem a certainty.
31/07/17, 12:26 - Janith: Would you mind if I inquired about your role as a parent? I've been torn about that myself and I think your perspective would be useful
31/07/17, 12:27 - Infected: In what aspect of parenting are you referring?
31/07/17, 12:27 - Didier: I am curious about that too
31/07/17, 12:27 - Infected: Indeed*
31/07/17, 12:28 - Janith: Well usually a child would need a certain amount of emotional support for healthy growth and I'm wondering how you go about accomplishing that?
31/07/17, 12:28 - Didier: What happens when ur child has emotional needs?What I know is that intj is more emotional than intp.They call intj a cold human,and intp a warm machine.And I know that u said u aren't an "emotional" person
31/07/17, 12:29 - Didier: Haha same Janith 😂
31/07/17, 12:30 - Janith: That's true in my experience. INTPs are better at emulating emotion but have trouble actually feeling it I think
31/07/17, 12:30 - Infected: In a way it was more difficult before he was capable of conversation. I did not understand his tantrums or the reason for them. I did research and learned that at that stage children are mostly emotion and are frustrated at not being able to communicate their desires. I taught him to signal for what he wanted/needed.
31/07/17, 12:31 - Didier: Nice to know that u are communicating effectively
31/07/17, 12:33 - Tel: How would you differentiate an INTJ then?
31/07/17, 12:34 - Didier: Intjs are perfectionists
31/07/17, 12:34 - Didier: What else
31/07/17, 12:34 - Infected: Now that he is 5 and capable of thinking about his communications it is much easier. I have found that the majority of emotional support is simply accepting a person for their inherent qualities and listening to their opinion. I had to develop the ability to process the why and how of another's emotions to be able to effectively parent. I.e. sometimes kids are dicks and that is ok. I tell him I am proud of him anyway. I reiterate to him that he is a smart and capable individual. He gets more externally frustrated than I do so we just talk more about the reason behind his frustration.
31/07/17, 12:35 - Janith: Do you predict more trouble during puberty when hormones have a chance of making their feeling function more chaotic?
31/07/17, 12:35 - Didier: And this
31/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: I'm so glad
31/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: Yes u r right
31/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: I really appreciate parents who put in effort to love their child
31/07/17, 12:36 - Didier: Because my parents aren't like that
31/07/17, 12:37 - Didier: Esfj and infp 🤦🏼‍♀ a disaster to be born
31/07/17, 12:37 - Infected: I do predict some degree of difficulty.
31/07/17, 12:37 - Janith: Fascinating. And I guess you're right. A lot of emotional areas can be dealt with through acceptance without having to get ugly
31/07/17, 12:37 - Didier: The f only heats things up
31/07/17, 12:38 - Didier: No not esfj,but an unhealthy esfj like her
31/07/17, 12:38 - Didier: If not,it would have been fine
31/07/17, 12:39 - Didier: Tell us more about it when u find the chance to :)
31/07/17, 12:39 - Infected: Yes, but this is a grey area. Due to my parenting style, my 5 year old speaks as if he is an adult. He is very opinionated and values his opinion. He is much more independent than other 5 year olds. He considers other children of his age to be ignorant.
31/07/17, 12:39 - Janith: Hopefully he'll turn into an INTx. That should make things easier. 
I wonder what the odds are of an INTx set of parents having a feeling child.
31/07/17, 12:40 - Janith: They usually are. No harm in speaking the truth
31/07/17, 12:40 - Didier: U can check tumblr and u might come across an answer
31/07/17, 12:40 - Tel: That should be a meme..
31/07/17, 12:40 - Infected: My mother is an intx and all of her children are.
31/07/17, 12:40 - Didier: I forgot to give it another look that time...
31/07/17, 12:41 - Janith: True. Tbh I'm not too fond of Tumblr 😂
31/07/17, 12:41 - Janith: Now that sounds promising!
31/07/17, 12:42 - Janith: It's practically a nightmare of mine to end up with a feeler kid if I do procreate
31/07/17, 12:42 - Didier: Wow,u don't see that everywhere.Maybe u wanna teach him about diversity?Cuz thinking of others as ignorant sometimes is because u r kinda ignorant as well
31/07/17, 12:42 - Didier: Talk about difference
31/07/17, 12:43 - Infected: The majority of adults see a child that speaks his/her mind in a forceful manner to be disobedient. I tend to correct other people often that I want my child to be of an independent mind but I do see him having difficulty in school.
31/07/17, 12:44 - Didier: I think it's a nightmare because u probably won't know how to handle it 😂
31/07/17, 12:44 - Didier: I can see it working though
31/07/17, 12:44 - Janith: The majority of adults also believe a dusty old book is good advice on how to live your life
31/07/17, 12:44 - Tel: How would that differentiate, then? If you theorise, test theory, theorist more, test more.. Isn't that looking for perfection? 

As opposed to INTP who would theorise only and then get distracted by something else
31/07/17, 12:45 - Didier: Hmm.I forgot.Wait a min
31/07/17, 12:45 - Infected: He likes to learn and know things. He thinks other kids his age don't know anything. He has a bias against making friends his own age. I have to remind him that he is 5. It is a good idea to at least learn how to get along in a social setting because as he grows, he will have to deal with people. He sees that I do not often get along with people,  although, I do try to be polite so as to set an example.
31/07/17, 12:46 - Janith: Exactly! I'd probably end up looking for an off switch to the emotions
31/07/17, 12:47 - Janith: Well... Shit. That can be quite a tricky situation
31/07/17, 12:47 - Infected: If you want to learn how to get along with feelers, dealing with children is a good crash course. It's extremely difficult but effective.

31/07/17, 12:49 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 12:49 - Janith: Personally I found the theory of group survival to be useful in motivating me to play nice with people. That and the possibility that knowing them might be beneficial down the line
31/07/17, 12:49 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 12:50 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 12:50 - Didier: There it is
31/07/17, 12:50 - Janith: My Fe takes over when I'm dealing with children so I can take care of them pretty well for short periods. A long term commitment like having a child would be nearly impossible though unless the mother had a strong feeling function
31/07/17, 12:51 - Didier: They are total opposite
31/07/17, 12:51 - Didier: S
31/07/17, 12:51 - Didier: That's why intp and intj fight
31/07/17, 12:51 - Infected: I'm a single mother. I wouldn't say that I'm the best parent in the world but I'm not unsuccessful at it.
31/07/17, 12:52 - Tel: Hm, don't think I've knowingly come across many INTJs, or any
31/07/17, 12:52 - Janith: @447903370497 and @6582280971 I find your pictures to be an interesting representation of the difference between INTP and INFP. Didi's is more colorful and artistic while Tel's is more organized and straight to the point
31/07/17, 12:52 - Infected: I used to babysit my nephews quite often and I realized that children are more honest about how they feel and how you make them feel.
31/07/17, 12:53 - Tel: Haha very well noted.
31/07/17, 12:54 - Infected: I like this one.
31/07/17, 12:54 - Janith: I noticed that you considered the idea of a partner unnecessary. I applaud you for the determination. I don't think I would have been able to do something like that. My Fe is quite unstable
31/07/17, 12:54 - Janith: That is something I love about children. Very little bullshit
31/07/17, 12:55 - Spaceexplorer: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 12:55 - Janith: It's a shame that adults don't have that
31/07/17, 12:55 - Didier: Haha yes I agree
31/07/17, 12:56 - Didier: I noticed that u (Janith) and I are very similar
31/07/17, 12:56 - Didier: We even ask the same questions 😂
31/07/17, 12:56 - Didier: Just in a different way
31/07/17, 12:56 - Janith: Me too
31/07/17, 12:56 - Janith: Used to be infp when I was younger
31/07/17, 12:56 - Infected: Trial and error. After I realized that my particular personality made the possibility of finding a life partner less feasible, it was quite easy to depend more upon my solitary nature.
31/07/17, 12:57 - Didier: Maybe u were intp but u seemed infp because u weren't as stable?After all,u were a small child
31/07/17, 12:57 - Spaceexplorer: That would make more sense
31/07/17, 12:57 - Spaceexplorer: Can your type actually change?
31/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: It's possible but unlikely.
31/07/17, 12:58 - Tel: Yea, you're not meant to switch between them either. You simply develop your personality - developing weaknesses / strengths
31/07/17, 12:58 - Infected: I find it very difficult to get most adults to explain their emotional state and why they feel the way they do. Feelers in particular are very evasive about their own emotions even though they think in a more emotional way.

31/07/17, 12:58 - Janith: Well... There goes my hopes for finding a girlfriend like you xD 
Though from a division of labor standpoint wouldn't it be the logical choice to have a partner?
31/07/17, 12:58 - Didier: Exactly!
31/07/17, 12:59 - Didier: I always can't get them to tell me what's wrong
31/07/17, 12:59 - Janith: Odds are I mistyped when I first took the test. I was a little more empathetic back then too
31/07/17, 12:59 - Tel: Fi or Fe? And how do you know they're F rather than T? #devilsadvocate
31/07/17, 13:00 - Didier: Well said
31/07/17, 13:00 - Tel: :)
31/07/17, 13:00 - Infected: When I don't want to talk about my emotional state, it's generally because the other person wouldn't be able to comprehend the conversation. I.e. I enjoy talking about mental health/ mental illness. This makes the majority of people uncomfortable.
31/07/17, 13:00 - Didier: When working adults are stressed,you will notice the T or F
31/07/17, 13:01 - Spaceexplorer: I would think its more possible to switch from entp to intp than infp to intp.. 
Because of the cognitive functions?
31/07/17, 13:01 - Janith: Especially the ones with Fi. INFP and INTJ relationships I've been in were quite frustrating in that regard
31/07/17, 13:01 - Tel: Well, everyone has an F.. Doesn't mean it's dominant or auxiliary though
31/07/17, 13:01 - Tel: I bring my F out at work increasingly regularly, but it's my inferior
31/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: And I notice adults are actually more evasive with it
31/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: Which makes them even more childish
31/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: And I can't handle it
31/07/17, 13:01 - Didier: Evasive with feelings
31/07/17, 13:01 - Janith: It's an amazing subject. Especially considering how complex the brain is
31/07/17, 13:02 - Tel: I'd agree re it making sense re Fi, but less re Fe
31/07/17, 13:02 - Didier: Yep...
31/07/17, 13:02 - Janith: Most definitely. That's why I think it was a mistype. I've always got intp when taking a functions test
31/07/17, 13:02 - Didier: Really 😂
31/07/17, 13:03 - Didier: It's the opposite for me haha
31/07/17, 13:03 - Tel: Can't switch according to the theory.. Though your logic does make sense, if switching is actually possible. Much less of a charge gets
31/07/17, 13:03 - Tel: Much less of a change *
31/07/17, 13:03 - Didier: I think you didn't met the healthy ones
31/07/17, 13:03 - Infected: I wouldn't say that I notice a person's main functions until I have studied them at length, which would generally be after the fact. It's just a trend I notice among people and I recognize that the majority of people are feelers. Therefore, I concluded that generally, feelers are evasive about their own emotional state.
31/07/17, 13:03 - Spaceexplorer: Maybe undeveloped Ti acts out a littke like Fi
31/07/17, 13:03 - Spaceexplorer: 👌
31/07/17, 13:03 - Tel: Yup, 60% I think.
31/07/17, 13:04 - Infected: It's fascinating to read about how mental illness effects the brain and what specific areas of the brain it disturbs. The how and why of it is very interesting.
31/07/17, 13:04 - Janith: You're INFP. Fi goes with Fi so you find it easier. 
But when you operate on Fe it's pretty frustrating when someone feels like you have to guess their emotional state
31/07/17, 13:05 - Tel: Interesting. Haven't noticed re evasiveness. Will have to look for it irl now you mention it
31/07/17, 13:05 - Janith: I noticed that too. It tends to be better with feelers who have a strong thinking function though
31/07/17, 13:05 - Didier: I'm an Fi but I always have to guess for Fe?
31/07/17, 13:06 - Infected: Careful, you'll sometimes find people that won't stop talking about it. I have many more life stories than I cared to.
31/07/17, 13:06 - Infected: Heard*
31/07/17, 13:06 - Tel: Ooo epiphany moment.. Is that why when I ask 'what's up?', knowing that somethings wrong, I don't get a response? 

Oooo that type of person is v annoying. I just thought everyone did that though. Hm.
31/07/17, 13:06 - Janith: Definitely!
31/07/17, 13:06 - Tel: Lol! Warning duly noted.
31/07/17, 13:07 - Didier: As I said before,I noticed Fi consciously bottles up their emotions while Fe unconsciously bottlesup their emotions.Fi unconsciously tells people about themselves.Fe consciously tells people about themselves.
31/07/17, 13:07 - Didier: This means that fe are more careful with what they divulge about themselves
31/07/17, 13:07 - Didier: Also means that Fi can live on this world feeling vety unhappy
31/07/17, 13:08 - Didier: And Fe on this world always feeling that there is a problem
31/07/17, 13:08 - Didier: N they don't know what to do
31/07/17, 13:08 - Janith: I don't mind a lot of those conversations. Gives me a chance to peer into a person's mind. If it's interesting I learn some of their qualities which would be useful in future interactions. 
If not I can zone out while still retaining enough attention to look like I'm fully immersed
31/07/17, 13:08 - Didier: From what I noticed
31/07/17, 13:09 - Infected: I drift mentally quite often when people are speaking, both in innocuous conversation and meaningful conversation.
31/07/17, 13:09 - Janith: This is a pretty accurate observation I think.
31/07/17, 13:09 - Didier: Re evasiveness?
31/07/17, 13:10 - Infected: I have an aversion to overly emotional or talkative individuals.
31/07/17, 13:10 - Janith: Drifting in meaningful conversation is the best part of conversations between xNTPs. The conversations become very dynamic and unpredictable
31/07/17, 13:10 - Janith: It's glorious!
31/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: This being said.Fe and Fi can end up very unhappy.The both bottle up their emotions,just in a different way.
31/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: can both*
31/07/17, 13:11 - Didier: Typos...
31/07/17, 13:12 - Janith: Same here. Overly emotional people tend to trigger the same response in me as eating something sickeningly sweet 😂
31/07/17, 13:12 - Infected: I don't encounter many xntp's in daily life. For some reason, it seems more rare for my area than others.
31/07/17, 13:12 - Didier: Hope u r not averse to me
31/07/17, 13:12 - FABIO: I dont like jerks
31/07/17, 13:12 - FABIO: The rest is fine
31/07/17, 13:12 - Janith: Fortunately I don't meet many talkative people
31/07/17, 13:12 - Janith: Same here. Most NTs I know are online
31/07/17, 13:12 - Didier: I meet too many...
31/07/17, 13:13 - Janith: But that's most NTs :(
31/07/17, 13:13 - Didier: My ears...
31/07/17, 13:13 - Infected: I could be categorized as a jerk due to my indifference to others emotional state.
31/07/17, 13:13 - Janith: Go around with earphones in your ears
31/07/17, 13:13 - Infected: Not as of yet.
31/07/17, 13:13 - Didier: 😂I like this conversation
31/07/17, 13:13 - FABIO: Yes
31/07/17, 13:13 - Didier: Well,it's in school so.I'll try earbuds though
31/07/17, 13:14 - Janith: I never leave home without ny earphones
31/07/17, 13:14 - Janith: @554691068741 I belong in that category too then 😅
31/07/17, 13:14 - Infected: People tend to not respond well when I tell them what they feel is wrong and give them more thought out explanations for what they are complaining about.
31/07/17, 13:15 - FABIO: Yes. Hahahaha
31/07/17, 13:15 - FABIO: Here i have the same problem....
31/07/17, 13:15 - FABIO: But i just dont talk
31/07/17, 13:17 - Infected: I.e. "My boss is such a jerk, he did/ said x to me today"

"Just because that's how you perceive your boss to be doesn't mean that is the reality. Your boss is also human and is under the same stress that you employ. He/she also has superiors that expect x to be done and in a certain manner. You should try to be more understanding of others limitations."
31/07/17, 13:17 - Infected: *glare*
31/07/17, 13:17 - Janith: I can't be bothered to correct most people. There's nearly always something better to do
31/07/17, 13:19 - Janith: I actually never thought of it that way
31/07/17, 13:20 - Janith: Anyway guys I gotta go now. I've reached my upper limit of daily socialization. See you tomorrow
31/07/17, 13:20 - Infected: Same. I only do that when someone exceeds my mental quota for how much they are allowed to complain in my presence.
31/07/17, 13:20 - Infected: 👋🏻
31/07/17, 13:22 - Didier: Same.Bye guys.
31/07/17, 13:22 - Didier: Before that
31/07/17, 13:22 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 13:22 - Didier: Smells like heaven
31/07/17, 13:22 - Infected: Yes, my child wishes to use my phone to play Roblox. 👋🏻
31/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: 😂
31/07/17, 13:23 - Infected: 👍🏻👍🏻
31/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: Mind taking a video next time?
31/07/17, 13:23 - Infected: Of?
31/07/17, 13:23 - Didier: Ur child haha
31/07/17, 13:24 - Infected: He was playing phone games before he was 1. I'm just glad he moved on to more interesting games than temple run and cut the rope.
31/07/17, 13:24 - Didier: That's so cute.Do remember to tell us more :)
31/07/17, 13:25 - Didier: Have a good day
31/07/17, 13:25 - Infected: You, also.
31/07/17, 13:52 - ‪+212 634-331559‬ saiu
31/07/17, 13:59 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: What do you do for work?
31/07/17, 14:00 - Tel: NHS Manager, broadly speaking.
31/07/17, 14:00 - Tel: Specifically, head of outpatients in a London hospital
31/07/17, 14:05 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: NHS?
31/07/17, 14:06 - Tel: National health service
31/07/17, 14:06 - Tel: English healthcare system
31/07/17, 14:07 - Tel: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service
31/07/17, 14:10 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Hah! I also work is social services. How are you developing your F?
31/07/17, 14:16 - Tel: Ah cool! Guess social services in the USA is v different to the UK
31/07/17, 14:18 - Tel: Re dev F - like being aware of my feelings and able to share them immediately, or use them for analysis. Like, adding emotional input with critique (negative or positive) to staff or mgrs, if that makes sense
31/07/17, 14:18 - Tel: N not always as a 'I should say this..', but also because I feel it. Not saying I don't still utilise the manipulative side, but I think it's way more effective when you connect with the Fe. Much more genuine
31/07/17, 14:19 - Tel: N powerful
31/07/17, 14:19 - Tel: Make sense?
31/07/17, 14:33 - Infected: We know that emotion occurs within the brain. It is a firing of synapses and dispersal of specific hormones all culminating in a specific response. People who are emotional thinkers tend to believe that emotion comes from some other part withing themselves, i.e. the heart, the soul, the "gut". Logical thinking allows us to dismiss this sort of thing offhand. In understanding that emotion occurs within the brain, we know the how of emotion. In attempting to understand how feelers actually see and process emotion helps us understand the importance of "why". It helps us relate to and communicate with others more easily.
31/07/17, 14:37 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: This sounds like Fi, individual feelings and values. Is this effective for you when communicating  with other staff? Sounds vulnerable. 

And question about Fe: it's INTP's inferior function. Does that mean we don't value it, or we do and it's just under developed??
31/07/17, 14:39 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: My response was specially to this.
31/07/17, 14:40 - Infected: As related to me, I don't have staff. I had to learn how to fit in with other people so that I wouldn't be institutionalized.
31/07/17, 14:41 - Infected: In general, I think it's not that we don't value our inferior processes, it's a matter of inexperience dealing with them.
31/07/17, 14:42 - Tel: Good point. Hm. Though am using them to effect differences in the world, hence classified as Fe instead
31/07/17, 14:43 - Tel: Hm, now I'm confused :p
31/07/17, 14:43 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: I see, that makes sense. I often seek out friendships with persons with a well developed Fe. Partially out of fascination and partially to observe and learn
31/07/17, 14:46 - Infected: Try using "I feel" instead of "I think" in conversation and see how that goes. In general,  if people think you are connecting to them on an emotional level, communication will go smoother. To an intp, "I think" is actually our way of communicating emotion because emotion is thought to us.
31/07/17, 14:46 - Infected: If that makes sense.
31/07/17, 14:47 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Not my intention :p sorry dear.   
I'm criticized by my clientele as coming across as 'aloof'  and while I LOVE my Ti function, I'm working on becoming more approachable via my Fi, to better influence my work place, Fe.
31/07/17, 14:48 - Tel: Yea, it does
31/07/17, 14:48 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Okay but I dislike saying "I feel.."  it sounds subjective to me.. maybe I should pull it out more though.
31/07/17, 14:49 - Tel: Sounds like what I'm trying to do.
31/07/17, 14:51 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yep.. it's actually my current 'project.'
31/07/17, 14:52 - Tel: How are you effecting it?
31/07/17, 14:54 - Infected: It is but remember, we process things differently than most people. The majority of people want to be understood, it makes them *feel* valued. To us, we are valued by sharing idea and thoughts. Others would rather be understood on an emotional level because they are emotional thinkers. When you approach someone in a way that is relatable to them, you are more likely to get positive results.
31/07/17, 14:57 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: As I mentioned, paying close attention to person's with well developed Fe's and Fi's.  
Lots of nonverbals, nodding, smiling, mirroring body language. 
Also really engaging with the person I'm interacting with is huge. Makes them feel like I care, just by being really present. People love that. Though it's exhausting on my end :P
31/07/17, 14:58 - Infected: I have a problem with the nonverbal cues. I understand them in other people but I ,personally, don't give many nonverbal cues so people believe I am bored, irritated, etc with the exchange.
31/07/17, 15:00 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Precisely, this is why 'charismatic' people exist. I guess it's a matter of, how much do we, as thinkers, care to be understood and valued as thinkers and how much do we care to make others feel comfortable and valued
31/07/17, 15:01 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Hah! I get told I have a bitch face for the same reason
31/07/17, 15:02 - Infected: Same.
31/07/17, 15:04 - Infected: I also had to learn to use emojis and emotes in text conversations. Instead of "That's funny." I had to type "lol" or "😂" because otherwise, people assumed that I was disingenuous
31/07/17, 15:05 - Infected: It seems like it shouldn't be a difficult habit to learn. I just didn't see the point but I realized it made other people feel more comfortable.
31/07/17, 15:21 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yep, same. But then by using emojis and etc, then we're actually being disingenuous. 
Oh well, it's all a big game anyways.
31/07/17, 15:23 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: I would love a close INTP friend I could be really honest with. An ENTP is the closest I have, she's great though too of course
31/07/17, 15:25 - Infected: I find it more satisfying to be who I am and to let the people who don't find me appealing fall off.
31/07/17, 15:27 - Tahnacious: I don't need a person, I just like the happy feelings. These are best felt alone anyway.
31/07/17, 15:28 - Infected: 👍🏻
31/07/17, 15:33 - Tahnacious: I can relate to this
31/07/17, 15:35 - Infected: I believe that the only value humanity has is that which it gives to itself.
31/07/17, 15:39 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Beautiful, actually.
31/07/17, 15:41 - Infected: It's a subject that I ponder on quite frequently.
31/07/17, 15:47 - Tahnacious: If I actually can be bothered to get up and do something I might as well do it right....
31/07/17, 15:50 - Tahnacious: I would be OK with my kid being a feeler if I was still able to find a way to communicate on their wavelength and they were intelligent. My biggest fear is having a stupid kid.
31/07/17, 15:51 - Tahnacious: Who isn't able to take in any info
31/07/17, 15:56 - Tahnacious: I love this ...hahaha
31/07/17, 16:01 - Tahnacious: I find that my infp friends are better at reading my emotional state than I am
31/07/17, 16:03 - Tahnacious: They will say after a long comfortable silence "what's wrong?" It is only then I'll stop my long train of thought and realise I was getting angsty over wherever it had been leading me.
31/07/17, 16:03 - Tahnacious: Then I'll sit and try and analyse the feeling with them 😅
31/07/17, 16:07 - Tahnacious: In the real world it seems everyone is talkative. Strangers greet me and start conversations at random all the time. Sometimes I handle it well but 90% of the time I feel quite uncomfortable.
31/07/17, 16:09 - Tahnacious: Indifference towards emotional state is what I'm most comfortable around. If I'm upset at something and someone talks to me in a rational way over it I click back to reality/Ti mode easily. It is like a brain reset button.
31/07/17, 16:09 - Tahnacious: I don't only use earphones, I use big fuck-off headphones and people still approach me...
31/07/17, 16:10 - Infected: My headphones have kitty ears
31/07/17, 16:11 - Tahnacious: In that situation I'd be like... wait... You're right, sorry I didn't consider that, thank you.
31/07/17, 16:11 - Tahnacious: I love those! Too expensive for me though :(
31/07/17, 16:12 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 16:13 - Infected: I want the elf ear earbuds but I have an aversion to paying over 10 bucks for anything.
31/07/17, 16:14 - Tahnacious: I would say the Fe depends on the individual.
31/07/17, 16:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Has anyone here ever seriously contemplated suicide?
31/07/17, 16:15 - Infected: Tried it a couple times, it wasn't for me.
31/07/17, 16:15 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'd like to know more if you don't mind
31/07/17, 16:16 - Infected: Anything specific?
31/07/17, 16:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: What was going inside your head during then
31/07/17, 16:17 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Going on*
31/07/17, 16:18 - Tahnacious: I use both, although I realise that when I say "I feel" I am actually referring to how "I think", I usually just chuck it in there occasionally to reach out to those of us who are more emotionally structured... Yet that point seems fairly moot in this chat I think I have developed it out of habit, also as another means of saying "I think" without going to such lengths as to say something that may be considered convoluted such as "I hypothesis" etc...
31/07/17, 16:19 - Tahnacious: I read up about non verbal cues, mirroring is something I subconsciously employ in small spurts to try and blend in.
31/07/17, 16:20 - Tahnacious: I am much the same in this sense.
31/07/17, 16:21 - Infected: I have/had emotional issues. The first time I attempted, I was a teenager and didn't know anything about anything. I was depressed, frustrated, etc and didn't know how to channel it/ had no outlet. Second time, drugs. I was on a lot of drugs. They tend to exacerbate mental issues.
31/07/17, 16:22 - Tahnacious: Very nice :D I didn't know you could get stuff like that for so cheap.
31/07/17, 16:22 - Tahnacious: Yes
31/07/17, 16:22 - Tahnacious: OK, I'm all caught up on the chat now
31/07/17, 16:23 - Infected: I've gotten into the habit of saying "I feel" as a way to blend. I mirror and chameleon like nobody's business. I do it so much that it's second nature.
31/07/17, 16:23 - Infected: I love eBay.
31/07/17, 16:25 - Tahnacious: This is the brand I am more familiar with, they're around $150
31/07/17, 16:25 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 16:25 - Infected: Are those the "think geek" ones?
31/07/17, 16:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Lol I can feel what you did in both the situations believe me
31/07/17, 16:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How about you?
31/07/17, 16:26 - Tahnacious: They're "axent wear"
31/07/17, 16:27 - Infected: Interestingly, maybe, I didn't go to the hospital either time. I went to the hospital twice because other people called the police on me. Once a roommate and the other time an ex bf.
31/07/17, 16:27 - Infected: Neat
31/07/17, 16:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I haven't been. I never attempted
31/07/17, 16:27 - Tahnacious: I was in a very bad place as a teenager, I was very lonely, my parents seemed to hate me, I had no real life friends and no true purpose, I had one online friend but that didn't seem to matter in the grand scheme. First I stood out on the window of an 11 story building and just contemplated jumping, I still remember the breeze from up there and looking down
31/07/17, 16:28 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Why does everyone sound like me lmao
31/07/17, 16:28 - Tahnacious: I considered the aftermath, how my body would likely be bloody pulp, how much it would shock onlookers and decided to go against that for everyone else's sake. I did not want a display, I wanted to go silently in to that good night. Hah
31/07/17, 16:28 - Infected: Similar personalities group together. It's a version of herd mentality.
31/07/17, 16:29 - Infected: Relatable
31/07/17, 16:30 - Tahnacious: I had incredibly low self esteem due to bullying throughout school. Both verbal and nonverbal, there was no one I could turn to really.
31/07/17, 16:30 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Didn't drugs help you to keep yourself from doing it @15015198024
31/07/17, 16:30 - Tahnacious: No one to discuss my inner turmoil with, all I knew was everyone hated me, then from that I drew the conclusion that I must be a horrible person... Some disgusting waste of oxygen or something
31/07/17, 16:31 - Tahnacious: Anyway, later on I was raped
31/07/17, 16:31 - Tahnacious: Messed with my mind a little to lose my virginity that way
31/07/17, 16:32 - Tahnacious: It was odd, I had thought I was such scum of the earth that no one would want to touch me but here is this disgusting old man force handling little teenaged me
31/07/17, 16:32 - Tahnacious: Gave me a lot to think about. After that I tried methylated spirits to no avail.
31/07/17, 16:32 - Tahnacious: It burned and tasted yuck. I kept trying to force it down in larger quantities but couldn't bear it.
31/07/17, 16:33 - Tahnacious: After my parents and the police found out what happened to me I was taken to a psychologist and prescribed antidepressants...
31/07/17, 16:34 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think my shit doesn't begin to compare to yours
31/07/17, 16:34 - Infected: In a way. I used drugs as a crutch to silence/pacify my inner diatribe and as a distraction. Over time the numbness that you get from the effect can become overwhelming in and of itself and you want to exist in that state which can lead to overdosing, which is what I did. It wasn't accidental nor was it on purpose. I wanted to get as deep into that feeling of not feeling as much as possible and I took too many pills. My bodies self preservation reflex kicked in at some point and I woke up some time later with my head in the toilet.
31/07/17, 16:34 - Tahnacious: I wasn't sure if they made me feel better. One day I took 23 of them at once. Mostly to see if it had any real effect on me, I knew it wouldn't kill me but secretly hoped it did
31/07/17, 16:34 - Infected: Relatable
31/07/17, 16:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I just smoke till I numb the fuck out
31/07/17, 16:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: However much it takes
31/07/17, 16:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Somehow always end up finding some
31/07/17, 16:35 - Infected: Weed is helpful to my particular condition.
31/07/17, 16:35 - Tahnacious: I was always against drugs until this year where I just stopped caring at all
31/07/17, 16:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I used to be against it too. Until I got some sense forced into my head
31/07/17, 16:36 - Tahnacious: Last attempt was to starve myself to death. I buried myself
31/07/17, 16:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I realise how many people are alive on that stuff now
31/07/17, 16:37 - Infected: I wasn't for or against but I noticed how other people behaved on hardcore drugs, stealing, hurting people etc.
31/07/17, 16:37 - Tahnacious: But I grew up on a farm, after about 5 hours of sitting under the dirt hoping to slowly waste away with only my face above ground there was a stampede of my mums horses.
31/07/17, 16:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I feel like a lil boy whining about small stuff now after this
31/07/17, 16:38 - Infected: I decided that I didn't have a problem because I worked 80+ hour weeks to pay for my habits.
31/07/17, 16:38 - Tahnacious: For some reason my instincts triggered and I forced myself out because there were hooves slamming either side of my face
31/07/17, 16:38 - Tahnacious: I couldn't just sit still... Ugh I hayed myself for that
31/07/17, 16:38 - Tahnacious: *hated
31/07/17, 16:39 - Tahnacious: Trust me, there are people who had it worse than I. This is not a competition, merely a discussion.
31/07/17, 16:39 - Infected: We are glad you're here, though.
31/07/17, 16:39 - Tahnacious: Appreciate the sentiment
31/07/17, 16:40 - Tahnacious: After 8 years I managed to come off the antidepressants. Still feel depressed just not suicidal :)
31/07/17, 16:40 - Infected: That's why I typically don't talk about my experiences.
31/07/17, 16:40 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well I didn't really mean it as a competition. Sometimes talking to other people about stuff opens your brain and makes it aware of where you would've fucked up if you didn't talk about it
31/07/17, 16:41 - Tahnacious: For me it is a matter of being enough years ago that I am able to have a lovely chat about it without involving my emotions hah.
31/07/17, 16:42 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm pretty sure there are several times in my life I could've fucked up much worse 😅
31/07/17, 16:42 - Infected: It's not that I get emotional about it. It's uncomfortable for me to communicate with people and I just don't typically like talking about myself. I don't like the superficial "poor you" fake sympathy comments either.
31/07/17, 16:42 - Tahnacious: It wasn't until after I finished high school and got in my first relationship that I realised I'm not some ugly shitstain on society, I just merely exist.
31/07/17, 16:42 - Infected: Also, it makes other people uncomfortable.
31/07/17, 16:43 - Tahnacious: This
31/07/17, 16:43 - Infected: Same
31/07/17, 16:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I'm at that point rn
31/07/17, 16:43 - Tahnacious: I figured I was safe to mention it here because 
1. INTPs
2. analysis could be fun
3. I was asked directly
31/07/17, 16:44 - Infected: At some point, I just stopped giving a shit, tbh. I am the person that I am.
31/07/17, 16:44 - Infected: This.
31/07/17, 16:44 - Tahnacious: Yeah pretty much
31/07/17, 16:44 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well thanks for sharing it with me
31/07/17, 16:45 - Infected: I don't think I'm the worst person on Earth. I'm not amazing. I do know that I don't fit in but I'm pretty solitary so that isn't an issue.
31/07/17, 16:48 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: My thoughts every time I open this chat.
31/07/17, 16:48 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haha
31/07/17, 16:49 - Tahnacious: Yeah, there are far too many people in the world for me to be the worst one :P I have better chances at winning the lottery
31/07/17, 16:50 - Tahnacious: Besides I don't murder, etc. That has to give me bonus points somewhere.
31/07/17, 16:51 - Infected: I've never intentionally murdered anyone, for sure. I like animals. I'm not a terrorist. I'm not exactly up for a Nobel prize either.
31/07/17, 16:51 - Arne: No
31/07/17, 16:51 - Tahnacious: At least I tried :) lol
31/07/17, 16:51 - Arne: It's not about the things you don't do, it's about the things you do
31/07/17, 16:52 - Tahnacious: I don't do anything constructive whatsoever
31/07/17, 16:52 - Infected: My belief has always been that you don't get bonus points for doing what you should already be doing. I.e. murder isn't exactly common sense.
31/07/17, 16:52 - Infected: Same.
31/07/17, 16:53 - Tahnacious: It was mostly a joke but  I make bad jokes.
31/07/17, 16:53 - Arne: Same
31/07/17, 16:54 - Infected: I'm not good with jokes. I tend to take things too literally. I do see the humor in certain situations, though.
31/07/17, 16:55 - Tahnacious: I usually walk around absorbed in my little mind bubble not noticing what's around me. Someone could be impaled on a fence and asking for assistance, chances are I wouldn't notice and therefore wouldn't help.
31/07/17, 16:55 - Infected: Relatable
31/07/17, 16:56 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: This works for you?? I become more and more engrossed in my own thoughts. I can only really smoke when I'm drinking,  or if it's a spliff
31/07/17, 16:56 - Tahnacious: It is not that I am a bad person, it is that I'm not the most useful person :)
31/07/17, 16:56 - Tahnacious: I tried smoking, doesn't work for me. Numbs my train of thought and makes it feel airy and distant, which kind of stresses me out a little
31/07/17, 16:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah I use spliffs too. And play this playlist I composed for it
31/07/17, 16:57 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And I'm like the coolest person on earth then
31/07/17, 16:57 - Infected: Same. I don't find the necessity of being useful to other people.
31/07/17, 16:57 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Show me.
31/07/17, 16:57 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Please.
31/07/17, 16:58 - Infected: ^^
31/07/17, 16:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sure just a min
31/07/17, 16:58 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's on the other phone
31/07/17, 16:58 - Tahnacious: It isn't so much out of lack of necessity, perhaps I would help but I am far too detached from reality.
31/07/17, 16:59 - Infected: I tend to have paranoid delusions. The marijuanas help me think more abstractly and get out it.
31/07/17, 16:59 - Infected: Of*
31/07/17, 16:59 - Tahnacious: In small doses it makes me laugh at everything
31/07/17, 16:59 - Tahnacious: And eat a lot
31/07/17, 17:00 - Infected: I find that I'm more relaxed around other people when I smoke. It's not something I do often but it does seem to help.
31/07/17, 17:01 - Tahnacious: One time I fell to the floor laughing then after a minute I recovered, went to stand and hit my head, knocking me to the floor again which caused another bout of laughter.
31/07/17, 17:01 - Infected: Adorable
31/07/17, 17:01 - Tahnacious: Almost like something from a comedy hah
31/07/17, 17:02 - Infected: Yes but better because it's authentic.
31/07/17, 17:02 - Tahnacious: I can agree with that. Still, I felt very dumb at the time!
31/07/17, 17:02 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Interesting, i wish I had the same experience. I just begin to feel paranoid and my thoughts become unmanageable.
31/07/17, 17:03 - Tahnacious: I am so lacking in S sometimes it hurts... Literally.
31/07/17, 17:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 17:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 17:03 - Infected: Comedies are over exaggerations of real quirks. I find actual people's awkwardness to be more enjoyable.
31/07/17, 17:03 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I keep changing it from time to time though
31/07/17, 17:03 - Tahnacious: I'm more like this
31/07/17, 17:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: @14063816864 ^^
31/07/17, 17:04 - Infected: Muse 👍🏻
31/07/17, 17:04 - Tahnacious: Plenty of authentic awkwardness here :)
31/07/17, 17:04 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: They're awesome
31/07/17, 17:04 - Tahnacious: I like muse.
31/07/17, 17:04 - Infected: Let's be besties.
31/07/17, 17:04 - Tahnacious: Anyone listen to Periphery?
31/07/17, 17:05 - Tahnacious: I got recommended it by another INTP and I like em
31/07/17, 17:05 - Infected: Maybe but probably not.
31/07/17, 17:05 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I tried one of theirs but didn't like it for some reason
31/07/17, 17:05 - Tahnacious: This can be arranged haha. Although we are at times very different INTPs I do very much appreciate the company.
31/07/17, 17:06 - Tahnacious: That's OK, they have a few different styles and it's not one for all.
31/07/17, 17:06 - Infected: I listen to a lot of folk, blues, and classic rock.
31/07/17, 17:06 - Tahnacious: I listen to most things except for rap/hiphop etc
31/07/17, 17:07 - Infected: I listen to everything but those genres are my favorites, I suppose.
31/07/17, 17:07 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I guess my "core" is rock, punk and alternative.
31/07/17, 17:08 - Tahnacious: And some electronic for fun
31/07/17, 17:13 - Infected: I like Hopsin
31/07/17, 17:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Try Grimes - life in the vivid dream
31/07/17, 17:14 - Infected: When it comes to rap/ hip hop, I mostly listen to the stuff that came out when I was a kid.
31/07/17, 17:14 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: https://youtu.be/jzeQTMYhZds
31/07/17, 17:19 - Tahnacious: Don't mind it
31/07/17, 17:22 - Infected: Don't care for it. I liked it in the beginning then her voice and the instrumentals sounded the same and it became kind of muddy to me.
31/07/17, 17:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well yeah her voice does take some getting used to
31/07/17, 17:22 - Arne: https://youtu.be/Wof6pvlfvKY
31/07/17, 17:23 - Infected: I think she would sound better with fewer instruments to clash with her voice. Maybe just an acoustic or harp/violin. My opinion, though.
31/07/17, 17:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well her music minus her voice is pretty awesome as well
31/07/17, 17:25 - Infected: 👍🏻
31/07/17, 17:26 - Arne: I like the rap
31/07/17, 17:26 - Infected: Does she produce her own music?
31/07/17, 17:27 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Thank you!! I love listening to others  music, such a good way to map out their mind.
31/07/17, 17:29 - Infected: Give this a try.

https://youtu.be/SY1V0Y7hscw
31/07/17, 17:30 - Arne: I can't rn, but I'll give it a star
31/07/17, 17:33 - Infected: 👍🏻
31/07/17, 17:34 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Good and melancholy 👌🏼
31/07/17, 17:35 - Infected: I find that listening to music helps me to better understand human emotion.
31/07/17, 17:35 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/VK9qfVQ4Z04 her voice gets me
31/07/17, 17:36 - Tel: 🤘🏻🤘🏻 Fecking amazing live, too. Saw them at Glastonbury last year. Awesome
31/07/17, 17:37 - Tahnacious: I made a playlist for an INFP once, I struggled but every song was "feelsy"
31/07/17, 17:38 - Tahnacious: I enjoy this
31/07/17, 17:38 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Sames. My own and well as others.
31/07/17, 17:38 - Infected: Beautiful
31/07/17, 17:39 - FABIO: Nice
31/07/17, 17:41 - Infected: Kind of reminded me of this.

https://youtu.be/JiDnB-CrrNs

A favorite of mine.
31/07/17, 17:41 - FABIO: https://youtu.be/3UET1wP8y4g

My favorite
31/07/17, 17:41 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Oooo good one
31/07/17, 17:42 - Tahnacious: Oh I love that song too
31/07/17, 17:43 - Tahnacious: I used to imagine my own music video to it... Hah
31/07/17, 17:43 - Arne: The last goodbye, from the hobbit I like
31/07/17, 17:44 - Tahnacious: I like the misty mountain song thing
31/07/17, 17:45 - FABIO: Hahaha also good
31/07/17, 17:45 - Arne: Or I see fire - Ed sheeran
31/07/17, 17:46 - FABIO: Too much gay for me
31/07/17, 17:47 - FABIO: https://youtu.be/u9Dg-g7t2l4

This man voice
31/07/17, 17:47 - FABIO: Deep as fuck
31/07/17, 17:48 - Infected: I like both of these.
31/07/17, 17:48 - Arne: I can listen rn, but is it like George Ezra?
31/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/DOQsYk8cbnE then there's this ^^ lol
31/07/17, 17:48 - Arne: I cant"
31/07/17, 17:48 - Infected: Love this cover.
31/07/17, 17:48 - FABIO: He is the best
31/07/17, 17:48 - Tahnacious: Love disturbed and love this song
31/07/17, 17:48 - Infected: Try this one. 

https://youtu.be/uBx76N9tudQ
31/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: I don't mind Ed sheeran either
31/07/17, 17:49 - Arne: Another star infected (:
31/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: I love having YouTube red haha.. Can chat and listen at the same time :)
31/07/17, 17:49 - Tahnacious: First verse already like it
31/07/17, 17:50 - Arne: Huh, isn't that normal at just YouTube?
31/07/17, 17:50 - Tahnacious: No, normal YouTube stops playing when you switch tabs
31/07/17, 17:50 - Infected: The inflections in the singers voice bothers me, idky.
31/07/17, 17:51 - Infected: The Steeldrivers are another favorite of mine.
31/07/17, 17:51 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/oQfAZVsz6KM enjoy some Aussie music :)
31/07/17, 17:51 - Infected: Blocked in u.s. lol
31/07/17, 17:52 - Arne: Oh that kind of chat. I thought something different. But there are apps (android) where you can do that, I even can play two songs at the same time lal
31/07/17, 17:52 - Tahnacious: Nooooo so lame D: I'll try and find another
31/07/17, 17:52 - Infected: 👍🏻
31/07/17, 17:53 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/GJ-m4AVOKiU what about this one?
31/07/17, 17:54 - Infected: Nope lol I'll check, jas
31/07/17, 17:54 - Tahnacious: Haha
31/07/17, 17:54 - Tahnacious: Oh well, guess Aussie music isn't allowed in USA hah
31/07/17, 17:55 - Infected: I like it.
31/07/17, 17:55 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/Urtiyp-G6jY
31/07/17, 17:55 - Tahnacious: This one also
31/07/17, 17:56 - Tahnacious: Traditional Australian song about war which is a hard concept for me to grasp so the song is interesting to me
31/07/17, 17:58 - Arne: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 17:59 - Infected: Check this out if you haven't heard it.

https://youtu.be/zYJ1IrxDLPM
31/07/17, 18:00 - Infected: A good song about war is 
The Steeldrivers - Sticks that made thunder
31/07/17, 18:01 - Infected: This is good
31/07/17, 18:02 - Arne: Centuries - fallout boy, not really about war but its awesome
31/07/17, 18:10 - Infected: Do you like Queens of the stone age, Toadies and all them?
31/07/17, 18:12 - Arne: Never heard of
31/07/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: I like fallout boy hah
31/07/17, 18:13 - Tahnacious: Was in the shower. Listening to sinister kid now :)
31/07/17, 18:13 - Infected: Queens of the stone age -  no one knows 

And

The toadies - possum kingdom
31/07/17, 18:14 - Infected: A lot of people think fall out boy is punk but they're not, these bands are two of the precursors for that type of music.
31/07/17, 18:14 - Arne: Another star
31/07/17, 18:15 - Tahnacious: Not super familiar with qotsa and toadies but I've heard of em
31/07/17, 18:16 - Tahnacious: I like sinister kid :)
31/07/17, 18:16 - Infected: I wouldn't say they were ever really popular.
31/07/17, 18:16 - Infected: You'll probably like most songs from the black keys.
31/07/17, 18:16 - Infected: 👍🏻
31/07/17, 18:17 - Tahnacious: Might just leave a playlist running then hehe
31/07/17, 18:17 - Infected: Check out the Arctic Monkeys too
31/07/17, 18:18 - Tahnacious: Already know and like them :)
31/07/17, 18:23 - Infected: : )
31/07/17, 18:26 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
31/07/17, 18:30 - Tahnacious: Lol I do this a lot. I also like the word.
31/07/17, 18:31 - Infected: I think it's a very intp word.
31/07/17, 18:34 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Yes.
31/07/17, 18:36 - Infected: I want to know who would want to listen to a playlist of "the 100 most uplifting songs of all time"
31/07/17, 18:42 - Tahnacious: Me
31/07/17, 18:42 - Tahnacious: To either cheer myself up
31/07/17, 18:43 - Tahnacious: Or if I was somehow in a good mood alread
31/07/17, 18:43 - Tahnacious: *already
31/07/17, 18:44 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Esfj's ;)
31/07/17, 18:45 - Infected: I never got into that mode. If I want to cheer myself up, I listen to EDM, usually. Happy songs make me cringe.
31/07/17, 18:45 - Infected: Banjos also put me in a good mood.
31/07/17, 18:47 - Infected: I suppose you could say there is a difference between "uplifting" and "happy" music. I should check it out.
31/07/17, 18:51 - Tahnacious: This
31/07/17, 18:52 - Infected: By my definition,  Victory by Trampled by Turtles is an uplifting song.
31/07/17, 18:53 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/VEC0gZvMVAI anime opening remixes are fun for lightening my mood
31/07/17, 18:53 - Infected: Look up a video called "pork chop sammiches"
31/07/17, 18:54 - Tahnacious: Will do ^^
31/07/17, 18:54 - Infected: It's a dub over of g.i. joes.
31/07/17, 18:58 - Tahnacious: Lmao!!!
31/07/17, 18:58 - Tahnacious: What is this madness xD

31/07/17, 19:20 - Tahnacious: Oh dear god it gets stuck in my head for days.
31/07/17, 19:20 - Tahnacious: It is the sort of thing I sing while drunk.
31/07/17, 19:21 - Infected: I get "bacon pancakes " stuck in my head.
31/07/17, 19:21 - Infected: A lot.
31/07/17, 19:22 - Infected: https://youtu.be/cUYSGojUuAU
31/07/17, 19:24 - Tahnacious: Haha it is actually catchy eh?
31/07/17, 19:25 - Infected: Yes.
31/07/17, 19:25 - Tahnacious: And yeah bacon pancakes is win. I had them in new York just because of that song.
31/07/17, 19:25 - Tahnacious: While playing said song...
31/07/17, 19:25 - Tahnacious: It just works so well
31/07/17, 19:25 - Infected: I had it as my ring tone for a while.
31/07/17, 19:26 - Tahnacious: Oooo that's a good idea actually
31/07/17, 19:26 - Infected: And the fish sandwich song.
31/07/17, 19:26 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/FSK5Gtf5bkA I have this as my ringtone
31/07/17, 19:31 - Tahnacious: Haha listening to that makes me actually want to eat one even though I don't like fish
31/07/17, 19:37 - Infected: https://youtu.be/IUV6ayf7hWI

31/07/17, 19:47 - FABIO: every month is something new

31/07/17, 20:41 - Tahnacious: Ooooo nice. I like it :)
31/07/17, 20:42 - Tahnacious: In my school they dressed a blow up doll in the school uniform and put it up on the school flagpole
31/07/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: Yeah that's the orgasming woman meme, nothing to do with harry potter, it was just a meme put in a harry potter scene for lulz
31/07/17, 21:18 - FABIO: LOOOOL
31/07/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: Another trick they did, release 3 sheep from the agriculture section and strap signs to them, 1, 2 and 4. The whole school was looking for sheep #3

31/07/17, 22:32 - FABIO: my 15 years old in 1 picture... hahahahah
31/07/17, 23:29 - Tahnacious: I've never dated a badass
31/07/17, 23:29 - Tahnacious: My ex's have always been the loser/geek and under 5/10 attractiveness
31/07/17, 23:29 - Tahnacious: Two of them had glasses too
31/07/17, 23:30 - Tahnacious: But honestly wouldn't mind having the buff guy in a leather jacket and sunglasses for once >.>
31/07/17, 23:30 - Tahnacious: Just to say I've done it
31/07/17, 23:30 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Want me to fix that?

31/07/17, 23:37 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I'm a loser
31/07/17, 23:38 - Tahnacious: That's OK, you'd suit me perfectly then xD
01/08/17, 00:06 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Oooh 😍
01/08/17, 00:08 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 00:19 - Infected: I've dated guys that thought they were badasses.
01/08/17, 00:22 - Tahnacious: Bahahahha that's even worse!
01/08/17, 00:25 - Infected: "You're a tool and I don't want to see you anymore. "
01/08/17, 00:25 - Tahnacious: Well done
01/08/17, 00:29 - Infected: I thought so. I'm told that I'm a frigid cunt. It amuses me.
01/08/17, 00:33 - Tahnacious: Anything that makes people mad at me amuses me too
01/08/17, 00:33 - Tahnacious: 😅
01/08/17, 00:33 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I thought it was only me
01/08/17, 00:33 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Are you masochist?
01/08/17, 00:33 - Tahnacious: We are all the same type here hah.
01/08/17, 00:34 - Tahnacious: I wouldn't really know, I haven't looked up the true definition of the word before or done any testing.
01/08/17, 00:35 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Nah, we're same type but different person
01/08/17, 00:36 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: How many non intp here btw
01/08/17, 00:37 - Tahnacious: At a guess maybe 10%
01/08/17, 00:37 - Tahnacious: Or less
01/08/17, 00:37 - Infected: The switch of personality at the moment you reject someone/ break up with them is amusing to me.
01/08/17, 00:37 - Tahnacious: Probably inferior function
01/08/17, 00:37 - Tahnacious: Me? I don't get angry when rejected, I run away and cry like a sissy.
01/08/17, 00:37 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: Stop being me people 😡😡😡
01/08/17, 00:38 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: I want to be unique
01/08/17, 00:38 - Tahnacious: Haha
01/08/17, 00:38 - Tahnacious: Usually when I break up with people they spend the first few weeks asking for me to come back
01/08/17, 00:38 - Tahnacious: Come back!!!

No.

Pleaaaaaseee


....no.


Aw cmon...


No.
01/08/17, 00:39 - Infected: We are a collection of unique individuals. You could we're limited edition, which, makes us valuable.
01/08/17, 00:39 - Shaiju: Because of your cry? Lol
01/08/17, 00:39 - Tahnacious: No, I've never been broken up with but I'm talking about when I do the breaking up
01/08/17, 00:39 - Tahnacious: The crying was more in highschool when boys told me straight to my face they didn't like me and didn't want to date me because I was unpopular
01/08/17, 00:40 - Tahnacious: When I was 14 with hormones buzzing it was a little overwhelming...
01/08/17, 00:40 - Infected: Sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn't but in almost every case, the guy has come back within two years to try and see me again.
01/08/17, 00:41 - Tahnacious: After the two weeks is up then the "well fuck you, you bitch!!!" Comes out
01/08/17, 00:42 - Tahnacious: The one who was originally most OK with the breakup ironically was my enfp
01/08/17, 00:42 - Tahnacious: I left him and didn't see him for 3 weeks when he asked me around to visit
01/08/17, 00:43 - Tahnacious: Then that night he broke down and started crying like a big baby because it wasn't until he saw me again he realised he's not ok
01/08/17, 00:43 - Infected: I wasn't interested in boys during high school. I found them all to be undesirable. They thought the same of me so it worked out. I was invisible unless doing someone's homework.
01/08/17, 00:43 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: INTJs more rare than us
01/08/17, 00:43 - Tahnacious: I was invisible but I had this terrible urge to belong somewhere... Or to somebody. I didn't care what, it was exhausting because I could never fit in.
01/08/17, 00:44 - Tahnacious: I got more stressed out trying to find my place while remaining invisible than I would have if I had've just said fuck it, I belong to me.
01/08/17, 00:45 - Tahnacious: It was just my Fe short circuiting really really bad
01/08/17, 00:45 - Infected: I never understood the desire to fit in among people that were largely unworthy of my presence.
01/08/17, 00:46 - Infected: I used to be quite lonely when I thought that people were supposed to find life mates and I was unable to do so.
01/08/17, 01:11 - Tahnacious: Yeah I think I am still stuck in that mindset
01/08/17, 01:11 - Tahnacious: Also I'm now drinking my unhappiness away
01/08/17, 01:12 - Tahnacious: Is didier around?
01/08/17, 01:16 - Infected: I could only speculate.
01/08/17, 01:17 - Janith: What unhappiness?
01/08/17, 01:18 - Janith: @6582280971!!!!!
01/08/17, 01:18 - Janith: You are needed!!
01/08/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: General apathy/depression. Nothing serious
01/08/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 01:18 - Tahnacious: Summon button
01/08/17, 01:18 - Janith: Oh that. I just listen to music or go on a killing spree in a game
01/08/17, 01:19 - Janith: The latter is quite relaxing
01/08/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: I want to but what game? I'm currently playing watchdogs and relying on more of a stealth run
01/08/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: Playing it almost assassin creed style
01/08/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: But yeah I'm listening to music currently
01/08/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: But drinking helps
01/08/17, 01:19 - Tahnacious: I'm generally a jolly drunk
01/08/17, 01:20 - Janith: Well I enjoyed the killing I'm watch dogs 2. The profiler adds individuality to people so it's more fun
01/08/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: Yeah :) I love it
01/08/17, 01:20 - Janith: I don't like killing in gta cause the victims are anonymous
01/08/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: Will play 2 when I'm done with 1
01/08/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: So ummm
01/08/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: Someone told me I'm too obsessed with mbti
01/08/17, 01:20 - Tahnacious: I agree
01/08/17, 01:20 - Janith: There's also shadow warrior 2. It has monsters and procedurally generated gore
01/08/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: I need another pet hobby to research and get obsessed with
01/08/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: Something I can absorb myself with intellectually
01/08/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: Any ideas?
01/08/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: Sounds good
01/08/17, 01:21 - Janith: It's ridiculously fun to slice and dice enemies with a chainsaw katana till they're mush
01/08/17, 01:21 - Tahnacious: Haha
01/08/17, 01:21 - Janith: Machine learning?
01/08/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: Which machine?
01/08/17, 01:22 - Janith: The whole blockchain thing
01/08/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: I prefer deep abstract and questionable realms I guess
01/08/17, 01:22 - Janith: No I mean machine learning as in the tool used for image recognition and ai for programming
01/08/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: Ohhhh
01/08/17, 01:22 - Janith: The meaning of life? 😆
01/08/17, 01:22 - Tahnacious: That's interesting enough I guess
01/08/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: Are they still offering prize money for the discovery?
01/08/17, 01:23 - Janith: No but I enjoyed my time with the subject
01/08/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: God damnit hahaha
01/08/17, 01:23 - Janith: Generally came out much happier than I went in
01/08/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: Alright I'll try that too
01/08/17, 01:23 - Tahnacious: Thank you
01/08/17, 01:24 - Janith: It's absurdism for me 😁
01/08/17, 01:24 - Janith: Also do you do any coding?
01/08/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: Though I'd prefer to have been paid for my efforts >_>
01/08/17, 01:24 - Janith: Yeah me too. If you want to get paid why not freelancer?
01/08/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: I'm vaguely familiar, learned one language which is currently moot. I know the structure.
01/08/17, 01:24 - Tahnacious: Because I suck at everything I do
01/08/17, 01:24 - Janith: freelancer.com if I remember correctly
01/08/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: I touch it. It implodes
01/08/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 01:25 - Janith: A lot of INTPs think that
01/08/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: Might as well try it
01/08/17, 01:25 - Janith: I used to think I sucked at physics till I got an A for it in my finals
01/08/17, 01:25 - Janith: Then I spent a couple of months trying to figure out how it could be a fluke 😂
01/08/17, 01:25 - Tahnacious: Maybe I could learn to sing. I'm drunk enough
01/08/17, 01:26 - Janith: Learn to sing death core
01/08/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: Doesn't that involve learning to do screamo style vocals?
01/08/17, 01:26 - Janith: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hf04EYSifjE
01/08/17, 01:26 - Tahnacious: Hahaha I was practically the opposite
01/08/17, 01:26 - Janith: This. Perfect yo try when you're drunk 😂
01/08/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Our physics teacher at the beginning was fired and he was the only qualified teacher
01/08/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: He was a pedophile and they found kiddie porn everywhere
01/08/17, 01:27 - Janith: Yikes. How come?
01/08/17, 01:27 - Janith: Oh 😂
01/08/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Yeah I know right?!
01/08/17, 01:27 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 01:27 - Janith: Yeah that can be hard to glaze over in the resume
01/08/17, 01:28 - Tahnacious: Anyway our class ended up being self taught
01/08/17, 01:28 - Tahnacious: I distinctly remember a stand in teacher just giving us a pop quiz for lulz, just a premade printed one from the old teachers source material
01/08/17, 01:29 - Janith: Question. How drunk are you know?
01/08/17, 01:29 - Tahnacious: I got 100% in that test, higher than the dux of the school
01/08/17, 01:29 - Tahnacious: Maybe 5/10, working on it
01/08/17, 01:29 - Janith: Wow. Impressive 😮
01/08/17, 01:30 - Tahnacious: But yeah it was because it was a test that was on the spot and it didn't count towards final marks
01/08/17, 01:30 - Janith: Considering you're an INTP is say that's drunk enough. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU2k-U2Ze0o
01/08/17, 01:30 - Janith: Try singing along to that
01/08/17, 01:30 - Tahnacious: Okay ^_^ I love Korn
01/08/17, 01:30 - Janith: Me too! This is one of my favorite songs.
01/08/17, 01:30 - Tahnacious: But yeah the stand in teacher actually went as far to call my bullshit
01/08/17, 01:31 - Janith: Perfect to sing when the Ne is taking over
01/08/17, 01:31 - Tahnacious: Like excuse me miss invisible no one knows you... How can you get 100% when the next highest mark was 64
01/08/17, 01:31 - Janith: Can't fight genius tho 😎
01/08/17, 01:31 - Infected: I used to greatly enjoy playing guitar hero when I was drunk.
01/08/17, 01:31 - Tahnacious: Lol the teacher pulled another test in and made me do it to prove I was cheating
01/08/17, 01:31 - Tahnacious: Watched over my shoulder as I did it
01/08/17, 01:31 - Tahnacious: Pressured me
01/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: And of course I did just OK, around 60ish
01/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: Because of pressure...
01/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: Then the principal heard about this
01/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: Ooooh boy was he mad
01/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: He was so pissed at that stand in teacher xD
01/08/17, 01:32 - Janith: I've never been drunk so I didn't get a chance to do a drink gaming session yet 😂
01/08/17, 01:32 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I think you'll like dishonored @61477394075
01/08/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: He went on about my IQ results and blamed her for stifling my intellectual growth with too much pressure
01/08/17, 01:33 - Infected: I always like your stories.
01/08/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: Oh yes, I tried it a bit and loved it. My computer died part way through though :(
01/08/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: Thank you, I enjoy telling them :)
01/08/17, 01:33 - Janith: I'm generally immune to external pressure during tests. It's all just Meh now
01/08/17, 01:33 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Oh
01/08/17, 01:34 - Janith: Me too. @61477394075 you should be our designated storyteller :D
01/08/17, 01:34 - Infected: I concur.
01/08/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: Oh I thought I was fine but I always had this issue where people went on about how smart I was and then placed huge expectations on me, the stress of meeting it all was my downfall.
01/08/17, 01:34 - Janith: Curious. How much is your IQ?
01/08/17, 01:35 - Tahnacious: Thank ye
01/08/17, 01:35 - Tahnacious: Wasn't able to be measured. Test only went to 150 in Australia.
01/08/17, 01:35 - Tahnacious: But the testers said it was likely only a little above that.
01/08/17, 01:36 - Tahnacious: I'm sure one that goes to 200 is available now.
01/08/17, 01:36 - Infected: Much better than mine lul
01/08/17, 01:36 - FABIO: how come
01/08/17, 01:36 - FABIO: we always end up in iq tests
01/08/17, 01:36 - Janith: Ah right. In that case I definitely recommend taking some time to look into philosophy. It killed off whatever was left of my ability to care about expectations. I had that kinds pressure too
01/08/17, 01:36 - FABIO: is like dick size....
01/08/17, 01:36 - Tahnacious: Meh, after a certain amount intelligence is almost a handicap, you see everything wrong with the world and it only makes you more miserable.
01/08/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: I think its better to just be "above average" 110-130 is enough to get places enough but not enough to actually make you batshit crazy.
01/08/17, 01:37 - Janith: Oh we're not talking about it in depth. Just a curiosity
01/08/17, 01:37 - Lulu: Heyyy guys what's been going on
01/08/17, 01:37 - Janith: But batshit crazy is half the fun :(
01/08/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: I said enough too many times...
01/08/17, 01:38 - Infected: A lot of people find them to be important. I don't like standard i.q. tests.
01/08/17, 01:38 - Tahnacious: That just illustrates how absent minded I am
01/08/17, 01:38 - Lulu: TBH I've never taken an IQ test
01/08/17, 01:38 - Janith: Hello again catwoman 😊
01/08/17, 01:38 - FABIO: dick size doesnt matter... only the small ones say that
01/08/17, 01:38 - Lulu: But I also don't give a fuck about what my IQ may be so lol
01/08/17, 01:38 - FABIO: hahahahahahahahaa
01/08/17, 01:38 - Janith: Me neither
01/08/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: They're just a way of quantifying a thing, it's been proven these type of tests pander to the INTP mindset anyway, therefore they are more likely to do well.
01/08/17, 01:39 - Infected: Depending on what type of i.q. test I take, I either get 117 to 124. I am batshit crazy.
01/08/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 01:39 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: I think the craziness was just an added extra included with the Infected bundle
01/08/17, 01:39 - Janith: It actually depends on the measurement you use for size. If it's just length then it doesn't matter
01/08/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: Cream on the cake.
01/08/17, 01:39 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 01:39 - Tahnacious: With a cherry on top
01/08/17, 01:40 - Infected: It was on sale "as is" heh
01/08/17, 01:40 - Janith: Honestly k don't know how the non-batshit people survive in this world
01/08/17, 01:40 - Tahnacious: Limited edition bundle, take it or leave it.
01/08/17, 01:40 - Infected: Accurate.
01/08/17, 01:41 - Lulu: I'm just playing an American Dad live stream on YouTube and drawing
01/08/17, 01:41 - Lulu: Y'all talking about dickw
01/08/17, 01:41 - Infected: Because ignorant.
01/08/17, 01:41 - Lulu: Dicks*
01/08/17, 01:41 - Infected: It was an analogy.
01/08/17, 01:42 - Janith: Oh that reminds me, what do you guys think about intelligence as a deadly mutation? As I'm it's actually detrimental to the survival of a species
01/08/17, 01:42 - Lulu: Wouldn't know didn't read through the 1000+ messages 🤷🏻‍♀
01/08/17, 01:42 - Janith: How many guys do you know who don't like to talk about their dicks? 😂
01/08/17, 01:42 - FABIO: being dumb actually makes you have more childrem
01/08/17, 01:42 - Tahnacious: Besides while I know INTPs enjoy being intelligent there are other important things in life.
01/08/17, 01:42 - Tahnacious: I've noticed this
01/08/17, 01:42 - FABIO: but i doubt in the hability to mantain theyr health
01/08/17, 01:43 - Janith: Yeah exactly. The higher you go in intelligence in the animal kingdom the lower the amount of offspring
01/08/17, 01:43 - Lulu: It has merit from a biological sense in regular mechanics of survival
01/08/17, 01:43 - Infected: Literally 4 posts above your entering statement.
01/08/17, 01:43 - Lulu: But overall eh
01/08/17, 01:43 - Infected: This.
01/08/17, 01:43 - Tahnacious: Which is why I'm tempted to either have 1 or none at all
01/08/17, 01:43 - Lulu: Yeah didn't read that either
01/08/17, 01:44 - FABIO: you guys think..... suicide.. is being more. common?
01/08/17, 01:44 - Lulu: Only statistics can tell
01/08/17, 01:44 - FABIO: i kept reading about it lately...
01/08/17, 01:44 - Janith: @15015198024 you should never expect an INTP not to be lazy 😂
01/08/17, 01:44 - Infected: I am #triggered. Lul
01/08/17, 01:44 - Lulu: It's probably just more talked about but I haven't seen recent statistics
01/08/17, 01:44 - Lulu: Lol sorry 😂😂
01/08/17, 01:44 - Janith: I can't help but think there's a certain correlation between secularism and suicide
01/08/17, 01:45 - Infected: I think it is more common among certain groups of people.
01/08/17, 01:45 - Tahnacious: I don't think it is deadly per se, I think it is something that will involve mass extinction on earth sure, but not the end of the most intelligent species, surely
01/08/17, 01:45 - FABIO: latelly we have way more of that pumpous gays
01/08/17, 01:45 - FABIO: you know... not the ones that like men.. the other kind...
01/08/17, 01:45 - FABIO: the scandalous ones...
01/08/17, 01:45 - Janith: I don't know about you guys but after ditching all existing assumptions about the "meaning of life" I did spend some time in a state where I couldn't find a reason to live
01/08/17, 01:45 - FABIO: same
01/08/17, 01:46 - Lulu: S.A.S.S.Y 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
01/08/17, 01:46 - FABIO: but it hit me....
01/08/17, 01:46 - Janith: Maybe more people make hasty decisions while still stuck in that phase
01/08/17, 01:46 - Infected: The meaning of life is to give meaning to life.
01/08/17, 01:46 - Tahnacious: We are the most intelligent animals on earth, we aren't the fastest, the ones with the best vision, the best hearing... But we have our kinds and that is why we are on top of the food chain, we have more control over the planet than any others and intimately I believe all animals will go extinct before humans die out.
01/08/17, 01:46 - FABIO: THATS... what we call recursion.. in coding
01/08/17, 01:46 - FABIO: and oh god how is hard to understand this shit
01/08/17, 01:47 - Tahnacious: All other animals, that is. I still see us as a type of animal, just that our gift is intellect and speech
01/08/17, 01:47 - Infected: I can give you the long explanation but it is only my opinion, even though I'm right.
01/08/17, 01:47 - Tahnacious: The awkward moment when a downs syndrome person is wheeled in to the room...

"And your gift is...?"
01/08/17, 01:47 - FABIO: totally doctor who speech
01/08/17, 01:47 - FABIO: hahahahahah
01/08/17, 01:47 - Janith: You're wise so you don't count 😆
01/08/17, 01:47 - Tahnacious: Yeah, oops.
01/08/17, 01:48 - FABIO: i agree with you.. just sayd that recursion is hard
01/08/17, 01:48 - FABIO: hahahaha
01/08/17, 01:48 - Infected: I can't process that statement.
01/08/17, 01:48 - Janith: I highly doubt that. Unless we make a conscous effort to exterminate all animals before we go out
01/08/17, 01:48 - Lulu: Focusing on your bullet fast messages distracted me from singing the American Dad into thanks
01/08/17, 01:48 - Lulu: 😭
01/08/17, 01:48 - Infected: We are the most intelligent in the way that we measure intelligence.
01/08/17, 01:48 - Lulu: Intro
01/08/17, 01:49 - FABIO: thats deep... but yet.. i dont see them having WIFI
01/08/17, 01:49 - Lulu: Well yeah lol
01/08/17, 01:49 - Janith: besides humans are not the most resilient species
01/08/17, 01:49 - Tahnacious: That is also true. We may not have stronger instinctual intelligence than some.
01/08/17, 01:49 - Lulu: Idk that's just kinda common sense imo but that's me
01/08/17, 01:49 - Janith: The group is on fire right now 😂😂😂
01/08/17, 01:49 - Infected: I.e. we believe that we are the most intelligent therefore we measure all other creatures against our basis for understanding intelligence.
01/08/17, 01:49 - Lulu: It's like a elephant in the room type deal
01/08/17, 01:50 - FABIO: dick sise....
01/08/17, 01:50 - FABIO: hahahahah
01/08/17, 01:50 - Lulu: Obvious but not recognized
01/08/17, 01:50 - Tahnacious: I have a feeling the earth will turn in to a cesspit and we will all be forced to move to another planet before it implodes.
01/08/17, 01:50 - Lulu: Probably
01/08/17, 01:50 - Janith: I think the fact that we've considered intelligence to be a good thing for so long could have blinded us to the possibility that it's detrimental to the species
01/08/17, 01:50 - FABIO: @50494800614 still needs to devlop the theory for the enginee
01/08/17, 01:50 - FABIO: hahahahahaha
01/08/17, 01:51 - Infected: I like to point out the obvious because some people lack common sense. I'm also a dick.
01/08/17, 01:51 - Lulu: As a species maybe, as a society no
01/08/17, 01:51 - Tahnacious: Family guy intro is better ^_^
01/08/17, 01:51 - Janith: Of course I'm not denying that intelligence is also the only way to get out of extinction
01/08/17, 01:51 - Lulu: Hmm I still find the ad one more enjoyable to sing I guess
01/08/17, 01:51 - Tahnacious: This is true
01/08/17, 01:52 - Janith: Maybe that's why Juancho is missing. He's working on the engine
01/08/17, 01:52 - FABIO: smart guy
01/08/17, 01:52 - FABIO: keeps good work
01/08/17, 01:52 - FABIO: hahahaha
01/08/17, 01:52 - Shaiju: 😂
01/08/17, 01:52 - Infected: How many species are extinct due to human intervention?
01/08/17, 01:53 - Tahnacious: I don't want to count
01/08/17, 01:53 - Tahnacious: But I can google
01/08/17, 01:53 - FABIO: way less than the ones not from our intervantion
01/08/17, 01:53 - Lulu: Lol
01/08/17, 01:53 - FABIO: :3 if you take all extintions
01/08/17, 01:53 - Janith: Due to indirect reasons it's a little too high to be comfortable typing xD
01/08/17, 01:53 - Lulu: Yes but considering the rate of which since our advancements, a lot
01/08/17, 01:54 - Infected: That was something I thought of when I made my original point. The meaning of life.
01/08/17, 01:54 - Lulu: I think
01/08/17, 01:54 - Lulu: Once again IDK the statistics I'm just educated guessing  tbh
01/08/17, 01:54 - Janith: Well nature took billions of years to take out all those species. We did it in a couple of generations
01/08/17, 01:55 - Lulu: P much what I just said lol
01/08/17, 01:55 - Tahnacious: "The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.*These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** -  then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year.But if the upper estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and 100,000 species are becoming extinct each year.*Experts actually call this natural extinction rate the background extinction rate. This simply means the rate of species extinctions that would occur if we humans were not around.

** Between 1.4 and 1.8 million species have already been scientifically identified. "
01/08/17, 01:55 - FABIO: we need barbecue
01/08/17, 01:55 - FABIO: hahahahah
01/08/17, 01:55 - Lulu: I have my college orientation for tomorrow yaaay
01/08/17, 01:55 - Janith: And you need to remember that we weren't even trying 😂
01/08/17, 01:55 - Lulu: Wow bad sentence
01/08/17, 01:55 - FABIO: what is it?
01/08/17, 01:55 - Lulu: Orientation
01/08/17, 01:56 - Lulu: For college
01/08/17, 01:56 - FABIO: yeah.....
01/08/17, 01:56 - FABIO: like what?
01/08/17, 01:56 - Lulu: I get to choose my courses and shit
01/08/17, 01:56 - Tahnacious: Imagine if we tried to kill all other animals...
01/08/17, 01:56 - FABIO: use condom? drink a lot in parties
01/08/17, 01:56 - Tahnacious: The nukes...
01/08/17, 01:56 - FABIO: or what courses to take?
01/08/17, 01:56 - Janith: College starts ridiculously late over here. I have months to go 😭
01/08/17, 01:56 - Lulu: And there's a lot of introductory bull shit
01/08/17, 01:56 - Tahnacious: What condom lol
01/08/17, 01:57 - FABIO: there are deseases.. and this days... they dont marry virgin anymore
01/08/17, 01:57 - Lulu: Its a community college so it's very hand holdy but TBH I probably need it seeing how I ended my senior year
01/08/17, 01:57 - FABIO: we need to take carry
01/08/17, 01:57 - FABIO: care*
01/08/17, 01:57 - FABIO: hahahahahaha
01/08/17, 01:57 - Infected: If you look at it from a thinking perspective, humanity will be the reason for the extinction of life on earth long before the sun explodes.
01/08/17, 01:57 - Lulu: Yay
01/08/17, 01:57 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 01:58 - Infected: Lul
01/08/17, 01:58 - Lulu: What a beautiful order
01/08/17, 01:58 - FABIO: hahhahahahaaha
01/08/17, 01:58 - Janith: Oh yeah I remember reading that 1 out of 6 american teens have HPV or something
01/08/17, 01:58 - Lulu: LMAO what
01/08/17, 01:58 - Infected: Anti-vaxxers
01/08/17, 01:58 - FABIO: 😂😂
01/08/17, 01:59 - Janith: Just to clarify I didn't look into this too much. It didn't feel important
01/08/17, 01:59 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 02:00 - Tahnacious: Implied beastiality
01/08/17, 02:00 - Janith: Stuff like that really makes me wonder why the US isn't great friends with all the middle east. Rampant stupidity seems to be all the rage in both areas
01/08/17, 02:00 - Infected: Getting there.
01/08/17, 02:00 - Lulu: My internet just shit itself
01/08/17, 02:00 - Tahnacious: I know, it would make life so easy...
01/08/17, 02:01 - FABIO: or you have viruses
01/08/17, 02:01 - Lulu: Nah it just shit itself
01/08/17, 02:01 - FABIO: im from brazil and i have a good internet
01/08/17, 02:01 - Janith: Or you've been looking at cat pictures too much
01/08/17, 02:01 - FABIO: how can you not?
01/08/17, 02:01 - FABIO: nothing works here....
01/08/17, 02:01 - Infected: I've considered starting my own country. Maybe do a kickstarter.
01/08/17, 02:01 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 02:01 - Tahnacious: Sometimes modems just have their own little hissy fit
01/08/17, 02:01 - FABIO: ohhh
01/08/17, 02:02 - FABIO: i know what your problem is
01/08/17, 02:02 - FABIO: THE CHANNEL
01/08/17, 02:02 - Tahnacious: Exactly just reset modem
01/08/17, 02:02 - FABIO: all your neighbours are using the same channel
01/08/17, 02:02 - FABIO: it interferes with yours
01/08/17, 02:02 - Lulu: I didn't feel like dealing with it so I just turned my phone internet off
01/08/17, 02:02 - Lulu: No
01/08/17, 02:02 - Tahnacious: Yeah and IP address
01/08/17, 02:02 - Lulu: This is our own lol
01/08/17, 02:02 - Janith: Maybe we could take over Asgardia?
01/08/17, 02:02 - Tahnacious: I am very for this idea. I would love a country just for intps
01/08/17, 02:02 - Janith: What do you guys say? Our own INTP space colony?
01/08/17, 02:02 - Tahnacious: Automated citizenship
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: That too
01/08/17, 02:03 - Lulu: A cat probably knocked over a wire I don't fucking know
01/08/17, 02:03 - Infected: I like the self sufficient floating island concept.
01/08/17, 02:03 - Lulu: Either way the router needs to be reset
01/08/17, 02:03 - Janith: We'd probably die because we were too lazy to replace the CO2 scrubbers but meh
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: As long as spouses were accommodated for
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: If we picked one
01/08/17, 02:03 - FABIO: we try to help
01/08/17, 02:03 - FABIO: people never listen
01/08/17, 02:03 - FABIO: :/
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: That's ok
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: Keeps some spouses
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: All the other types
01/08/17, 02:03 - Infected: I wouldn't even mind assigned spouses. I'd be more likely to get along.
01/08/17, 02:03 - FABIO: have you guys watched THE 100?
01/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: And they can do the work :)
01/08/17, 02:03 - Infected: Yes
01/08/17, 02:03 - Lulu: People are too stubborn to listen rip
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: that series
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: needed a nice intp guy
01/08/17, 02:04 - Tahnacious: Yeah funnily enough I'd be OK with that too.
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: to help tem
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: them
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: one with ENGINEERING degree
01/08/17, 02:04 - Infected: Agreed
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: fuck sake... they are too fucking dumb
01/08/17, 02:04 - Lulu: I wanna figure out my internet situation
01/08/17, 02:04 - Lulu: But I also dont
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: dont know how they survived so long
01/08/17, 02:04 - FABIO: hahahahahaha
01/08/17, 02:04 - Janith: Can I object to this please?
01/08/17, 02:05 - Tahnacious: There's less female than male intps so naturally if we wanted to procreate then we would have to outsource a little. Get a a few people who are actual able to carry out tasks
01/08/17, 02:05 - FABIO: dont need.. i told you what will help... you just dont care
01/08/17, 02:05 - Lulu: No you didn't lol, I'm literally the only one on it
01/08/17, 02:05 - Infected: Their "city" was poorly planned, they had no basic survival skills, and the leadership was shit.
01/08/17, 02:05 - Tahnacious: I think it is more of a cade if you can't choose then on sufficient enough for the colony will be chosen for you.
01/08/17, 02:05 - FABIO: the one i liked the most... was the bad one... with the gun
01/08/17, 02:05 - Lulu: We have our own password protected connection and it's 1am
01/08/17, 02:05 - FABIO: that guy.. i really liked hin....
01/08/17, 02:05 - Janith: I'm just not interested in the idea of spouses at the moment. I don't mind the 'assigned' part
01/08/17, 02:05 - Lulu: I'm. The only one on
01/08/17, 02:06 - FABIO: in a situation like that.. i would turn out to be hin... or some ermit with WIFI
01/08/17, 02:06 - FABIO: hahahahaha
01/08/17, 02:06 - Infected: I liked Lincoln.
01/08/17, 02:06 - FABIO: the neighbours wifi.. is messing your signal
01/08/17, 02:06 - Janith: I should watch the 100
01/08/17, 02:06 - Tahnacious: That's OK, you wouldn't have to copulate against your own will, that would be mean.
01/08/17, 02:06 - Lulu: Why would that happen right now but never a different day
01/08/17, 02:06 - Lulu: Lol
01/08/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: Damn I'm getting drunk, typing getting sloppy...
01/08/17, 02:07 - FABIO: its a channel thing.. its random

01/08/17, 02:07 - Janith: Can I volunteer to be uploaded into the mainframe ✋
01/08/17, 02:07 - FABIO: so its a mess to deliver the packeges

01/08/17, 02:07 - Lulu: I just need to reset  the router
01/08/17, 02:07 - Lulu: But I'm lazy
01/08/17, 02:07 - Infected: There could be a program for people interested in a spouse but unable to locate one. You could be matched via algorithm.
01/08/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: That works. I would love for my consciousness yo be converted to binary
01/08/17, 02:07 - FABIO: do it.. from the command line
01/08/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: *to
01/08/17, 02:07 - Lulu: Also that knowledge wouldn't really help
01/08/17, 02:08 - Lulu: The command line is on my mother's laptop
01/08/17, 02:08 - Tahnacious: I feel this should be the INTP password
01/08/17, 02:08 - Janith: Time for some drunk shenanigans!
01/08/17, 02:08 - FABIO: no
01/08/17, 02:08 - Lulu: I need to get up either way
01/08/17, 02:08 - FABIO: the command line is in the router

01/08/17, 02:12 - Lulu: Train of thought always derailed
01/08/17, 02:12 - Infected: Good job.
01/08/17, 02:12 - Janith: Guys guys I think this is the point where we start questioning our existence 😂
01/08/17, 02:13 - Tahnacious: At least I tried

01/08/17, 02:13 - Lulu: I found it more a yell than a scream
01/08/17, 02:14 - Lulu: But a very nice yell
01/08/17, 02:14 - Janith: We're in this group. Isn't it obvious everyone here has issues? 😂

01/08/17, 02:17 - Infected: I would rather trees give WiFi signal. We'd be less likely to disrupt habitats.

01/08/17, 02:17 - Janith: If trees gave WiFi there would be trees every couple of meters

01/08/17, 02:18 - FABIO: i cant have pets
01/08/17, 02:18 - Infected: That's the point. They would obstruct people from entering my habitat.
01/08/17, 02:18 - FABIO: only robots
01/08/17, 02:18 - Tahnacious: #90slyfe
01/08/17, 02:18 - Tahnacious: I have cats because I am a lonely woman

01/08/17, 02:23 - Infected: He was in anticipation of his monthly treat box.
01/08/17, 02:23 - Janith: So I was right about the "meaning of life" part 😂

01/08/17, 02:31 - Infected: This cat is sexier than I could ever be.
01/08/17, 02:31 - Lulu: It truly is but when unnatural it's just dishonest in a way although I can't say I also don't do it sometimes
01/08/17, 02:31 - Lulu: FERGALICIOUS DEFINITION
01/08/17, 02:31 - Tahnacious: Kumo has perfectly symmetrical markings :)

01/08/17, 02:45 - Lulu: It can also be named "a 16 year old sees opportunity in a white notebook and her many off colored sharpies and also decides to add a sticker"
01/08/17, 02:46 - Lulu: I'm not 16 I just was at the time of it lol

01/08/17, 02:46 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 02:47 - Infected: They no longer served a purpose, I guess.
01/08/17, 02:47 - Lulu: Oh well
01/08/17, 02:47 - Lulu: Rip drawings
01/08/17, 02:48 - Infected: I wouldn't exactly call myself artistic, anyway.
01/08/17, 02:48 - Tahnacious: I draw, a lot
01/08/17, 02:48 - Lulu: Me too
01/08/17, 02:49 - Lulu: If I'm not feeling anything I just draw bodies and legs and eyes
01/08/17, 02:49 - Lulu: Lots of legs and eyes
01/08/17, 02:49 - Lulu: Torsos are nice

01/08/17, 02:51 - Lulu: I was 13 at the time of that I believe
01/08/17, 02:51 - Lulu: I glued it to this half black half red painting with Morse code scribbled along it
01/08/17, 02:52 - Lulu: No specific words just numbers and then the alphabet
01/08/17, 02:52 - Lulu: I remember making sure to press down hard enough so I could feel the
01/08/17, 02:52 - Lulu: Wait no that's brail
01/08/17, 02:52 - Lulu: I guess I use to mistake Morse for brail oops
01/08/17, 02:53 - Lulu: But it was Morse that I scribbled on it

01/08/17, 12:54 - Tahnacious: My mum has blue eyes. I have all the genetic markers for blue eyes but my eyes are actually kind of an orangish yellow
01/08/17, 12:54 - Tahnacious: Amber if you will
01/08/17, 12:54 - Tahnacious: Simply because the blue eye gene messed with the brown eye gene and made it lighter than usual
01/08/17, 12:55 - Tahnacious: My ex always used to tell me my eyes looked red to him
01/08/17, 12:57 - Tahnacious: But yeah, just off an interpretation of my genes I'm supposed to have blue eyes or at least hazel. It is weird.
01/08/17, 12:58 - Shaiju: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 13:00 - Didier: Lang Leav!She is my favourite poet!
01/08/17, 13:01 - Shaiju: Are you my girl?🤔😂
01/08/17, 13:02 - Tahnacious: This.
01/08/17, 13:03 - Tahnacious: I didn't know other intps enjoyed exploring emotive works
01/08/17, 13:03 - Tahnacious: I thought I was just a weirdo...
01/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: Emotive works are beautiful that's why
01/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: They are a proof u have feelings,so don't worry that u don't
01/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: Your girl? 😂
01/08/17, 13:06 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 13:06 - Tahnacious: So didi I have a question for you
01/08/17, 13:07 - Tahnacious: I was talking to an INFP earlier, I'm the only INTP they know
01/08/17, 13:09 - Tahnacious: He is under the impression that I'm a rare outlier and that he wouldn't like most INTPs based on the info he has read on us
01/08/17, 13:09 - Tahnacious: So what I would like is your opinion on interacting with INTPs
01/08/17, 13:10 - Tahnacious: How do you find us, are we really the emotionless husks that we are depicted as ?
01/08/17, 13:11 - Shaiju: Let me drift away
Like the aimless wind
From the shadows of my broken past
Let me drift away
From the depths of my thoughts
Through the valley of death 
Let my soul rest in peace
Inebriated by sadness
01/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: Nope.One thing I noticed is that intps will not try to use feelings to affect their views,and that's why they can seem cold,unfeeling at times.Other than that,I feel that u all are warm people.
01/08/17, 13:11 - Shaiju: :)
01/08/17, 13:12 - Tel: Interesting convo.. I'm Gna go now my lawn and catch up on it in a bit
01/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: Haha kay
01/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: While I gotta sleep
01/08/17, 13:12 - Tel: Ah darn
01/08/17, 13:12 - Shaiju: Lol 😂
01/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: Is that one of hers again 😃
01/08/17, 13:12 - Tel: Hm, cool re warm ppl though. Interesting. Is that because of this group, though, or external influences?
01/08/17, 13:13 - Shaiju: Nope.. it's just mine.. wrote it just now... :)
01/08/17, 13:13 - Tel: It'd be interesting to gain your perspective of an INTP you haven't explored the inner workings of their mind with, if that makes sense
01/08/17, 13:13 - Didier: It's really nice!
01/08/17, 13:13 - Didier: U should make more poems
01/08/17, 13:13 - Didier: I like it'
01/08/17, 13:13 - Shaiju: Thank you :)
01/08/17, 13:13 - Didier: I can feel the emotion haha
01/08/17, 13:14 - Didier: External influences?
01/08/17, 13:14 - Shaiju: Ha ha...
01/08/17, 13:14 - Didier: I think it's this group because I don't know if I know any intp outside
01/08/17, 13:14 - Tel: Yea, as in other ppl outside of the group
01/08/17, 13:14 - Tel: Ah ok
01/08/17, 13:15 - Didier: Maybe it's because those info is too generalized?
01/08/17, 13:16 - Didier: are*
01/08/17, 13:16 - Tahnacious: Thanks :)
01/08/17, 13:19 - Tahnacious: Probably
01/08/17, 13:19 - Tahnacious: I wrote a short story in school and I still have it
01/08/17, 13:26 - Shaiju: Care to share?
01/08/17, 13:30 - Tahnacious: Trying to find it hah..  I had a copy of it on my phone but my phone was stolen... I think I took screenshots though and put them on Google cloud but still looking
01/08/17, 13:34 - Tahnacious: OK I think I'm ready to give up. swear I saw it a few days back
01/08/17, 13:35 - Amin: Give what up?
01/08/17, 13:36 - Shaiju: Procrastination mode ON. May be some other time... I will do it,😉 I swear!
01/08/17, 13:37 - Amin: Procrastination is a bad thing
01/08/17, 13:38 - Amin: I would like to read it
01/08/17, 13:38 - Amin: @6582280971  seeking to talk to you
01/08/17, 13:39 - Shaiju: Is it? I always thought that was best thing to keep your mind sane along with the inflated ego rather than trying something out finding how difficult it is. At least in my mind ;I can do it,it's just that I don't prefer to do it now.. 🤔
01/08/17, 13:39 - Shaiju: *and
01/08/17, 13:41 - Amin: All you say means one thing too me, you sound lazy, and so powerless that instead of doing, you talk
01/08/17, 13:41 - Amin: Do it
01/08/17, 13:41 - Amin: If its done then you did it
01/08/17, 13:41 - Amin: If its not, then uve failed
01/08/17, 13:42 - Didier: Haha tmr then,gtg
01/08/17, 13:43 - Didier: Not necessarily.For some people,it's a stress reliver and they will really finish the thing they wanted to afterwards
01/08/17, 13:43 - Shaiju: Do what? 😂I was just trying to  reflect up on... it's just that I am trying to gauge your response...
01/08/17, 13:43 - Didier: That's why,must put it to good use 😏
01/08/17, 13:43 - Amin: Such a shame😞
01/08/17, 13:43 - Didier: reliever*
01/08/17, 13:43 - Didier: Hahaha
01/08/17, 13:43 - Didier: I'm here now tho

01/08/17, 13:44 - Amin: Why?
01/08/17, 13:44 - Amin: How is life going?
01/08/17, 13:45 - Amin: I prefer doing it faster than every one, and better than every one
01/08/17, 13:45 - Didier: Having exams 😂
01/08/17, 13:45 - Shaiju: Simply because I can.. it's just that 'testing theories' about human behaviour part of INTP brain in action..
01/08/17, 13:45 - Amin: 😂😂 u doing good ?
01/08/17, 13:45 - Didier: And I haven't study for biology tmr

01/08/17, 13:45 - Didier: Good at social studies

01/08/17, 13:47 - Shaiju: 🤔 why should I? That was just it..   there is no goal for me to achieve here. Why should some one lie for nothing?....
01/08/17, 13:47 - Didier: Means 50% from each
01/08/17, 13:47 - Didier: It's counted as one subject
01/08/17, 13:47 - Didier: For the score
01/08/17, 13:47 - Amin: How old are you?
01/08/17, 13:48 - Amin: Aaah, so you are getting half, why dont u like history?
01/08/17, 13:48 - Shaiju: Old enough to be called young!
01/08/17, 13:49 - Amin: So u r just a kid right? 14?
01/08/17, 13:50 - Didier: I like history itself but not for school 😂
01/08/17, 13:51 - Didier: The way schools teach...not for me
01/08/17, 13:51 - Didier: The way we learn
01/08/17, 13:51 - Didier: U can call it old-fashioned
01/08/17, 13:52 - Amin: Yeah, but School structure is really worthy
01/08/17, 13:52 - Shaiju: 🙃 14? I am curious how do you pull 14? Is there any logical thinking behind it? Or a random support point to begin logical deduction or inductive exploration? Anyway I am older than you...😉
01/08/17, 13:52 - Amin: 14?
01/08/17, 13:53 - Didier: 😂

01/08/17, 13:56 - Amin: U sound sexist
01/08/17, 13:56 - Janith: The opposite I think
01/08/17, 13:57 - Amin: Nope, I dont think so 😂
01/08/17, 13:57 - Didier: Remind me to give it a read tomorrow Tahnee
01/08/17, 13:57 - Didier: What is the short story about though?
01/08/17, 13:57 - Amin: Hello janith
01/08/17, 13:57 - Didier: I accidentally read the last line and it seems cool
01/08/17, 13:57 - Janith: Hey Amin
01/08/17, 13:58 - Janith: What are we talking about?
01/08/17, 13:58 - Didier: I have a weakness for anything I imagine to be cool
01/08/17, 13:58 - Didier: Tahnee's short story
01/08/17, 13:58 - Janith: What's your criteria for something being cool?
01/08/17, 13:59 - Amin: A short story by tahnee
01/08/17, 13:59 - Didier: Something out of the norm and fun
01/08/17, 13:59 - Didier: For example,steampunk
01/08/17, 13:59 - Amin: No criterion
01/08/17, 13:59 - Didier: Cyberpunk
01/08/17, 13:59 - Didier: Dystopia
01/08/17, 13:59 - Tahnacious: Just about setting a scene and building tension, about animals.
01/08/17, 13:59 - Didier: Something u don't see in everyday life
01/08/17, 14:00 - Didier: And I can imagine a lot of cool features with
01/08/17, 14:00 - Tahnacious: To say more would be spoilerish
01/08/17, 14:00 - Didier: Kk
01/08/17, 14:00 - Didier: Will read it tmr 😄
01/08/17, 14:00 - Tahnacious: ;)
01/08/17, 14:01 - Amin: And sex
01/08/17, 14:01 - Amin: Is fun too
01/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: 😂
01/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Something not found in everyday life so
01/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Maybe ;)
01/08/17, 14:01 - Amin: 😂😂 depends on the person though
01/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Yep 😂
01/08/17, 14:01 - Tahnacious: Agreed
01/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Won't be cool for u anything
01/08/17, 14:02 - Didier: anymore*
01/08/17, 14:02 - Tahnacious: Also agreed. I have been with a dead fish before.
01/08/17, 14:02 - Didier: Because it's part of ur everyday life
01/08/17, 14:02 - Janith: I'll read it later too. I'm not really feeling like reading right now
01/08/17, 14:02 - Tahnacious: I wish it was part of my every day life
01/08/17, 14:02 - Amin: Sexual stuff still are
01/08/17, 14:02 - Amin: Hail brother
01/08/17, 14:03 - Tahnacious: Tired of fapping myself to sleep xD
01/08/17, 14:03 - Amin: Raw meet, yeah
01/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: Good for u 😉
01/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: It's a very effective way to make me sleep
01/08/17, 14:03 - Amin: No its not
01/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: If not I'll stay awake...
01/08/17, 14:03 - Amin: Suprised
01/08/17, 14:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah it feels kinds gross... Similar to what fucking an actual corpse would be like, I imagine
01/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: 😂
01/08/17, 14:04 - Tahnacious: *kinda
01/08/17, 14:04 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍
01/08/17, 14:04 - Amin: I girl or a boy?
01/08/17, 14:04 - Tahnacious: True me, if it was I'd find ways to change it up and keep it "cool"
01/08/17, 14:04 - Amin: Bad for you 😅
01/08/17, 14:04 - Didier: Some people like it:necrophilia
01/08/17, 14:04 - Tahnacious: I'm a girl but I use the word fap for either gender.
01/08/17, 14:05 - Tahnacious: 🤢
01/08/17, 14:05 - Amin: I wish I were there when you needed to sleep
01/08/17, 14:05 - Janith: Fucking a female corpse would just feel cold and damp
01/08/17, 14:05 - Amin: Hmmm, same wish again😂
01/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: 😂
01/08/17, 14:05 - Janith: A male corpse would be quite tricky to fuck
01/08/17, 14:05 - Tahnacious: Actually I hypothesise that there would be a lack of dampness and that's what would make it feel worse
01/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: Naughty Amin lol
01/08/17, 14:05 - Amin: Its nice
01/08/17, 14:05 - Tahnacious: Anyone wanna test my theory?! Lol
01/08/17, 14:06 - Janith: Oh yeah good point. There's nothing to keep it wet
01/08/17, 14:06 - Janith: @989306939802
01/08/17, 14:06 - Tahnacious: Lmao
01/08/17, 14:06 - Amin: U can warm the corp up first 😂😂😂
01/08/17, 14:06 - Tahnacious: Yeah chuck it on the heater like in this song
01/08/17, 14:06 - Didier: Yeah I think that might be true
01/08/17, 14:06 - Didier: Lol
01/08/17, 14:06 - Amin: Hard death would be needed
01/08/17, 14:06 - Janith: Get me a bunsen burner 😂
01/08/17, 14:07 - Tahnacious: https://youtu.be/VurhzANQ_B0
01/08/17, 14:07 - Amin: 😅
01/08/17, 14:07 - Tahnacious: One of my favourites actually
01/08/17, 14:07 - Amin: What theory?
01/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: HMM,I wonder
01/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: Now I'm curious 🤣
01/08/17, 14:07 - Janith: You'd probably have to use a bicycle pump to keep blood going into the penis to keep it erect
01/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: YES
01/08/17, 14:07 - Amin: I can make it wet with warm milk
01/08/17, 14:08 - Didier: I USED TO LISTEN TO THEM
01/08/17, 14:08 - Tahnacious: I have heard a story about morgue staff members being impregnated by corpses
01/08/17, 14:08 - Didier: I heard that their new songs aren't good anymore
01/08/17, 14:08 - Tahnacious: Haven't heard so I don't know
01/08/17, 14:08 - Janith: Though considering the tissue is decomposing you want to be careful or you could make it pop I guess
01/08/17, 14:08 - Janith: Howww???
01/08/17, 14:08 - Shaiju: There was something missing in between. It was good though!  I was trying to deduct the symbolism.. :)
01/08/17, 14:08 - Amin: 😂😂😂
01/08/17, 14:08 - Amin: I wish could have fucked
01/08/17, 14:08 - Didier: Nevrophilia?!
01/08/17, 14:09 - Tahnacious: http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-worker-arrested-after-giving-birth-to-a-dead-mans-baby/
01/08/17, 14:09 - Didier: Do u still listen to their new songs?
01/08/17, 14:09 - Amin: Nice,
01/08/17, 14:09 - Janith: Try explaining that to the grandparents 😂
01/08/17, 14:10 - Amin: The kid would be dead right?
01/08/17, 14:10 - Tahnacious: Basically it is kind of like the idea of natives being driven out and taken over by newcomers
01/08/17, 14:10 - Tahnacious: No, baby was born live
01/08/17, 14:11 - Amin: Alive u mean right?
01/08/17, 14:11 - Tahnacious: Nah I have trouble keeping in the loop sometimes
01/08/17, 14:11 - Janith: The things people do for sex 😂
01/08/17, 14:11 - Tahnacious: Same difference really
01/08/17, 14:12 - Amin: The things people do to sex actually in this particular case 😅
01/08/17, 14:12 - Janith: True.
01/08/17, 14:13 - Shaiju: Interesting! I thought there could be a switch between the prey and the huntress. At one time I thought that it's the cycle of life entrapped in the invincibility of death. :)
01/08/17, 14:15 - Shaiju: 😂
01/08/17, 14:19 - Amin: How old are u
01/08/17, 14:20 - Tahnacious: The prey was just young and waiting for protection
01/08/17, 14:20 - Tahnacious: Hunters become the hunted
01/08/17, 14:22 - Amin: And hardends become harder
01/08/17, 14:22 - Tahnacious: -.-
01/08/17, 14:22 - Amin: And harder
01/08/17, 14:23 - Tahnacious: Too hard is actually uncomfortable, just saying.
01/08/17, 14:23 - Shaiju: Was it  'xenophobia' the central theme of the story? Is it Trump the mother?😉
01/08/17, 14:23 - Tahnacious: Lol, this was originally written almost 10 years ago, before I knew trump existed
01/08/17, 14:24 - Tahnacious: In high school during class we were asked to write about something Australian, so I did this
01/08/17, 14:24 - Shaiju: You do time travel. Don't you?😂
01/08/17, 14:25 - Tahnacious: Wouldn't you like to know... 😉
01/08/17, 14:26 - Shaiju: Should I?😉
01/08/17, 14:28 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 14:28 - Tahnacious: Honestly, one day I probably will
01/08/17, 14:29 - Tahnacious: Before I die I want to time travel at least once
01/08/17, 14:30 - Tel: I wonder if, if they were killed facing downwards... I shouldn't finish this thought I think... 😂
01/08/17, 14:32 - Shaiju: Count me in!  But we can always transcend time ...  all we needed is to realise that it's just an illusion...all that we experience is just the manifestation of our own thoughts..
01/08/17, 14:34 - Tel: That's even more far out than the matrix
01/08/17, 14:34 - Tahnacious: Yeah it is only a labelled measurement
01/08/17, 14:34 - Tel: 'once you realise it's not a spoon, and it's both a melted spoon after being thrown away and a bit or iron ore ready to make this spoon, you will have transcended Neo..'
01/08/17, 14:35 - Tel: 🥄
01/08/17, 14:35 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 14:35 - Tahnacious: So hardcore
01/08/17, 14:35 - Shaiju: Matrix reloaded!😇
01/08/17, 14:36 - Tel: 😁 haven't seen that film in years. Must watch again. After I repeat LotR..
01/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: And harder
01/08/17, 14:39 - Shaiju: But what if you get addicted to it? Repeat it just before death in an endless loop?
01/08/17, 14:39 - Didier: What is it about?Always hear it but never watched
01/08/17, 14:40 - Tahnacious: If my consciousness hasn't been uploaded to a computer yet, sure.
01/08/17, 14:41 - Didier: I will just live in that era lol.I will travel to the future(this seems like it might be fun),not to the past (this is kind of sad)
01/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: And harder
01/08/17, 14:41 - Tahnacious: Are you hard right now -.-
01/08/17, 14:41 - Didier: 😂
01/08/17, 14:42 - Amin: Are u curious?
01/08/17, 14:42 - Tahnacious: I would travel to the past to meet my ancestors and witness interesting events. Not to chance my life
01/08/17, 14:42 - Shaiju: The future is without you! If not that's not future because you might have dead already? Isn't it?
01/08/17, 14:42 - Didier: Living in the past is scary that's why I don't want to travel to the past (to my past at least).If I were to travel to the past,it will be the earlier times because I love history and vintage items.
01/08/17, 14:43 - Tahnacious: No, but you seem to be rambling on about it
01/08/17, 14:43 - Amin: Why do u care then?
01/08/17, 14:43 - Tahnacious: Because it is getting irritating
01/08/17, 14:44 - Amin: Can u feel it?
01/08/17, 14:44 - Tahnacious: Oh god no
01/08/17, 14:44 - Tahnacious: I'm out

01/08/17, 14:44 - Amin: Mission accomplished

01/08/17, 14:45 - Amin: But I never irritate u

01/08/17, 15:27 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 15:30 - Janith: The fact that it exists like that is proof that most don't read it
01/08/17, 15:31 - Tel: You don't have an option to not agree though. USA government for you..
01/08/17, 15:32 - Janith: The land of the "free"
01/08/17, 15:34 - Tel: Indeed
01/08/17, 17:05 - Infected: I attempted to write a romance novel. I got 3 chapters in and got bored with it.
01/08/17, 17:21 - Tahnacious: Only 2 hours apart from me
01/08/17, 17:23 - Tahnacious: I've tried romance too, didn't get very far
01/08/17, 17:53 - Infected: It was a novel about the history of the rh factor and the religious beliefs/ conspiracy theories behind it. I threw in the romance because it's a popular genre but I am unable to write the romantic experience authentically.
01/08/17, 17:54 - Tahnacious: That's a shame, sounds interesting.
01/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: It's probably still on Wattpad
01/08/17, 17:54 - Tahnacious: Guys... I'm looking for ideas for a business name for making kitchens. I can only think of silly ones.
01/08/17, 17:55 - Tahnacious: So everyone throw a few ideas out there
01/08/17, 17:55 - Tahnacious: Intp room... This should be easy lol
01/08/17, 17:55 - Infected: Making kitchens or designing and installing kitchens?
01/08/17, 17:56 - Tahnacious: Designing and installing
01/08/17, 17:56 - Tahnacious: Cabinets and such
01/08/17, 17:57 - Infected: I assume you want something inventive but still to the point. Have you considered puns?
01/08/17, 17:57 - Tahnacious: Yeah something punny works
01/08/17, 17:58 - Maureen: there would be a "kitchen" pun in german
01/08/17, 17:58 - Tahnacious: Yeah?
01/08/17, 17:58 - Maureen: "Kitchen" is a colloquial word for "prison"
01/08/17, 17:59 - Maureen: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 17:59 - Infected: I like that.
01/08/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Also they're Mexican
01/08/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Their old business name was duramex
01/08/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 17:59 - Tahnacious: But they need a new one cuz that went bust
01/08/17, 18:00 - Infected: "The bowls of Hell"
01/08/17, 18:00 - Infected: Heh.
01/08/17, 18:00 - Tahnacious: That's cool, didn't know that
01/08/17, 18:00 - Maureen: durex are condoms over here 😂
01/08/17, 18:00 - Tel: What's your USP @61477394075?
01/08/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: What's a USP?
01/08/17, 18:01 - Tel: Unique selling point
01/08/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: Ohhh
01/08/17, 18:01 - Infected: There are a lot of kitchen design companies.
01/08/17, 18:01 - Tel: Not many females in your business if your installing too, I imagine
01/08/17, 18:01 - Tahnacious: Umm I guess that they take their time to make quality products. Not that unique. They've been in the industry so long so they know their shit
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'd be helping but I daresay I'd be mostly delegated paperwork
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tel: Ah, sorry - misread. Someone else's company?
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tel: Mexican. K. Will restart :p
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tel: Working in Aus?
01/08/17, 18:02 - Tahnacious: Not mine but I'm involved so they're all idea brainstorming and want a name within the first few hours
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: It is in USA
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: Hence why I'm only kind of involved
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tel: Ah! You're the international partner!
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tel: Haha
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: Otherwise sure it would be mine
01/08/17, 18:03 - Infected: I would try to come up with a name that reflects the experience of the business but is also catchy. People love earworms.
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tel: Exactly
01/08/17, 18:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm hoping to find something like that
01/08/17, 18:03 - Maureen: I would use the word "cocina" instead of "kitchen"
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: OK, that's a start
01/08/17, 18:04 - Infected: What area of the United States is the business located?
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: Cocina creations?
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tel: This
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: California
01/08/17, 18:04 - Tahnacious: San Fernando valley
01/08/17, 18:04 - Maureen: something that rhymes maybe?
01/08/17, 18:05 - Infected: Cocina Creations would work but I don't think it hits the mark.
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: I like alliteration but rhyming is good too
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tel: Target audience? Are there lots of Mexicans, or target =?
01/08/17, 18:05 - Maureen: both 🙂
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: Target = rich people who want decent non-Chinese kitchens
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: Something that isn't going to fall apart
01/08/17, 18:05 - Maureen: cocina california
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: Oooo
01/08/17, 18:05 - Tahnacious: That could work
01/08/17, 18:06 - Infected: You need to know the particular demographic that buys from this business and find a way to expand it to other demographics.
01/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: Yup
01/08/17, 18:07 - Infected: There is a limit to rich white old guys that buy new kitchens for their wives to impress their friends with.
01/08/17, 18:08 - Tahnacious: The business is only 3 men working it isn't like they're going to be doing hundreds
01/08/17, 18:08 - Tel: Well, biggest part of the market, I'd guess, is the middle range kitchens.. Sturdy and nice, but not show boatyard or flimsy
01/08/17, 18:08 - Tahnacious: Maybe 1-2 every fortnight
01/08/17, 18:08 - Tel: In terms of profit.. (pure guessing though)
01/08/17, 18:08 - Infected: The point of a business is to make it successful.
01/08/17, 18:09 - Infected: It's a family business, I assume. Those are on the downturn in the u.s. We have Lowes, Home Depot, and many online kitchen consultation outlets with Keypoint locations.
01/08/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: True but one guy is in his 70s and only doing it because he hates being retired
01/08/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: The other two just need decent money
01/08/17, 18:10 - Tahnacious: They earn maybe $10000 per kitchen they do and divy it up equally because they're family
01/08/17, 18:11 - Tahnacious: What they want to avoid is being staff paid only $15 an hour for quality work
01/08/17, 18:11 - Tahnacious: So they are starting up a business again
01/08/17, 18:11 - Tel: Earn as in profit? That seems a decent margin, pending on time spent I guess
01/08/17, 18:11 - Tahnacious: 1-2 weeks
01/08/17, 18:11 - Infected: A hobby business isn't likely to attract a wide variety of customers.
01/08/17, 18:11 - Tahnacious: Yeah they generally each take home $3000 a fortnight doing it
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tel: So 6 weeks total labour if 3 ppl. Fair enough.
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tel: Up to*
01/08/17, 18:12 - Infected: You need to make it more appealing than mainstream companies.
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tel: Hm, not helping with the name now and instead analysing the business.. Lol
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah they don't need many jobs to be self sufficient
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tel: Good ol' INTPs. Never following the rules of the game..
01/08/17, 18:12 - Tahnacious: Yuuup
01/08/17, 18:13 - Infected: I don't think we can help it, to be fair.
01/08/17, 18:13 - Tahnacious: That's OK, I figured idea generation would happen better here than elsewhere
01/08/17, 18:13 - Maureen: no 😂
too invested already
01/08/17, 18:13 - Tel: I couldn't come up with anything on the info given. I shortened cocina California to Cali's Cocis, but doubt that makes any sense
01/08/17, 18:14 - Tahnacious: No, I don't mind it
01/08/17, 18:14 - Tel: Was going for alliteration and assonance at the expenditure of comprehension :)
01/08/17, 18:15 - Infected: It doesn't seem like a name people would take seriously.
01/08/17, 18:16 - Tel: Indeedy. This game reminds me of when my sis started an electrical company.. I came up with the name elec-chicks
01/08/17, 18:16 - Tel: 😁
01/08/17, 18:16 - Tel: Then turned out someone else already had it. Rather annoying.
01/08/17, 18:16 - Infected: That, I actually like.
01/08/17, 18:17 - Tel: @61477394075 - need more Ne input for Ti cogitation
01/08/17, 18:17 - Tel: Names of ppl involved? Any particular specialties? Any local towns they're in, or other info that could be used in a name?
01/08/17, 18:18 - Tel: Ne / Si anyway
01/08/17, 18:18 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 18:19 - Tel: Perhaps we should shower..
01/08/17, 18:20 - Infected: Example:

Salvador's California Cocina 

Creating finely crafted kitchens since xx
01/08/17, 18:20 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
01/08/17, 18:20 - Tahnacious: Very cute
01/08/17, 18:21 - Tahnacious: They live in Canoga Park but they work in another suburb of the valley
01/08/17, 18:21 - Tahnacious: Last name is Saucedo
01/08/17, 18:21 - Infected: These are hipster names. They would work if your target audience was younger.
01/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: Conoga's Cucina's has nice assonance
01/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: And same syllables
01/08/17, 18:22 - Infected: It flows.
01/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: Agreed. Useful for inspiration I thought
01/08/17, 18:22 - Infected: You could do a word play on "sauce" with the name.
01/08/17, 18:23 - Tahnacious: Lol @ counter productive
01/08/17, 18:23 - Tel: Oh wow. That's gta be it..
01/08/17, 18:23 - Tel: My fave too!
01/08/17, 18:24 - Infected: I find counter productiveness to be very productive. It just takes longer than getting right to it. Who makes a decision based upon singular factors?
01/08/17, 18:25 - Tel: Exactly. Just others think you're lazy or indecisive because you're taking more info in. Lack of understanding
01/08/17, 18:25 - Tahnacious: Unfortunately it gives off the air that they sit around not doing anything at all. Given the business owner is an INFP it probably isn't the ideal route
01/08/17, 18:26 - Infected: In marketing, people aren't going to just list names of kitchen companies. They're going to ask questions and do research.
01/08/17, 18:26 - Tel: V thoughtful of you!
01/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: I find someone who researches all angles to be more professional than someone who just spouts word vomit.
01/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: Yea, but we're the minority
01/08/17, 18:27 - Tahnacious: Yeah
01/08/17, 18:28 - Infected: Ideas are serious things and should be considered. It's irresponsible to just say something without thinking about it.
01/08/17, 18:28 - Tel: Ppl like verbal diarrhoea.. Or at least are persuaded by it
01/08/17, 18:28 - Tahnacious: I mean they're just gonna come up with something lame without any help
01/08/17, 18:28 - Tel: Lol
01/08/17, 18:28 - Tel: Such belief you have in them.. :p
01/08/17, 18:28 - Tel: Hm, perhaps you should think logically
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tel: Like, a name starting with A would be at the top of an alphabetical list of companies..
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tel: So where are they advertising? Any type of ordering?
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: Pretty sure the other two guys are ST types so.... Ya little imagination there
01/08/17, 18:29 - Infected: "A Taste of Saucedo"
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: I'd guess the dad is istj
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: Ooooo ;)
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 18:29 - Tahnacious: Sounds dirty
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Lol!!!
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: I didn't think that until you said it
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tahnacious: "Taste my sauce"
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 18:30 - Infected: Really?
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Naughty @61477394075!
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Yes. Totally
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Well, now that she said it
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tahnacious: 😁
01/08/17, 18:30 - Tahnacious: I have a habit of doing that
01/08/17, 18:31 - Tahnacious: My previous ideas revolved around 3 men having hard wood
01/08/17, 18:31 - Tel: Lol.
01/08/17, 18:31 - Infected: I was playing more towards the experience of the owner and that he has better ability to craft something desirable than a standard hardware store.
01/08/17, 18:32 - Infected: Back to the drawing board.
01/08/17, 18:32 - Maureen: 😂😂😂
01/08/17, 18:33 - Maureen: 🍆
01/08/17, 18:33 - Maureen: wait: 🏏
01/08/17, 18:33 - Tahnacious: Oh, I knew the intention and appreciate the thought, just saw the humour behind it
01/08/17, 18:35 - Infected: So, we want it to start with "A" if possible, reflect the experience of the owner, hit the target demographic,  and be witty.
01/08/17, 18:36 - Tahnacious: Well their next installation is in Beverly hills if that gives you an idea of the people that are ordering kitchens
01/08/17, 18:36 - Tel: Rich, basically
01/08/17, 18:36 - Tahnacious: Yup
01/08/17, 18:36 - Tel: So classy over witty?
01/08/17, 18:36 - Infected: Rich people don't like wit, in my experience.
01/08/17, 18:37 - Tahnacious: I don't mind wit either way but try middle ground?
01/08/17, 18:37 - Tel: And drop the Mexican? I'm prejudicing the clientele will be prejudicing the company if Mexican...
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tahnacious: Possibly, I think they're common in the area
01/08/17, 18:38 - Infected: A possibility
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tahnacious: But their previous name was Duramex
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Idano what that means
01/08/17, 18:38 - Infected: Durable Mexican
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Mexican I'm prwauming
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Presuming*
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Ah k
01/08/17, 18:38 - Tahnacious: Yeah
01/08/17, 18:39 - Infected: *snort*

Duracal
01/08/17, 18:39 - Tel: I need to hit the sack. I'll think over my sleep
01/08/17, 18:39 - Tel: Lol
01/08/17, 18:39 - Tel: Start a brand that way
01/08/17, 18:39 - Tahnacious: Lol ok
01/08/17, 18:40 - Infected: Good idea

01/08/17, 19:39 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: Hi @94754191589 and @Fabio

01/08/17, 19:42 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: This is my mom's phone
01/08/17, 19:42 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: Anyways
01/08/17, 19:43 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: Don't look at her profile picture
01/08/17, 19:43 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: You will be flooded with rage
01/08/17, 19:44 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: It is indeed, a truly disturbing picture
01/08/17, 19:46 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: They took my phone away for not complying with what social convention dictates
01/08/17, 19:48 - Circle: Wow . What does socisl convention dictate in your case
01/08/17, 19:49 - Circle: Social *
01/08/17, 19:54 - Tahnacious: My parents used to "discipline" me in a similar way
01/08/17, 19:55 - Circle: Im still confused as to what exactly was done to go against social convention and how would they have found out ?
01/08/17, 19:56 - Tahnacious: Well for me it was not wanting to leave the house
01/08/17, 19:56 - Tahnacious: Or stuff like that
01/08/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: "Antisocial" behaviour
01/08/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: Playing too many video games
01/08/17, 19:57 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: Well, are you aware of the "rule" that dictates that a man must carry heavy objects for the women, open the door etc..?
01/08/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: "It is bad for you, I'm unplugging your n64 and taking the cords away. Go play outside like a normal kid"
01/08/17, 19:57 - Circle: Oh right , haha yes completly understand
01/08/17, 19:57 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: Been there.
01/08/17, 19:58 - Tahnacious: I don't really consider it a rule. I do all the heavy lifting etc myself
01/08/17, 19:58 - Tahnacious: If a man offers to help I humbly accept and split the load in half.
01/08/17, 19:58 - Tahnacious: He says I can take all of it. I say it's OK, I got it.
01/08/17, 19:58 - Circle: Social convention changes in different cultures i just wanted to know exactly what you did in this case .
01/08/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: My mum once disciplined me for losing her cookies
01/08/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: She lost her cookies and assumed I ate them
01/08/17, 19:59 - Circle: Did you eat them ?
01/08/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: Not at all
01/08/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: Didn't even know they existed
01/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: So when I got all my toys confiscated for a week... Then she found them in her cupboard...
01/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: It was the penultimate "I told you so"
01/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: Now gimme my fucking shit back, you bitch
01/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: (I wish I could've said that)
01/08/17, 20:01 - Circle: I bet you thought about it again and again trying to figure out what happened
01/08/17, 20:01 - Circle: LOL
01/08/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: Yeah I did >_<
01/08/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: I was like well I didn't take them so what happened? How can I prove it wasn't my fault?
01/08/17, 20:02 - Circle: I still have to refrain from saying i told you so . People really cant stand being told so
01/08/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: Hahah
01/08/17, 20:03 - Tahnacious: I usually refrain, it is just implied by my expression, or I'm thinking it silently
01/08/17, 20:03 - Circle: Wow i didnt realise how similar intp's really are . (First chat with one lol)
01/08/17, 20:04 - Tahnacious: My enfp ex used to say the worst thing about me was that I was "always right"
01/08/17, 20:04 - Tahnacious: Oh, OK haha
01/08/17, 20:04 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it is pleasant
01/08/17, 20:05 - Didier: I agree...
01/08/17, 20:05 - Circle: Hahaha . Im actually working really hard to stop saying i told you so (without actually saying it)
01/08/17, 20:06 - Circle: Everyone i know hates that about me too ! My husband takes it as a personal attack on his intelligence.  And theres just no amount of reassurance
01/08/17, 20:07 - Didier: Well my "friend" always said it to me -.- Not like I didn't know in my case,I just don't want to do it
01/08/17, 20:07 - Didier: But yeah I never say it in the end
01/08/17, 20:07 - Didier: 😂
01/08/17, 20:08 - Circle: Do you guys ever feel like people try so hard to prove you wrong ? Personally i try never saying anything wrong (thanks to google) which just gets on peoples nerves to no end 😞
01/08/17, 20:08 - Didier: It's always in my mind but I resteain myself from saying it
01/08/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: I think people try, I pull up an article that says otherwise and then they go... "Oh..."
01/08/17, 20:09 - Circle: Hahaha i dont say it either because i dont want to be punched . But they always know im saying it regardless
01/08/17, 20:09 - Tahnacious: I kind of love that expression
01/08/17, 20:10 - Didier: Yep
01/08/17, 20:11 - Circle: Its really annoying , i have to let people "win" occasionally just so i can force them to understand a separate point
01/08/17, 20:11 - Tahnacious: People are yet to hit me for being right 😁
01/08/17, 20:12 - Didier: Yeah I understand
01/08/17, 20:12 - Didier: Mine is so that I don't get hated and get an easier life
01/08/17, 20:12 - Didier: Those people are hard to deal with
01/08/17, 20:12 - Circle: Or do you guys ever have to word things in ways so people think they are coming to the conclusion themselves just so that they wont try disagreeing with your point just for the sake of it
01/08/17, 20:12 - Didier: They don't know I'm thinking about it tho
01/08/17, 20:13 - Didier: Yeah kinda
01/08/17, 20:15 - Circle: I feel like i have to do this all the time, thats actually why i went out of my way to find some INTP types online. I feel at the end of my tether , theres only so much explaining i can do
01/08/17, 20:15 - Circle: (Not trying to be arrogant just frustrated)
01/08/17, 20:19 - Circle: But to be honest i blame myself as my social circle is mainly people witb little to no formal education . I blame my self for also not having a formal education, making it much harder to have any mentally stimulating conversations at work or at home
01/08/17, 20:20 - Tahnacious: Frequently
01/08/17, 20:20 - Tahnacious: Doesn't come across as arrogant to me. I can relate.
01/08/17, 20:21 - Circle: 😃
01/08/17, 20:21 - Lulu: Heeeyy
01/08/17, 20:21 - Tahnacious: My only intelligent friend is an ENTP and he is hard to deal with because he's at least 90% batshit crazy. Good in small doses though
01/08/17, 20:22 - Tahnacious: Also he has a crush on me and that wards me off a little
01/08/17, 20:23 - Circle: When i was younger i faked being an entp , but the older im getting the more introverted im brcoming just cant deal with people
01/08/17, 20:23 - Circle: Do you feel flattered ?
01/08/17, 20:24 - Circle: Hi lulu
01/08/17, 20:24 - Lulu: I just went with the flow tbh
01/08/17, 20:24 - Lulu: Hello
01/08/17, 20:24 - Lulu: Although I have this one memory on the park that stands out
01/08/17, 20:25 - Tahnacious: Sort of, I guess. I'm used to people having crushes on me but I won't date them for one reason or another
01/08/17, 20:25 - Didier: We know haha
01/08/17, 20:26 - Circle: Are you currently in a relationship ?
01/08/17, 20:26 - Lulu: I was at the park and you know little kids socializing and all that stuff, I tried to say hi to these two little girls, they had a big my little pony doll , they said they didn't wanna be friends for whatever reason I forget so I wandered along alone and saw flowers little ones and then I brought the flowers to the girls to fake feed the pony and then they hung out with me
01/08/17, 20:27 - Lulu: I was like 5 or younger
01/08/17, 20:29 - Circle: Lulu i just joined so im not sure if your replying to a conversation i havent seen , but kudos to your quick thinking. I cant seem to remember anything from 5 or below
01/08/17, 20:29 - Tahnacious: Sort of online dating I guess, if you count that
01/08/17, 20:29 - Lulu: They were cunts thinking back, all stuck up
01/08/17, 20:30 - Circle: Im not trying it with you lol im just wondering if other intps have dound their "soulmate"
01/08/17, 20:30 - Lulu: Replying to this kinda? But also not really I guess I wasn't faking just seeking companionship
01/08/17, 20:30 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah cunts were the only social option for me growing up.
01/08/17, 20:31 - Tahnacious: I don't think anyone else here is married but I could be wrong.
01/08/17, 20:32 - Lulu: I mean I never really engaged that type of company as I aged, I'd rather had been alone
01/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: The person I talk to online is a decent candidate, I'm just unsure if it would work out in real life.
01/08/17, 20:32 - Circle: Ohh i get it , yes i did my fair share of trying to fit in (which i did with any group because i observed what they acted like then emulated or did one up) but it was never  fulfilling friendships
01/08/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: Pretty much this, yes. After a while I gave up and just enjoyed being alone
01/08/17, 20:34 - Circle: Same here partly because ive become lazier and can no longer bother to put the effort in for forming new friendships im comfortable with being alone
01/08/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: This ^^^ lol
01/08/17, 20:36 - Circle: One more question ive often wondered whether this is an intp trait or just me , loyalty and trust is incredibly important to me in any relation ship doess this resonate with any of you ?
01/08/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: I feel it is important. Kind of a deal breaker when it is broken.
01/08/17, 20:38 - Circle: Oddly i take it very personally if i am betrayed even with the smallest of things but it could be because i have major trust issues
01/08/17, 20:39 - Lulu: If someone does something serious to me they are out lol
01/08/17, 20:39 - Lulu: Gladly it hasn't happened to me
01/08/17, 20:40 - Lulu: I don't really get bothered easily, if someone makes me upset like truly upset that means they did something
01/08/17, 20:40 - Lulu: Baaad lol
01/08/17, 20:40 - Tahnacious: I've been cheated on before
01/08/17, 20:41 - Lulu: Bam they out
01/08/17, 20:41 - Tahnacious: Wasn't a happy chappy. Dumped him.
01/08/17, 20:41 - Circle: Ahah i see , im generally quite laid back i only feel this way if its with someone i trusted
01/08/17, 20:42 - Tahnacious: I also considered the relationship over as soon as my other enfp ex suggested having an open relationship
01/08/17, 20:42 - Tahnacious: To me that's essentially "I love you and I don't want to dump you... Buuuuut I wanna fuck other people
01/08/17, 20:42 - Circle: Awhh man ive never been cheated on but i think i would be so offended
01/08/17, 20:43 - Circle: Im egotistical like that im fine with an open relationship as long as im the most important LOL
01/08/17, 20:43 - Tahnacious: The crux of enfps is always thinking maybe the grass is greener. It wasn't. He came back to me in tears and I was like lol nope
01/08/17, 20:44 - Tahnacious: Oh, I tried it out for a bit to amuse him
01/08/17, 20:44 - Tahnacious: And right at the point where he realised not only was I the best he was gonna get, I was probably out of his league to start with... I dumped him
01/08/17, 20:44 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 20:44 - Tahnacious: I'm so mean.
01/08/17, 20:45 - Tahnacious: And he was kind of upset at how easily I was able to get attention
01/08/17, 20:45 - Circle: Is it not difficult being with an extrovert ? I couldnt imagine having to be social because the other half wants to
01/08/17, 20:45 - Tahnacious: As soon as I was like "I'm totes available for sex" how badly I was swarmed lol
01/08/17, 20:45 - Tahnacious: Yeah I hated it haha
01/08/17, 20:46 - Tahnacious: He pretty much skipped the Fi and was in a constant Ne Te loop
01/08/17, 20:46 - Tahnacious: Which was embarrassing as fuck because his Te was SO BAD
01/08/17, 20:46 - Circle: Hahahaha i know exactly what you are talking about , you dumped him at the perfect time
01/08/17, 20:46 - Tahnacious: 😉
01/08/17, 20:48 - Circle: I kinda wish my partner was smarter than me , i dont really believe in "love" but i do believe in dependency and compatibility with time as the variable
01/08/17, 20:49 - Tahnacious: I don't really want someone smarter than me, just smart enough to keep up with me
01/08/17, 20:49 - Circle: True
01/08/17, 20:50 - Tahnacious: If someone is smarter than me I go "oh holy shit, what even is this?" I feel like I lose my meaning and am intimidated... Lol
01/08/17, 20:50 - Circle: Why i say smarter is because i dont think he can hack knowing that im right most of the time . Whereas i dont mind doing the learning
01/08/17, 20:51 - Circle: 9gag?
01/08/17, 20:51 - Circle: But you dont mind others being intimidated by you ?
01/08/17, 20:51 - Tahnacious: Actually I find that if someone is smart but without taking pride in their intellect that's the best balance for a partner because they don't mind listening to you but at the same time you can discuss anything
01/08/17, 20:51 - Tahnacious: 😉 not at all
01/08/17, 20:52 - Tahnacious: Honestly if they're the average person they probably don't really know if I'm smart or not anyway. It is only the above average that have any significant reaction.
01/08/17, 20:52 - Tahnacious: I don't go about showing it off either. Usually I just keep it to myself
01/08/17, 20:52 - Circle: Perhaps , i dont mean academically smarter but perhaps more intellectual than i
01/08/17, 20:53 - Tahnacious: A general air that similar minded individuals can pick up on
01/08/17, 20:53 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it doesn't have to be "book smarts"
01/08/17, 20:53 - Circle: Where are you finding these similar minded people ive been looking for them all my life hah
01/08/17, 20:54 - Tahnacious: Just find N types, it is the easiest place to start haha
01/08/17, 20:54 - Tahnacious: Usually comic book stores and gaming areas
01/08/17, 20:54 - Tahnacious: Maybe a library
01/08/17, 20:55 - Circle: Here in the uk in my town there isnt any comic book stores or gaming areas 😩
01/08/17, 20:55 - Tahnacious: Or at university
01/08/17, 20:55 - Tahnacious: That has been the tightest gathering of like minded individuals I've ever found
01/08/17, 20:55 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬ saiu
01/08/17, 20:55 - Tahnacious: That sucks haha
01/08/17, 20:55 - Tahnacious: How do people play dungeons and dragons over there?!
01/08/17, 20:56 - Circle: Dont see anyone but very old people and children at librarys . As for university before i dropped out i was very disappointed couldnt find a similar soul
01/08/17, 20:56 - Tahnacious: But yeah, I'm doing a bachelor of animation, so easy to get along with everyone in my classes. They all use Ne
01/08/17, 20:56 - Tahnacious: You'd find me in a library hah
01/08/17, 20:57 - Circle: Ive never met anyone that plays dungeon and dragons in real life . In fact majority of people in my area consider that as part of an american subculture
01/08/17, 20:57 - Tahnacious: Pssssh
01/08/17, 20:57 - Tahnacious: I'm not american and I play it. It is great :)
01/08/17, 20:58 - Circle: Where are you from ?
01/08/17, 20:58 - Tahnacious: Australia
01/08/17, 20:58 - Circle: Have you ever been to the uk ?
01/08/17, 20:58 - Tahnacious: I lived in the UK for 2 years though
01/08/17, 20:58 - Tahnacious: ^
01/08/17, 20:58 - Circle: Where ?
01/08/17, 20:58 - Tahnacious: Reading, Crawley, Durham
01/08/17, 20:58 - Tahnacious: Mostly
01/08/17, 20:58 - Circle: Other than london i cant think of anywhere with even half decent subcultures
01/08/17, 20:59 - Tahnacious: Well to me england is so small it isn't a hassle to get to London haha
01/08/17, 20:59 - Circle: I went to university in london 😔
01/08/17, 20:59 - Tahnacious: Assuming you live anywhere in England...
01/08/17, 20:59 - Tahnacious: I travel 4-5 hours to work
01/08/17, 20:59 - Tahnacious: And then another 4-5 back again
01/08/17, 20:59 - Circle: Omg wow do you commute daily
01/08/17, 21:00 - Circle: Shit
01/08/17, 21:00 - Circle: Must be a long ass day
01/08/17, 21:00 - Tahnacious: Not every day, my work doesn't give me regular shifts :(
01/08/17, 21:00 - Tahnacious: Yes it is...
01/08/17, 21:00 - Tahnacious: But when I do work I make $230 a day :)
01/08/17, 21:00 - Circle: I work 12 hour shifts so theres no way im comuting that far
01/08/17, 21:00 - Tahnacious: Haha so do I
01/08/17, 21:00 - Tahnacious: 6am-6pm
01/08/17, 21:01 - Circle: Omg what are you?
01/08/17, 21:01 - Tahnacious: Hahaha
01/08/17, 21:01 - Circle: I must have 8 hours sleep
01/08/17, 21:01 - Tahnacious: A zombie
01/08/17, 21:01 - Tahnacious: I wish I did. I live on 1 or 2 frequently
01/08/17, 21:01 - Tahnacious: I am constantly very deprived
01/08/17, 21:02 - Circle: Ive always wanted to go to australia but i keep reading this articles about the insects in Australia so its really put me off
01/08/17, 21:02 - Tahnacious: Eh
01/08/17, 21:02 - Tahnacious: Its no big deal but the flies in the summer can get annoying
01/08/17, 21:02 - Tahnacious: If you're not used to it
01/08/17, 21:02 - Circle: I dont know how you do it but i have admiration for you !
01/08/17, 21:02 - Tahnacious: Haha
01/08/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: The struggle is real.
01/08/17, 21:03 - Circle: The snakes giant lizards and giant spiders . No thanks
01/08/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: Do whatever it takes to have enough money to get by. Simples
01/08/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: Nah
01/08/17, 21:03 - Circle: What do you do if you dont mind me asking
01/08/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: There's none of that really lol
01/08/17, 21:03 - Tahnacious: Retail xD so its shitty and I hate it
01/08/17, 21:04 - Tahnacious: All that crap is just made up to out tourists off
01/08/17, 21:04 - Circle: Do you work on the sales floor or offices
01/08/17, 21:04 - Tahnacious: We used to have a thing called white Australia policy, after that became abolished people had to get inventive
01/08/17, 21:05 - Tahnacious: Sales, I run a shop from open to close by myself.
01/08/17, 21:05 - Circle: Hahaha
01/08/17, 21:05 - Circle: Hard work
01/08/17, 21:05 - Tahnacious: It is actually real, we have nothing that other countries don't have in similar amounts
01/08/17, 21:05 - Circle: I just sit in an office all day bored out of my head
01/08/17, 21:05 - Tahnacious: We have no land predators
01/08/17, 21:05 - Tahnacious: No one has died of a spider bite in 36 years or so which is better than most countries
01/08/17, 21:06 - Tahnacious: One poisonous spider really exists, the next most venomous is the black widow which everywhere else has anyway
01/08/17, 21:06 - Tahnacious: So I don't get the big deal lol
01/08/17, 21:06 - Circle: Have you seen the video of an ausie fighting a kangaroo ? Man i luv gettin all these stereotypes out the way
01/08/17, 21:06 - Tahnacious: I've never seen the poisonous one and I'm supposed to live in the small area it exists
01/08/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: Haha
01/08/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: Kangaroos are like deer
01/08/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: They're dumb and they accidentally jump out at cars
01/08/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: If you fucked with one it would probably try to run away but if it was a male then it would probably rip you a new one.
01/08/17, 21:07 - Tahnacious: Just. Like. Deer
01/08/17, 21:08 - Circle: Why do you work so far ?
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: They hop, that's the only difference
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: Because I moved house and haven't gotten a new job yet
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: Loyalty to my job
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: Etc
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: They kinda need me. I'm their only employee
01/08/17, 21:08 - Tahnacious: And when I do work I get paid enough
01/08/17, 21:10 - Circle: Atleast you get paid enough to last you i make £96 a day so its tough to get by
01/08/17, 21:10 - Tahnacious: Yeah I moved further away because rent is cheaper outside Sydney
01/08/17, 21:11 - Circle: Ive always fantasized about living in a big country where i could buy a plot and build my own house with a little farm snd my own energy , its the dream
01/08/17, 21:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I'd love to do that...
01/08/17, 21:12 - Tahnacious: When my parents die I'll be able to. They own 100 acres
01/08/17, 21:12 - Tahnacious: Subdivide it, sell part of it and build a house on the other part... Lol
01/08/17, 21:12 - Circle: Thats awesome !
01/08/17, 21:13 - Circle: Is it away from people? I like privacy
01/08/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: Very much so
01/08/17, 21:13 - Circle: Theres not much privacy in the uk az you probably know
01/08/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: In the middle of nowhere in the mountains with a river around it
01/08/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: Almost an island
01/08/17, 21:13 - Circle: Your living the life !
01/08/17, 21:13 - Tahnacious: Lol
01/08/17, 21:13 - Circle: How old r u ?
01/08/17, 21:14 - Tahnacious: You mean I'll live the life when I retire...
01/08/17, 21:14 - Tahnacious: I'm 25
01/08/17, 21:14 - Tahnacious: My parents are 67 though
01/08/17, 21:15 - Circle: Just knowing i will eventually have that would give me enough material to imagine my life all the way untill retirement lol
01/08/17, 21:15 - Tahnacious: They actually own multiple houses. I'm living in one I'm renting from them currently
01/08/17, 21:15 - Circle: Im 26 my parents are 70 !
01/08/17, 21:15 - Tahnacious: Hah yeah
01/08/17, 21:15 - Tahnacious: Haha nice
01/08/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: Hardly anyone has parents near my parents age
01/08/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: My parents were born a week apart... Lol
01/08/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: Same year
01/08/17, 21:16 - Tahnacious: 1950
01/08/17, 21:16 - Circle: Same here
01/08/17, 21:17 - Circle: Thats great you can do them a joint a party
01/08/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: I'm an only child because my mum went through menopause after she had me
01/08/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: Haha yeah ;)
01/08/17, 21:17 - Circle: Yeah they told my mom to abort me because she was so old that i was most likely to be severly disabled
01/08/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: Psssh
01/08/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: Silly doctors
01/08/17, 21:18 - Circle: Yeah my dad apparently had a field day showing me off to the doctor
01/08/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: I'd only abort if it were actually comfirmed
01/08/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: Lol yeah xD
01/08/17, 21:18 - Tahnacious: I bet
01/08/17, 21:19 - Circle: Same
01/08/17, 21:19 - Circle: I dont think i could hack a  mentally disabled child sadly . Im far to selfish
01/08/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: Like "uhhh good news your kid is currently alive, bad news he has a tumour the size of a football on his back"
01/08/17, 21:19 - Tahnacious: me either
01/08/17, 21:20 - Tahnacious: It isn't just selfishness it is to protect everyone involved
01/08/17, 21:20 - Circle: Ahhhhh savage your hilarious
01/08/17, 21:20 - Tahnacious: The child themselves, if capable wouldn't wish that upon themselves
01/08/17, 21:20 - Circle: Not just protect everyone but also the child doesnt deserve that life
01/08/17, 21:21 - Tahnacious: And the father, close family, friends, financial resources, tax money taken for the child's wellbeing.... It isn't fair on anyone imo
01/08/17, 21:21 - Circle: LOOOL
01/08/17, 21:21 - Tahnacious: Hahah
01/08/17, 21:21 - Tahnacious: Proud savage here
01/08/17, 21:22 - Circle: Wow i had no idea that other people thought the same way most people go crazy when o say something like that
01/08/17, 21:22 - Tahnacious: But yeah if someone told me uhhh you can either be born with downs syndrome or you can just die before you're born I would be like DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW, PLEASEEE
01/08/17, 21:22 - Tahnacious: maybe it is an INTP thing, not sure.
01/08/17, 21:22 - Circle: Same i wouldnt want that
01/08/17, 21:22 - Tahnacious: Most people get offended when I bring it up 😁
01/08/17, 21:22 - Circle: Im not sure but i know that people think im insensitive
01/08/17, 21:23 - Tahnacious: Fuck em
01/08/17, 21:23 - Circle: Haha
01/08/17, 21:23 - Tahnacious: that's all I have to say
01/08/17, 21:23 - Circle: LOVE that
01/08/17, 21:23 - Circle: Fuck em haha
01/08/17, 21:25 - Circle: Anyway it was great talking to you . I was about to give up on humans but you've managed to cheer me up so thankyou.  I better get to bed now its 1:25 am here !
01/08/17, 21:30 - Tahnacious: Oh, OK all the best and sweet dreams. I am happy to be a reason to vote for faith in humanity 🤣
01/08/17, 21:50 - Infected: Evening.
01/08/17, 21:50 - Tahnacious: Greetings.
01/08/17, 21:51 - Infected: I'm currently opening a giant fuck off packaging. I dislike strings. The ones that are a cardboard consistency
01/08/17, 21:54 - Infected: It is my firm believe that the dregs of society develop packaging for toys.
01/08/17, 22:04 - Tahnacious: Yeah I don't like it. It is so wasteful
01/08/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: Simple basic packaging is nice, easy to open and no dividers or crazy components for no reason
01/08/17, 22:05 - Tahnacious: If it isn't going to get dirty easy I don't really see the need for packaging to begin with
01/08/17, 22:06 - Infected: Yes. The toy company that I mostly buy from uses plastic screws in the bottoms of the packaging. They also encase the toy is string and plastic. It's annoying and unnecessary.
01/08/17, 22:07 - Infected: I miss when everything came in a box and just had a picture on the front.
01/08/17, 23:18 - Janith: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23271.html?foxtrotcallback=true
01/08/17, 23:28 - Shaiju: Diabolic!😂 If it was your kitchen store, could have named diabolic kitchens (just for the hang of it). The interesting part is there was not much progress on the naming front except for the fuzz around it. Lol :) Typical over analysis followed by procrastination! 😂
01/08/17, 23:40 - Tahnacious: Well said 😉
02/08/17, 00:17 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬ entrou usando o link de convite deste grupo
02/08/17, 00:18 - Amin: Well cum
02/08/17, 00:18 - ‪+504 9990-4504‬: You know what I loathe?
02/08/17, 00:19 - Amin: Yes
02/08/17, 00:37 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: no

02/08/17, 00:44 - ‪+62 822-8456-7258‬: must be feelers
02/08/17, 00:44 - Lulu: I was trying to catch up but I gave up and scrolled down
02/08/17, 00:44 - Janith: Same. Though I didn't try either 😂
02/08/17, 00:44 - Lulu: I was "reading" it
02/08/17, 00:59 - Tahnacious: That's OK, it was mostly me anyway hah
02/08/17, 01:56 - Didier: Same 😂
02/08/17, 02:45 - Tel: Oo another English person! :)
02/08/17, 02:46 - Tahnacious: Hah yeah

02/08/17, 02:48 - Shaiju: And you did not sleep!
02/08/17, 02:49 - Shaiju: Damn...I forgot it is GMT +10
02/08/17, 02:49 - Tahnacious: Yeah I don't do that
02/08/17, 02:49 - Tahnacious: If I sleep it is usually for an hour at a time
02/08/17, 02:50 - Shaiju: 😳 sociopath?
02/08/17, 02:50 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
02/08/17, 02:50 - Tahnacious: No, just an insomniac
02/08/17, 02:50 - Tel: God.. Yea, this. Annoying.
02/08/17, 02:51 - Tel: Late! This is a lie in :)
02/08/17, 02:51 - Tahnacious: Haha, lucky you
02/08/17, 02:51 - Shaiju: 😂
02/08/17, 02:52 - Shaiju: Lie or lie?
02/08/17, 02:52 - Tel: What time is it in Oz @61477394075?
02/08/17, 02:52 - Tel: Lie as in lay
02/08/17, 02:53 - Shaiju: The meaning was obvious. I was searching for confusion and chaos.. :)
02/08/17, 02:54 - Tahnacious: Almost 4pm
02/08/17, 02:55 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
02/08/17, 02:57 - Tel: Defo. That's what I've found.. Think that's why young life is harder too - you don't get to pick your friends as much, social circle small, and statistically hardly any Ns around
02/08/17, 02:57 - Tel: Haha ok :p
02/08/17, 02:57 - Tel: Lol what on earth..?
02/08/17, 02:58 - Tel: Ooo! Something I've been meaning to play but haven't found a decent group to do it with yet.. Do you play?
02/08/17, 02:58 - Tahnacious: I thought someone may find it amusing
02/08/17, 02:59 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah, they're easy to find here :)
02/08/17, 02:59 - Tahnacious: I'm not against doing an online Skype group either
02/08/17, 02:59 - Tahnacious: This
02/08/17, 03:02 - Tel: Defo did!
02/08/17, 03:04 - Tel: Oo way cool. Do you know others that would? I reckon that'd be pretty cool. 

#ifINTPsdidD&D... _It would be online and hella crazy_
02/08/17, 03:04 - Infected: I sleep around 4 hours at a time. I just woke up, it's 1 a.m.
02/08/17, 03:04 - Tel: I just bought over £100 worth of board games this past weekend.. Fun fun.. 😁
02/08/17, 03:05 - Infected: I grew up very sheltered. I had 0 friends. Libraries ftw
02/08/17, 03:05 - Tel: That's how ppl used to sleep - v traditional. Esp including the talking to neighbours but in the middle!
02/08/17, 03:06 - Infected: No talking to neighbors for me lol
02/08/17, 03:06 - Tel: Guessing this is an INTP thing too? Or perhaps an NT thing.. I'm guessing NFs have less of an issue..
02/08/17, 03:06 - Tel: Well, I'm including us in that :p
02/08/17, 03:07 - Infected: The no friends thing didn't particularly bother me. We lived in the country so I spent most of my time in nature.
02/08/17, 03:07 - Infected: You guys are alright : )
02/08/17, 03:08 - Tahnacious: We could probably find enough people to start a group here
02/08/17, 03:08 - Tahnacious: My life in a nutshell
02/08/17, 03:08 - Tahnacious: This
02/08/17, 03:11 - Tel: Anyone play chess here btw?
02/08/17, 03:11 - Infected: I've always wanted to play d&d, actually.
02/08/17, 03:11 - Infected: When I was a kid.
02/08/17, 03:11 - Tel: 🤘🏻
02/08/17, 03:12 - Tel: Hm, well enough to know opening theory or just understood the way pieces moved?
02/08/17, 03:12 - Infected: The second bit.
02/08/17, 03:12 - Tel: K :)
02/08/17, 03:13 - Tel: There's lots to it.. Way more than I understood as a kid. Playing atm online, hence wondered re in this group
02/08/17, 03:15 - Infected: I might give it a try. I never liked games. I played because we had a family game night. Participation was mandatory. I like solitary activities. Playing online is alright, though.
02/08/17, 03:16 - Tel: I'm on the chess.com app - lawtel = username - if ya fancy a game
02/08/17, 03:17 - Infected: I'll make a note of it. One of the other chat members got me into tetris friends. I like it.

02/08/17, 04:01 - Tel: I got unavailable for you too.
02/08/17, 04:02 - Tel: I just clicked anyway.. It's searching for you.
02/08/17, 04:02 - Tel: Go to the area where you play bullet games. Perhaps you need to do that first
02/08/17, 04:03 - Tel: Lol someone else started on our game.. Annoying. Resigned and lost 54 points. Oops
02/08/17, 04:03 - Tel: Try start a game vs me now?

02/08/17, 04:21 - Tel: Play again later? Good games. 2nd a bit more level.. I got lucky positionally towards the end, but you owned me at the beginning
02/08/17, 04:21 - Tel: Think you know your openings better than me?
02/08/17, 04:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sure. Good games
02/08/17, 04:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well I haven't particularly studied any openings
02/08/17, 04:22 - Tel: Fair enough, good effort then
02/08/17, 04:22 - Tel: Osmotic learning :p
02/08/17, 04:22 - Tel: Else freaking clever timing on the spot! Haha
02/08/17, 04:22 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Haha exactly. Experience is a good teacher
02/08/17, 04:22 - Tel: Thinking*
02/08/17, 04:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I picked up the London system from a few games
02/08/17, 04:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: And developed it to suit my playing style
02/08/17, 04:23 - Tel: Which is the London - the one you played in 2nd?
02/08/17, 04:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I probably played it in both
02/08/17, 04:23 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Maybe some transposition
02/08/17, 04:24 - Tel: Hm interesting
02/08/17, 04:24 - Tel: I'm having a look at both games atm so will have a look see :)
02/08/17, 04:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Sure 😄
02/08/17, 04:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You broke my winning streak lmao 😆
02/08/17, 04:26 - Tel: Lol sorry
02/08/17, 04:26 - Tel: How many games I'm a row?
02/08/17, 04:26 - Tel: In*
02/08/17, 04:35 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I don't remember and the app won't open up now
02/08/17, 04:36 - Tel: Fair enough :)
02/08/17, 04:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Before you some 1500s guy screwed me
02/08/17, 04:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I should stop playing lol I tend to overplay and lose focus
02/08/17, 04:36 - Tel: You don't seem to play much other than bullet? Stalking your chess profile.. Haha
02/08/17, 04:36 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've been playing for like 3 hours now
02/08/17, 04:36 - Tel: Yea, I do that too
02/08/17, 04:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah I only play 3 min blitz
02/08/17, 04:37 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Not bullet
02/08/17, 04:38 - Tel: Ah yea, sorry.. That's how little I play it, I don't even know the terminology! Haha. Daily chess is my thing
02/08/17, 04:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I saw that 😬
02/08/17, 04:38 - Tel: 3 hours? Wowzer. When did you start payinge chess? As in not today, but years or?
02/08/17, 04:38 - Tel: 🙈
02/08/17, 04:38 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It's been around one and a half year, if you're talking really playing chess
02/08/17, 04:39 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Wbu
02/08/17, 04:40 - Tel: On and off for maybe 7/8 years. Large spell of off, then intense on.. Less intense these days. I only play about 6 daily games at once, rather than 50/60...
02/08/17, 04:41 - Tel: I have a lot less free time since I got a decent job, and when I went off I'd just stop playing, which meant 50/6 losses in a row. Lol
02/08/17, 04:41 - Tel: 60*
02/08/17, 04:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whoa
02/08/17, 04:41 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: You're quite experienced then
02/08/17, 04:42 - Tel: Well, it seems that you've played almost as many blitz games as I have daily
02/08/17, 04:42 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Is it?
02/08/17, 04:42 - Tel: 9k blitz and I think I've played 12k daily, from memory
02/08/17, 04:43 - Tel: Think I'm right with those..
02/08/17, 04:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Whoa
02/08/17, 04:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: But I guess I play a hell lot
02/08/17, 04:43 - Tel: Haha Yup
02/08/17, 04:43 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: In the middle of morning, in the middle of noon, in the middle of eve, and in the middle of the night
02/08/17, 04:43 - Tel: Esp in a short period of time!
02/08/17, 04:44 - Tel: Hahaha yea
02/08/17, 04:45 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Well it gave me a headache. I'll need to buzz. Laters
02/08/17, 04:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Just text me whenever you want to play. Any time. There's a 90% probability that I'll be up
02/08/17, 04:47 - Tel: Lol ok. Catch ya later
02/08/17, 04:56 - Tahnacious: Used to a lot as a kid, either with my computer or my dad
02/08/17, 05:35 - Tel: Fancy a game sometime @61477394075? Jash would like it as well I'm sure
02/08/17, 05:36 - Tel: Can start up a chess club as well as D&D.. :p
02/08/17, 05:36 - Tel: How social we INTPs are when it involves cogitation.
02/08/17, 05:39 - Shaiju: ☺
02/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'll be up for it when I'm having a day at home hah. Haven't played in over 10 years though so don't mind me if I'm bad haha
02/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: Sounds good
02/08/17, 06:44 - Tel: Cool :)
02/08/17, 06:44 - Tel: Have you got / can you get the chess.com app?
02/08/17, 06:45 - Tahnacious: I'll get it when I get home
02/08/17, 06:46 - Tahnacious: Just remind at some point haha
02/08/17, 06:49 - Circle: I seriously cant believe how little you sleep ! The thought of not sleeping alone is making me tired 😥
02/08/17, 06:50 - Circle: Yes fellow brit ! How do you do
02/08/17, 06:50 - Didier: How little?
02/08/17, 06:53 - Circle: sorry she said she only sleeps for a couple of hours .
02/08/17, 06:53 - Circle: That was @61477394075
02/08/17, 06:55 - Tel: Haha okie dokes
02/08/17, 06:56 - Tel: I'm good ta!! How's you? Where ya from? I'm an east Londoner
02/08/17, 06:56 - Circle: Im from a town called northampton , its just past miltonkeynes
02/08/17, 06:57 - Tel: Yup I know it, both of 'em
02/08/17, 06:57 - Circle: East london eh ? Are you worried about the acid attacks at all ?
02/08/17, 06:59 - Tel: Nah.. I'm not in a car
02/08/17, 06:59 - Tel: Think they're doing it to steal cars no?
02/08/17, 06:59 - Circle: I lived in lewisham, kingston and greenwhich for a short while miss london 😞
02/08/17, 06:59 - Tel: Oo cool. Don't know those areas so well
02/08/17, 07:00 - Circle: Your from east london ? Just past whats it called blackwall tunnel ?
02/08/17, 07:00 - Circle: South east london
02/08/17, 07:00 - Circle: You don't drive ?
02/08/17, 07:01 - Tel: Well, a bit further out tbh. Hornchurch if you know it? On the borders of Essex and London. And nope! Don't drive. Used to, up til  a few months ago. Now I cycle everywhere :)
02/08/17, 07:02 - Circle: Thats brilliant i wish i could cycle everywhere
02/08/17, 07:04 - Tel: Yea.. Bit harder outside of London
02/08/17, 07:04 - Tel: Hard enough inside tbh. But at least everything is close together
02/08/17, 07:05 - Circle: Thats true but i think if i wasn't so lazy i would have done it regardless 😂
02/08/17, 07:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I've been to Essex. My uncle lives there
02/08/17, 07:10 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Definitely. It'd be fun and we all could probably improve our game as well
02/08/17, 07:13 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it is normal for me.
02/08/17, 07:15 - Tahnacious: I think it is due to depression and maybe some deep set loneliness. I sleep better with someone beside me.
02/08/17, 07:18 - Circle: Is loneliness an intp thing ?
02/08/17, 07:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Yeah
02/08/17, 07:21 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: More like an introvert thing
02/08/17, 07:21 - Tahnacious: I dunno
02/08/17, 07:22 - Tahnacious: I think some introverts cope better with us
02/08/17, 07:22 - Circle: Hmmm
02/08/17, 07:22 - Tahnacious: Our Fe makes us feel a deep seated need to belong
02/08/17, 07:22 - Tahnacious: Some in greater quantities than others
02/08/17, 07:22 - Circle: Yeah
02/08/17, 07:22 - Circle: I second that
02/08/17, 07:23 - Circle: Yet we also enjoy being the unique ones ?
02/08/17, 07:23 - Tahnacious: Yeah
02/08/17, 07:24 - Tahnacious: We are almost martyrs haha
02/08/17, 07:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: How does Fe make us feel the need to belong?
02/08/17, 07:24 - Tahnacious: It is very other people orientated
02/08/17, 07:24 - Tahnacious: Some intps just don't use their Fe much
02/08/17, 07:24 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: It is but it's feeling oriented
02/08/17, 07:25 - Tahnacious: I think my Fe is actually at the point where it is stronger than my Si
02/08/17, 07:25 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Isn't it like sensing what's going on inside the head of the other person?
02/08/17, 07:25 - Tahnacious: 9/10 times when I use Si it is due to unhealthy looping
02/08/17, 07:26 - Tahnacious: Sensing is memory related in Si
02/08/17, 07:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I gotta go, my show started
02/08/17, 07:26 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Laters
02/08/17, 07:27 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: If anyone's thinking about watching Valerian, go for it. Nice vfx
02/08/17, 07:28 - Tahnacious: And Fe is more about pleasing people and interacting socially
02/08/17, 07:28 - Tahnacious: It is scary... Lol
02/08/17, 07:29 - Janith: Same here. Fe is generally the best for social interactions
02/08/17, 07:29 - Tahnacious: I mean I can get by with Ne but Fe is what makes me appear approachable
02/08/17, 07:30 - Janith: But Ne is where all the fun is at!
02/08/17, 07:39 - Circle: Fe is what causes people to love me initially but then the true ne comes out ! I feel a bit like sheldon at times
02/08/17, 07:40 - Tahnacious: Usually I'm the other way around
02/08/17, 07:40 - Tahnacious: People see me as a weirdo at first
02/08/17, 07:41 - Tahnacious: But then after a while they find my Fe and know that in fact I'm a toasted marshmallow.
02/08/17, 07:42 - Circle: Aww . Perhaps fe is dominant or even core in you ?
02/08/17, 07:42 - Janith: No its still inferior. But probably we'll developed
02/08/17, 07:42 - Circle: Dont get me wrong i know how to carry on acting fe but i feel fake and sooner or later i have to drop it
02/08/17, 07:43 - Janith: I mainly try to keep my Fe on a leash
02/08/17, 07:43 - Janith: It's annoying letting it loose
02/08/17, 07:43 - Circle: I see ,
02/08/17, 07:44 - Circle: Do you think it's possible to change your personality type ?
02/08/17, 07:44 - Janith: Yes. Odds are a person's personality type will change multiple times throughout their lives
02/08/17, 07:45 - Circle: I want to become an isfj or esfj ...
02/08/17, 07:45 - Janith: Though there will be one configuration they'd be most likely to be in
02/08/17, 07:45 - Janith: Whyyy???
02/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: Inferior functions are an awkward thing. Manifests differently in different people of the same type
02/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: You can't change your personality type but you can develop your subconscious functions
02/08/17, 07:47 - Tahnacious: To the point where you begin to emulate another type, but you'll never feel whole or right
02/08/17, 07:48 - Circle: 😞
02/08/17, 07:48 - Tahnacious: I drift between letting it free and reeling it in
02/08/17, 07:49 - Janith: Seriously though why would you want to be a sensor?
02/08/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: Esfj is easier to emulate because they share our functions in reverse order
02/08/17, 07:49 - Circle: Im having a midlife crisis LOL my life would be so much easier if i was part of the most comman personalities
02/08/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: An intj observed that I reminded him a lot of his wife
02/08/17, 07:49 - Tahnacious: Turns out she was esfj
02/08/17, 07:50 - Janith: And I disagree. You can but it will no longer be "you"
02/08/17, 07:50 - Janith: Usually you need a a strong stimulus
02/08/17, 07:50 - Circle: Oddly in one of the personality test ive done it said i was an intj
02/08/17, 07:50 - Janith: Maybe easier but way less interesting
02/08/17, 07:51 - Tahnacious: In my opinion ones personality is their core as a person, not what they show or present themselves as. That would just be insecurity of their own type.
02/08/17, 07:51 - Janith: Same. I generally put my money on cognitive function tests and not just the usual tests
02/08/17, 07:51 - Tahnacious: I get intj in socionics which is INTP in their version
02/08/17, 07:51 - Janith: The core can change too
02/08/17, 07:51 - Circle: I dont want to emulate them , that i think all of us can do with any personality type . I actually want to be them !
02/08/17, 07:52 - Tahnacious: I can't really see how
02/08/17, 07:52 - Janith: Long periods of depression, trauma
02/08/17, 07:52 - Janith: That kinda stuff
02/08/17, 07:52 - Tahnacious: I've had that and I haven't changed
02/08/17, 07:52 - Janith: It doesn't work for everyone
02/08/17, 07:53 - Janith: If you're deeply entrenched in your identity then you're likely to remain stable
02/08/17, 07:53 - Circle: You mean trauma induced fractured personality types
02/08/17, 07:53 - Janith: Basically Yeah
02/08/17, 07:53 - Tahnacious: Head trauma... Possibly
02/08/17, 07:53 - Circle: Or do you mean people just learning yo fake a personslity type?
02/08/17, 07:53 - Janith: Obviously not the healthiest option 😆
02/08/17, 07:53 - Tahnacious: Lol
02/08/17, 07:54 - Circle: Hahaha
02/08/17, 07:54 - Janith: Just saying it's not impossible if you're desperate enough 😂
02/08/17, 07:54 - Janith: Personally though I advise you stay intp
02/08/17, 07:55 - Circle: I like to weigh out the benifet of most things i do . And currently i dont see a clear benifet of being intp
02/08/17, 07:55 - Tahnacious: I'd advise those who aren't INTP to convert. We have cookies
02/08/17, 07:56 - Circle: Infact i find my self loathing the general population
02/08/17, 07:56 - Circle: Cookies 😃
02/08/17, 07:56 - Tahnacious: Yeah, ooops. That's a thing.
02/08/17, 07:58 - Circle: But if i were the general population id be able to find some happiness haha
02/08/17, 07:59 - Circle: Sadly im so weird i dont even enjoy any type of music ...
02/08/17, 07:59 - Tahnacious: That's unusual I guess
02/08/17, 08:00 - Tahnacious: I bet there's stuff that most people like yet I don't
02/08/17, 08:00 - Circle: Its very unusual ive never met anyone who thinks that way , i just never got it
02/08/17, 08:00 - Tahnacious: I just see music as another thing to deconstruct and stufy
02/08/17, 08:01 - Tahnacious: *study
02/08/17, 08:01 - Tahnacious: I dislike sports but I don't think that counts
02/08/17, 08:01 - Circle: What was your findings ?
02/08/17, 08:01 - Circle: I too dislike sports
02/08/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: Mostly that chord progression is key to creating atmosphere within music and once one song ends the next song played should match the chord progression otherwise the entire mood turns jaded.
02/08/17, 08:02 - Circle: Ive tried bits of every genre and didn't feel a thing im kind og jealous of people who find enjoyment in music
02/08/17, 08:02 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah, and guitar hurts my hands. I learned that too :)
02/08/17, 08:03 - Circle: Hahahs
02/08/17, 08:03 - Tahnacious: For me it is an Si thing I think
02/08/17, 08:03 - Tahnacious: Certain songs or chords linked to memories
02/08/17, 08:03 - Circle: But your findings sound subjective to me but that might be because music doesnt do any thing for me
02/08/17, 08:04 - Tahnacious: That's OK, I can appreciate alternate point of view, I just find it interesting
02/08/17, 08:04 - Tahnacious: It is basically just more math if you get to the roots.
02/08/17, 08:05 - Circle: Wow im surprised i haven't managed to offend anyone.....yet
02/08/17, 08:05 - Tahnacious: Hahaha, me too
02/08/17, 08:05 - Tahnacious: I'm pretty sure all the souls here are easy going in that regard
02/08/17, 08:06 - Circle: Im home 😍
02/08/17, 08:06 - Tahnacious: Haha
02/08/17, 08:06 - Tahnacious: I'm trying to think of something that would offend me
02/08/17, 08:07 - Circle: It offends me when people dont accept fact
02/08/17, 08:07 - Tahnacious: Teenage mum waiting in centerlink (government funding for people who don't want to work) with 3+ children, all of them screaming. I think that's pretty offensive.
02/08/17, 08:07 - Circle: Hahahahshahsh
02/08/17, 08:08 - Circle: Thats so true
02/08/17, 08:08 - Tahnacious: I am OK with people not accepting fact. I merely just impart knowledge. Up to the individual what they do with it.
02/08/17, 08:08 - Tahnacious: I take a "suit yourself, lemme  try and hold back the I-told-you-so's" stance
02/08/17, 08:09 - Circle: It annoys me and i end up breaking why they are not accepting the truth to them and thats when i know they hate me ! Sometimes wish i could keep my mouth shut in that regard . But i appreciate when someone explains my wrong doings
02/08/17, 08:09 - Tahnacious: I guess it may bother me if this other persons decisions and denial of fact have a great effect on myself
02/08/17, 08:10 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I almost like being told I'm wrong
02/08/17, 08:10 - Tahnacious: It is an opportunity to learn, on both sides.
02/08/17, 08:10 - Circle: Same but people dont like doing that with me because of my rebuttals
02/08/17, 08:11 - Circle: Exactly
02/08/17, 08:11 - Tahnacious: I'm almost amazed at how healthily my functions appear to work yet my state of mind is anything but... Hahaha
02/08/17, 08:11 - Circle: Haha
02/08/17, 08:12 - Tahnacious: Sometimes I debate, but I tryyyyy to end it. I really do appreciate having the last word though, especially in the face of stupidity
02/08/17, 08:13 - Circle: Do you ever find after a debate that person will carry on disagreeing with you but months later the same person will repeat your point to others ? Or sometimes they will repeat it back to me but they think it was themselves who came up with it
02/08/17, 08:24 - Tahnacious: Omg yes ahahhaha
02/08/17, 08:24 - Tahnacious: This actually happens
02/08/17, 08:24 - Tahnacious: Reminds me of Timon from the lion king
02/08/17, 08:24 - Tahnacious: But yeah I conjure that image every time it happens to me
02/08/17, 08:27 - Circle: So annoying but ive learned to let it slide for the greater good LOL
02/08/17, 08:27 - Tahnacious: Yeah hah, at least somewhere they know I'm right
02/08/17, 08:30 - Circle: Thats the thing i dont think they know haha
02/08/17, 08:30 - Circle: But its good for me though because i like having confirmation that i was right LOL
02/08/17, 10:02 - Amin: What up
02/08/17, 10:04 - Circle: Hello 😊
02/08/17, 10:50 - Tel: Hm, is loneliness an INTP thing, or do ppl here find it decreases as you become more self aware?
02/08/17, 10:51 - Tel: I found the latter, though definitely experienced the former. 

Tbh, I still experience the former, but to much less of a degree. More expressed as sadness that other unaware contrary types love to judge us..
02/08/17, 10:52 - Tel: Yea. It's annoying. Can't stop that :/
02/08/17, 10:52 - Tel: We're both Abraham and the lamb..
02/08/17, 10:52 - Tel: Oo good stuff. I so want to see it. You recommend?
02/08/17, 10:54 - Tel: Emulate or 'be'? You can't switch your base personality.. You are you. No type is better or worse.. They're just different.
02/08/17, 10:56 - Tel: Lol. Totally
02/08/17, 10:56 - Shaiju: 😔
02/08/17, 10:59 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: I do
02/08/17, 11:00 - Tel: As good as fifth element was?
02/08/17, 11:01 - Tel: Loved that film when I was younger
02/08/17, 11:01 - Tel: You ok @918123428275?
02/08/17, 11:02 - Shaiju: Haha...I was just musing... Feeling melancholic.. (rare usage of Feeling). Thanks for asking though :)
02/08/17, 11:03 - Tel: ☺
02/08/17, 11:08 - Circle: My experience has been quite the opposite the more self aware i became the lonier i felt unfortunately, and yes i meant to "be" not to emulate
02/08/17, 11:09 - Tel: Hm interesting. Maybe I've developed my Fe such means it affects me less, but that the loneliness is more profound.. Hm, no I don't think so in which reflection
02/08/17, 11:09 - Tel: On quick*
02/08/17, 11:09 - Tel: I think my loneliness is decreased as I hang around a *lot* of Ns
02/08/17, 11:10 - Circle: Also i hope you didnt think i was saying any type was better or worse what i meant to say was i believe I would benifet more in general by not being intp
02/08/17, 11:10 - Tel: INFJs, an INTP, and Couple of ENTJs / ENFP / ENFJ
02/08/17, 11:10 - Tel: No no, I was just trying to be clear on it rather than presuming what you said
02/08/17, 11:10 - Shaiju: I prefer to call it the 'existential struggle' to fit in :)
02/08/17, 11:11 - Tel: Oh, and this lot! (*looks at group*)
02/08/17, 11:11 - Tel: Benefit how?
02/08/17, 11:13 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: Don't count on anything except gorgeous vfx
02/08/17, 11:13 - Shaiju: Yeah.. it helps but the downside is that a constricted world view. 'Cyber balkanization' is the right term I guess (w.r.to this group).
02/08/17, 11:13 - Shaiju: * that ensues..
02/08/17, 11:13 - Circle: I think what im trying to say is i wish i was like the general population to fit in with them LOL to be able to find enjoyment in the simpler thing to not have a need to analyze every action or thought . Basically to be normal
02/08/17, 11:14 - Shaiju: Normal is an illusion ..what is normal to spider is chaos to flies.. ( filtched quote)
02/08/17, 11:16 - Circle: Yes but being a fly in the world of spiders is bringing chaos to my life so i want to change my genetics and become a spider to avoid the chaos
02/08/17, 11:17 - Shaiju: Lol 😂
02/08/17, 11:18 - Circle: i feel like all the Ns in real life are hiding from me
02/08/17, 11:26 - Amin: Hey
02/08/17, 11:26 - Amin: We are always alone
02/08/17, 11:27 - Amin: It goes like this
02/08/17, 11:27 - Amin: Im bored
02/08/17, 11:32 - Circle: Why are you bored?
02/08/17, 11:33 - Circle: Our conversation is boring you or in general?
02/08/17, 11:33 - Amin: No
02/08/17, 11:33 - Amin: I need drink to get out of boredom
02/08/17, 11:33 - Amin: But I cant
02/08/17, 11:34 - Circle: I didn't realise alcohol is openly available in iran
02/08/17, 11:34 - Amin: It is
02/08/17, 11:34 - Amin: 😂
02/08/17, 11:34 - Amin: Its not legal
02/08/17, 11:34 - Circle: Ah i c
02/08/17, 11:34 - Amin: But rules arent that strict here
02/08/17, 11:37 - Circle: Which brings me to another question , how comman is it for INTP to  substance abuse legal or ilegal
02/08/17, 11:39 - Amin: I dont know
02/08/17, 11:39 - Circle: Do you drink often ?
02/08/17, 11:39 - Amin: No 😂
02/08/17, 11:40 - Amin: I work often
02/08/17, 11:40 - Circle: You mentioned you need a drink to ease boredom...

02/08/17, 11:42 - Amin: Long story
02/08/17, 11:42 - Amin: Choose to live more alone
02/08/17, 11:42 - Amin: I cant handle friendship
02/08/17, 11:43 - Circle: The fact that you mentioned you lost your freinds must mean you want to talk about it
02/08/17, 11:43 - Circle: So ive got time

02/08/17, 12:05 - Janith: Unless of course they were expecting nice INTPs
02/08/17, 12:05 - Tel: Yes/no. Top many S's to ignore their world view! Kinda forced on you
02/08/17, 12:05 - Amin: Do they exist? 😂😂

02/08/17, 12:06 - Amin: Focus on the intelligence thing I told u
02/08/17, 12:06 - Janith: I didn't take it personally. I was wondering what the logical basis of your argument was
02/08/17, 12:06 - Amin: I may have missed them
02/08/17, 12:07 - Janith: Most of the reasons I could think of for an INTP being dissatisfied aren't here in this group
02/08/17, 12:07 - Amin: See @447544834100  janith is nicer than me, he explains stuff to u
02/08/17, 12:07 - Janith: Unless you are thoroughly against sexual harassment I'm which case.... I'm working on it
02/08/17, 12:07 - Circle: Yes its true janith thanks gor your explanation i am forever indebted
02/08/17, 12:08 - Amin: Its cool, at least u are realistic
02/08/17, 12:08 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/08/17, 12:08 - Janith: 😅
That raises a question
02/08/17, 12:08 - Janith: How do you guys handle gratitude?
02/08/17, 12:08 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
02/08/17, 12:09 - Janith: Gratitude returns an unhandled exception in my brain 😂
02/08/17, 12:09 - Amin: With sex
02/08/17, 12:09 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Dude being an INTP is the greatest thing. We're often articulate, well researched, have really really great taste in music, are independent, but still inclusive and nonjudgmental of others. Our impatience of others is often due to perceived lack of competency and authenticity. We're so different and it's so good.
02/08/17, 12:10 - Amin: DID is your solution
02/08/17, 12:10 - Janith: What don't you solve with sex?
02/08/17, 12:10 - Janith: 👆
02/08/17, 12:10 - Amin: Do the grateful with ur handle
02/08/17, 12:11 - Amin: Hmmm, math
02/08/17, 12:11 - Janith: The fact is... We're awesome. 😎
02/08/17, 12:11 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/08/17, 12:11 - Circle: 🙂
02/08/17, 12:11 - Amin: Then I have an awesome part too
02/08/17, 12:11 - Amin: Though I dont find single personality fun
02/08/17, 12:12 - Janith: May I ask, what's going on in your life that you feel like a change in personality might help?
02/08/17, 12:12 - Amin: Sex
02/08/17, 12:12 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: This makes perfect sense.
02/08/17, 12:12 - Circle: LOL NO
02/08/17, 12:13 - Amin: The real q is, what makes perfect sex?
02/08/17, 12:14 - Janith: Ah okay. Well then I'm out of advice 🤗
02/08/17, 12:14 - Amin: 😂😂😂
02/08/17, 12:14 - Circle: Haha thanks for trying
02/08/17, 12:14 - Amin: Thanks to u
02/08/17, 12:14 - Janith: No problem. I had free time
02/08/17, 12:15 - Circle: Free time well used
02/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: Free time or u?
02/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: Some may ask
02/08/17, 12:17 - Circle: Please elaborate ?
02/08/17, 12:32 - Shaiju: But there is more to it. It's interesting to note that the complexity within one note (of a song) and it's transition to the next creates an intriguing effect.  e.g.A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics (James Horner)
02/08/17, 12:33 - Shaiju: May be its just me...🙄
02/08/17, 12:33 - Amin: 😂 Im just messing with u

02/08/17, 17:05 - Infected: There's nothing interesting about being normal. Contrived happiness isn't authentic. It's dull and predictable.
02/08/17, 17:15 - Circle: Hmm
02/08/17, 17:17 - Infected: Even "normal" happy people have things they would rather be and situations they wish would change etc.
02/08/17, 17:20 - Circle: I get what your saying i just think in some cases its more beneficial to blend with the world . Dont get me wrong i think unique people are needed to improve the world to create invent and inspire . But personally there is no benefit to me thinking the way i do
02/08/17, 17:26 - Infected: Perhaps. How is it exactly that you think?
02/08/17, 17:34 - Circle: I have this innate need to resolve every problem i encounter . I need to constantly break everything down , i have trouble maintaining friendships because of sceptical side , people always end up disliking me because they think im either patronizing them or i cant stand being wrong which is untrue thats not my intention i just treat people how i want to be treated . I almost enjoy being told im why im wrong .. also my love affair with Google causes me much dispair hah
02/08/17, 17:35 - Circle: Not the most eloquent way of putting it lol^^
02/08/17, 17:38 - Circle: I dont consider myself a very interesting person so i have no qualms with being dull and predictable in fact i might even like order in my chaotic mind
02/08/17, 17:49 - Infected: It sounds like your mind already has order to me.
02/08/17, 17:51 - Circle: Ok lets ignore why for now , do you think its possible to change your personality type ?

02/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: I don't think it's impossible. You have a base program but how you build and develop it is up to you.
02/08/17, 17:55 - Circle: Ahahhh
02/08/17, 18:03 - Infected: What personality is it that you want?
02/08/17, 18:03 - Circle: Isfj esfj
02/08/17, 18:05 - Infected: Then learn how to foster those functions and develop them.
02/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: No
02/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: 😁
02/08/17, 18:06 - Arne: Indeed, it's how you deal/handle with it
02/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: Yes
02/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: According to the theory and research, you have a base personality. You can, however, develop your weaknesses / build on your strengths
02/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: It is naturally easier to build on your strengths as they come easier to you
02/08/17, 18:08 - Tel: INTPs love introverted thinking, therefore do not mind doing lots of it to develop it. It's relatively easy
02/08/17, 18:09 - Circle: Interesting!
02/08/17, 18:09 - Tel: However, the INTPs weakest area is extroverted feeling (in primary stack). It takes more effort to develop, tires the INTP out easier (instead of giving energy like the Ti), which means you're going against the flow
02/08/17, 18:10 - Tel: ISFJ / ESFJ at least has the same primary stack
02/08/17, 18:10 - Circle: So its possible 😁
02/08/17, 18:10 - Tel: But different order and they work differently for that reason
02/08/17, 18:11 - Tel: Hm, let's give an example
02/08/17, 18:11 - Tel: I build on my Fe and make values based decisions at work for my staff. I do this, however, because it's logical to do so.
02/08/17, 18:11 - Tel: My Fe is supporting my Ti
02/08/17, 18:12 - Circle: I spoke to a girl the other day who said she can spend hours thinkin of nothing staring at a wall. I could not believe it , how can someone be thinking of nothing ?
02/08/17, 18:12 - Tel: To be an ISFJ, I would actually feel their emotions and then perhaps use my Ti to logically work to fix it
02/08/17, 18:12 - Circle: That makes alot of sense
02/08/17, 18:13 - Circle: I virtually met an empath once i was quite shocked by his skills !
02/08/17, 18:13 - Tel: Perhaps this is cognitive semantics.. Idano. I'd suggest that it plays out to big differences though.
02/08/17, 18:14 - Tel: Empath?
02/08/17, 18:14 - Tel: As in the sci fi type?
02/08/17, 18:16 - Tel: Btw - everything that I've said is almost immaterial. The more important part is - why on earth would you want to? I get the rationale for developing your weaknesses and building on your strengths.. Even emulating others is a good idea. But you are who you are. Every type has good and bad..
02/08/17, 18:18 - Infected: Most people have an identity crisis at some point in their lives.
02/08/17, 18:20 - Circle: Haha  im having a midlife crisis ! Finding it very difficult to like people
02/08/17, 18:20 - Tel: Yea I get that.. Ppl suck.
02/08/17, 18:21 - Tel: I don't think Ns in general have it easy, but INTPs very it particularly rough I think (maybe slightly biased..)
02/08/17, 18:21 - Tel: Get it *
02/08/17, 18:22 - Circle: Im not looking for sympathy though im just trying to resolve it and come to a conclusion
02/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: Aren't sympathising. Being factual. They really do suck
02/08/17, 18:22 - Infected: Most people aren't very likeable. I wouldn't worry about it.

02/08/17, 18:25 - Circle: That is very kind of you , ive always been very proud of being an intp but lately i feel lile how much easier it would be to be able to get along with everyone without faking it lol
02/08/17, 18:25 - Infected: I find the attempt to change ones personality an interesting experiment but I wouldn't be Someone to attempt it, myself.
02/08/17, 18:25 - Circle: LOL
02/08/17, 18:26 - Arne: Jup
02/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: I don't think INTP's are inherently better than other types. We're less likely to get on each other's nerves, that's about it.
02/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: Yea, hard re faking. I gave up on that. I'm now just me and I explain how I am to others.. It works *fantastically* well with everyone..
02/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: ... Except my ISTJ manager
02/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: We're better and worse. Same as any other in that way
02/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: We're more functional in a group because we have more of a hive mind than other types.
02/08/17, 18:28 - Infected: Not necessarily successful, but functional, yes.
02/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: It would be fascinating if there were mbti groups for all types
02/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Each type with their own, that we could peer into.. It'd be like looking into a collective consciousness
02/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Fascinating to study and understand
02/08/17, 18:31 - Infected: I agree.
02/08/17, 18:31 - Arne: Yeah
02/08/17, 18:31 - Arne: That sounds cool
02/08/17, 18:31 - Infected: In my opinion, it's more fascinating to study people that think differently than I do.
02/08/17, 18:31 - Circle: Oh wow that would br so amazing i would love to see each groups talk
02/08/17, 18:32 - Tel: Absolutely.
02/08/17, 18:32 - Circle: Yes definatley more fascinating
02/08/17, 18:32 - Arne: Damn cool
02/08/17, 18:34 - Infected: It wouldn't be that difficult to set up a study like that.
02/08/17, 18:36 - Circle: Wouldnt people react differently because they know they will be studied later ?
02/08/17, 18:37 - Infected: That's why you don't tell them.
02/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Indeed
02/08/17, 18:38 - Circle: Wouldnt that be ilegal lol
02/08/17, 18:38 - Circle: Still would love to see the results
02/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Hm, not for personal study. If you're doing it to publish, then you'd have to tell them in order to be a le to publish..
02/08/17, 18:38 - Tel: Able
02/08/17, 18:39 - Circle: 🤗
02/08/17, 18:39 - Tel: If you're just setting it up as your own personal experiment, then it doesn't really matter
02/08/17, 18:39 - Circle: Brilliant
02/08/17, 18:40 - Tel: The main thing would be figuring out how to get ppl in. Certain types will be easier than others.. ESFJs will be damn hard - they're prob all out bungee jumping and don't care about theoretical nonsense
02/08/17, 18:40 - Tel: Who started this group up? And how?
02/08/17, 18:41 - Tel: There are a few admins.. Maybe they'll know
02/08/17, 18:41 - Infected: No idea. I don't even remember which Facebook group I found the link in to this group.
02/08/17, 18:43 - Circle: Werent we more partial to the idea of finding more people like us because we are fairly rare ? So it mighy be possible they have no reason or need to join a group with the same personality type ?
02/08/17, 18:44 - Infected: That's a possibility.
02/08/17, 18:44 - Tel: That's likely a part of it
02/08/17, 18:46 - Tel: Also - ppl with preference for introversion tend to learn deeply about topics; 
Preference for intuition like concepts / theories... 
Thinking = logic, rational decision making, trying to understand interesting topics;
Perceiving = forever taking on more and more info and not 'concluding' the research.
02/08/17, 18:46 - Tel: INTPs are kinda made for obsessing over something like mbti.
02/08/17, 18:47 - Circle: Thats very tru ^^
02/08/17, 18:47 - Tel: Even an ENTP wouldn't necessarily love it as deeply as I would. Perhaps they'd cover it, but also have covered 20 other theories just as deeply
02/08/17, 18:48 - Tel: Should have taken the generalisation out of  that one
02/08/17, 18:49 - Circle: I would think all intps would love to dwelve into this
02/08/17, 18:49 - Infected: I've never obsessed over mbti. I lightly researched it after taking the 16personalities test. What I did was join several intp groups on Facebook and I observed the people interacting in the groups.
02/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: Well, not saying everyone obsesses, but I think that INTPs are probably more prone to doing so than other types
02/08/17, 18:50 - Infected: Probably.
02/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: Ps your version of 'lightly researched' vs an ESFJ.. I wonder what that would show?
02/08/17, 18:51 - Circle: Haha
02/08/17, 18:51 - Infected: Noted lol
02/08/17, 18:51 - Tel: An ENTJ used that argument on me. I immediately backed off
02/08/17, 18:51 - Tel: Lol
02/08/17, 18:53 - Tel: I was like - I've hardly prepped for this interview.. I've only skimmed their board paper, LinkedIn checked their exec team and the interviewing panel, and prepared simple and flexible answers to the questions..
02/08/17, 18:53 - Tel: Totally efficient prep as it took a couple of hours. I'm too lazy to be inefficient
02/08/17, 18:53 - Circle: That sounds like me
02/08/17, 18:54 - Tel: Steps to prep.. Absorb info. Spout out info. Appear clever. Get job. Forget info.
02/08/17, 18:55 - Tel: The get job bit.. Guess that doesn't always work, but c'est la vie
02/08/17, 18:55 - Infected: I read up on the particular functions of the intp, glimpsed through the functions of the other types, read up on the history of mbti, researched Jung a bit, read about the soft science behind the way they differentiate between functions vs how they relate to healthy vs non healthy mind types. Read about enneagrams and sub types, etc.
02/08/17, 18:55 - Tel: LOL
02/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Like, massive lol
02/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Light research indeed. Just like Frodo had a little stroll to mount 'not so nice'
02/08/17, 18:56 - Infected: I really liked those books lol
02/08/17, 18:57 - Tel: Haha yea. Fave part of the books for me was helms deep. Loved the Legolas / Gimli relationship
02/08/17, 18:57 - Tel: Glad it translated to the film
02/08/17, 18:58 - Infected: Legolas was always my favorite.
02/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: Yea, he's pretty cool.

02/08/17, 22:56 - Infected: Yes.
02/08/17, 22:56 - Infected: Hello.
02/08/17, 22:56 - Janith: I was wondering where you were yesterday
02/08/17, 22:57 - Infected: Was I not here? I don't remember.
02/08/17, 22:57 - Janith: Well I guess that depends on "yesterday". Different time zones and stuff
02/08/17, 22:58 - Janith: Question for you, what's your position on politics?
02/08/17, 22:59 - Infected: Politics = a lot of important sounding terms for very basic human emotions.
02/08/17, 23:00 - Janith: I never really thought about it like that. You do have a point
02/08/17, 23:00 - Janith: Though I was asking cause I found myself in a unique situation yesterday 😂
02/08/17, 23:00 - Infected: Explain.
02/08/17, 23:01 - Janith: I'm playing mount and blade warband. I was hoping to eventually conquer everyone and rule the map but I have no idea how to motivate myself to do so 😂
02/08/17, 23:02 - Janith: I have almost no patience for politics
02/08/17, 23:02 - Infected: Motivation is a fickle bitch. It really isn't going to help you do anything.
02/08/17, 23:03 - Janith: True but I find myself consistently lacking her support.
02/08/17, 23:03 - Infected: If you want to accomplish something, don't motivate yourself. Routine yourself.
02/08/17, 23:03 - Janith: I lack the power seeking ambition
02/08/17, 23:04 - Infected: You don't need ambition to rule the world. You only need a better idea and a better plan than the next poor bastard.
02/08/17, 23:04 - Infected: Ambition is so basic.
02/08/17, 23:04 - Janith: That's true but you also have to play nice with people 😅
02/08/17, 23:05 - Infected: If you have to play nice, you're not really at the level where ambition makes a difference.
02/08/17, 23:05 - Janith: People are a pain
02/08/17, 23:06 - Infected: I agree but they're also simple which means they are easily manipulated.
02/08/17, 23:06 - Janith: True. I think I'll go back to training an army of war elephants in a European fantasy world 😂
02/08/17, 23:06 - Janith: Seems like the INTP thing to do
02/08/17, 23:06 - FABIO: 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
02/08/17, 23:07 - FABIO: motivation is hard to find.. :/
02/08/17, 23:07 - FABIO: its easy... if you are doing something easy.....
02/08/17, 23:07 - FABIO: everyone does... plenty of motivation.. like... trying to be a soccer player
02/08/17, 23:08 - Janith: Good point. I did give the motivation thing a try sometime back and it was as useless as you say
02/08/17, 23:10 - Janith: Now then @554691068741 @15015198024 there was a more serious topic I wanted to bring up in the group 

First, what do you think about the whole "our reality is a simulation" thing
02/08/17, 23:10 - FABIO: tottally.. is
02/08/17, 23:10 - FABIO: hahahaha
02/08/17, 23:10 - Infected: The Matrix theory?
02/08/17, 23:11 - Infected: I'm sure there's another term for it but that's how most people would recognize the idea.
02/08/17, 23:11 - Janith: I do remember seeing something yesterday that argued that if we tried to test the theory then the simulation would try to make sure we couldn't get down into the code so it would put a level of randomness into the simulation
02/08/17, 23:12 - Janith: Basically the uncertainty principle
02/08/17, 23:12 - FABIO: hmm.. interesting idea.
02/08/17, 23:12 - Janith: Pretty much
02/08/17, 23:12 - FABIO: or its just how the simulation is run
02/08/17, 23:12 - FABIO: by randomness...
02/08/17, 23:12 - Infected: This sounds similar to religion to me.
02/08/17, 23:13 - Infected: It can't be proven nor not proven.
02/08/17, 23:13 - FABIO: dont think so....
02/08/17, 23:13 - FABIO: with physics advanced enougth
02/08/17, 23:13 - Janith: That actually makes more sense. If I wanted to create a simulation I'd like to add an element of randomness into it
02/08/17, 23:13 - FABIO: i think it can be proven. or disproven.
02/08/17, 23:14 - Janith: It is actually. Which is why I don't really care for the theory. 
But the explanation for the uncertainty principle got my attention
02/08/17, 23:14 - FABIO: i found an amasing podcast about it.. i would send..but it is in protuguese
02/08/17, 23:14 - FABIO: listened 2 times.. and yet cant undestand all of what they are saying
02/08/17, 23:14 - FABIO: hahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:15 - FABIO: soo many strangness in physics
02/08/17, 23:15 - Janith: Here's the thing. If we were in a simulation then the computer we are in would make sure we don't figure it out
02/08/17, 23:15 - FABIO: electorns being in two places at once....
02/08/17, 23:15 - FABIO: the mere fact of observation.. changing its state. from wave. to particle
02/08/17, 23:15 - Janith: If we're not then... Nothing really changes. 😂
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: why the hell... in a real world... would something change
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: just becouse we are seeing it.. measuring it
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: and
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: more strange than tat
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: that
02/08/17, 23:16 - Janith: Technically though isn't that statement inaccurate?
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: no
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: they actually has a photo
02/08/17, 23:16 - FABIO: of it
02/08/17, 23:17 - Infected: This is beginning to sound like something else lol BRB
02/08/17, 23:17 - FABIO: machines dont change the outcome
02/08/17, 23:17 - Janith: That's the wave function of the electron right?
02/08/17, 23:17 - FABIO: yes
02/08/17, 23:17 - Janith: The wave can be in multiple "places" at once
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: hmmm....
02/08/17, 23:18 - Janith: But the particle state is only ever at one place
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: its the probability that is in multiple places
02/08/17, 23:18 - Janith: The eave function is just the probability of finding the particle
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: exactly
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: the wave.. is called the wave
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: becouse it is a sen cos function
02/08/17, 23:18 - FABIO: so it is... a. wave
02/08/17, 23:18 - Janith: It being high doesn't mean it can be in two places at once
02/08/17, 23:19 - FABIO: actually... does.
02/08/17, 23:19 - Janith: How?
02/08/17, 23:20 - FABIO: the outcome... doesnt resemble the source.... you have more brigth spots... than you actually shot electrons
02/08/17, 23:20 - FABIO: in that hole experiment
02/08/17, 23:20 - FABIO: you know ?
02/08/17, 23:20 - Janith: Say there's two locations where the probability is >95%
If you observe both places simultaneously then the electron only appears in one correct?
02/08/17, 23:20 - FABIO: yes
02/08/17, 23:20 - FABIO: it chooses.
02/08/17, 23:21 - FABIO: one to be
02/08/17, 23:21 - Janith: Yeah the famous double slit
02/08/17, 23:21 - FABIO: but
02/08/17, 23:21 - FABIO: there is more
02/08/17, 23:21 - FABIO: it actually chooses.. trhough TIME
02/08/17, 23:21 - FABIO: through time.
02/08/17, 23:22 - Janith: I think that there's only ever one electron as far as particles go but when it's considered as a wave it seems like it can be in many places at once
02/08/17, 23:22 - FABIO: there is.. this theory
02/08/17, 23:22 - FABIO: too
02/08/17, 23:23 - FABIO: an electron.. is actually.. an empty slot of positive particles
02/08/17, 23:23 - Janith: This actually sounds way more practical if you consider time to be just like another spacial dimension
02/08/17, 23:23 - FABIO: thats why its negative
02/08/17, 23:23 - FABIO: (its just a theory.. yet)
02/08/17, 23:23 - Janith: Except objects with a larger mass can only travel in one direction along that dimension
02/08/17, 23:23 - FABIO: it preditcs.. that you will measure.. and will choose.. before hand you actually measure it
02/08/17, 23:23 - Janith: Wait what?
02/08/17, 23:24 - FABIO: dont know if was disproven or something..... but the theory is that... an electron is actually you not having that positive particle
02/08/17, 23:24 - Janith: What are the odds that the electron isn't in the high probability location you measured?
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: not the electron.. the spin
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: this cames from the spin experiment
02/08/17, 23:25 - Janith: Err.. I'm pretty sure that was disproven 😅
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: it can choose only 2 positions... always choose the other
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: yeah.. will have to read more...
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: hahahaha
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: i dont have so many room for this theoryes anymore... i have other things to understand...
02/08/17, 23:25 - FABIO: hahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:26 - FABIO: things i believe to be way more complex.... but no close to the matrix theory
02/08/17, 23:26 - FABIO: @50494800614 is nice to be in this talk
02/08/17, 23:26 - Janith: I mean I won't deny that the quantum world is strange but I don't think it's magical. Just requires some interesting applications of logic
02/08/17, 23:26 - Infected: I was just reading about the double slit experiment.
02/08/17, 23:27 - Janith: So what are you looking into these days?
02/08/17, 23:27 - FABIO: control theoryes, circuits and machine building
02/08/17, 23:27 - Janith: Wonder where he is. Haven't heard from him in a while
02/08/17, 23:27 - FABIO: things like.. karnougth map... lyapunov theory
02/08/17, 23:27 - Infected: Magic is only science that we don't yet understand.
02/08/17, 23:27 - Janith: Awesome. Anything you'd like to add to our argument?
02/08/17, 23:27 - Janith: 😃
02/08/17, 23:28 - FABIO: karnaugh
02/08/17, 23:28 - FABIO: *
02/08/17, 23:28 - Janith: Damn... Not only do I not know what those are, I'm not even sure I can pronounce them 😂
02/08/17, 23:28 - Tahnacious: It feels nice to be appreciated but I don't really show any outward reaction
02/08/17, 23:28 - Janith: Or tricks
02/08/17, 23:29 - Infected: I think it's very interesting how simply observing an experiment can change the outcome. This leads me to wonder if it isn't the outcome but our perception and understanding of the outcome that changes.
02/08/17, 23:29 - FABIO: hahahhaa.... you think its easy to make a fucking plane..... without lyapunov.. that shit would fall....
02/08/17, 23:29 - FABIO: you wouldnt have the controll you need. to make an stable fligth
02/08/17, 23:29 - FABIO: american didnt had lyapunov.. untill the end of the cold war..... thats why russian won the space race
02/08/17, 23:30 - Janith: I personally prefer all praise being directed to my achievement and not to me. I don't process praise well 😂
02/08/17, 23:30 - FABIO: a single mathematical theory... was the difference.
02/08/17, 23:31 - Janith: That's what led to the theory that reality only exists when we're observing it
02/08/17, 23:31 - Janith: Though in general most objects with more mass than an electron tend to be fairly predictable
02/08/17, 23:31 - Infected: That makes sense. Human beings are the only creatures that care about reality and the concept of it.
02/08/17, 23:32 - Janith: That's interesting. I'll be sure to check it out
02/08/17, 23:32 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: According to that theory when we close our eyes everything else changes because we don't see amything
02/08/17, 23:32 - FABIO: you know that we dont see... the electron spin
02/08/17, 23:32 - FABIO: machines does
02/08/17, 23:32 - FABIO: it has nothing to do with US...
02/08/17, 23:32 - Infected: It's only a trick if you don't know how it works.
02/08/17, 23:32 - FABIO: it has to do with observation
02/08/17, 23:33 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I think we are the one who observe
02/08/17, 23:33 - Janith: I think it's a little hard to swallow though. Like saying the moon only exists when we're observing it effects
02/08/17, 23:34 - Infected: If a tree falls in the woods and there isn't an intp there to observe it... lol
02/08/17, 23:34 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I read about this a lot the problem is that I cannot conceptualize (?) in English as I do in Spanish xd
02/08/17, 23:34 - FABIO: untill now.... but it will probably work on other forms of inteligence too
02/08/17, 23:34 - Janith: Well the machine is just a tool. Without our observation the state might not change
02/08/17, 23:35 - Infected: We use machines to create a scenario which we can observe.
02/08/17, 23:35 - FABIO: i wonder if an IA... will change the outcome...
02/08/17, 23:35 - Janith: Yeah it doesn't change the reality that the tree fell. Which is why I don't think reality is dependent on observation
02/08/17, 23:35 - FABIO: big things. has low probability change....
02/08/17, 23:36 - Janith: 😅 IA?
02/08/17, 23:36 - Tahnacious: I would like this, let me know if you find one.
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: thats why your chair dont disapear from your fat ass
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: hahahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: AI..
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: ARTIFICAL INTELIGENCE.. sorry
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: here it is.. inteligencia artifical
02/08/17, 23:36 - FABIO: the same thing.. just backwards
02/08/17, 23:36 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: But maybe the factor "observation" can come from anybody. Like I am in my room and I close my eyes. I don't see anything but there is an observer in the next door or in jaimaica like if the observer is us all together
02/08/17, 23:36 - Infected: In a way, the tree falling would be a theory. We did not observe the tree falling nor whether it made a sound. But just because it's a theory, does that mean it isn't a reality? Obviously not.
02/08/17, 23:37 - FABIO: no.. your room is big...
02/08/17, 23:37 - FABIO: thats why
02/08/17, 23:37 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Uhm
02/08/17, 23:37 - Janith: @61477394075 out of morbid curiosity, you're not one for quantum physics are you? 😆
02/08/17, 23:37 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: It is just and example x
02/08/17, 23:37 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Xd
02/08/17, 23:37 - FABIO: the electrons in your room
02/08/17, 23:37 - FABIO: probably dont choose the spin.. when you close your eyes
02/08/17, 23:37 - FABIO: hahahahahahah
02/08/17, 23:37 - Infected: That sounds close to god theory to me.
02/08/17, 23:38 - FABIO: but the chair.... it is big.. it will always be there... closed eyes or not...
02/08/17, 23:38 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Maybe idk
02/08/17, 23:38 - FABIO: its in the math equation.. it depends the DISTANCE..
02/08/17, 23:38 - FABIO: the more distant you wanna find the electorn.. the less probability of it being there
02/08/17, 23:38 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I think that we all came from the same piece of energy xd
02/08/17, 23:38 - FABIO: your room.. is big as fuck.... so even though it changes its location..... you dont see it
02/08/17, 23:39 - Janith: I think theory and reality needs to be considered separately. Reality might always be there without the theory
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: becouse it had no big efect yo yout eyes
02/08/17, 23:39 - Janith: Theory only predicts an aspect of reality
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: to yout eyes*
02/08/17, 23:39 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Omg just imagine that when I close my eyes my room moves to Paris xd
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: your*
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: you wish han?
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: hahahaha
02/08/17, 23:39 - FABIO: it would be nice
02/08/17, 23:40 - Janith: As far as the real world is concerned nearly all the time the wave functions of all the particles will cancel each other out
02/08/17, 23:40 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Um but how do you know the size of my room. Are u watching me or something?
02/08/17, 23:40 - FABIO: 👆🏻🤣
02/08/17, 23:40 - Janith: Making sure that any large objects are severely limited in the locations they can be in
02/08/17, 23:40 - FABIO: have you taped your webcan??? if not.. i have bad news for you
02/08/17, 23:40 - FABIO: hahahahahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:40 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: It would be kinda amazing xd
02/08/17, 23:41 - FABIO: just... came after shower..
02/08/17, 23:41 - FABIO: hahahahahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:41 - Infected: I'm more into philosophy than physics, tbh. I don't have more than a passing knowledge on the subject. I do find however, that physics and philosophy often go hand in hand.
02/08/17, 23:41 - Janith: Mine is covered 😌
02/08/17, 23:42 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I used to put a paper in my laptop's webcam I still think is hacked
02/08/17, 23:42 - Infected: I have a bad paranoia complex.
02/08/17, 23:42 - FABIO: it has math.... a lot of math... if you only stick with the idea.. it is phylosophy.. it is physics when you add math to it
02/08/17, 23:42 - FABIO: always do it...
02/08/17, 23:42 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I think that everything it's linked somehow
02/08/17, 23:42 - FABIO: it is fucking easy.. to hack
02/08/17, 23:43 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Really?
02/08/17, 23:43 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: And the phone too?
02/08/17, 23:43 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Me too
02/08/17, 23:43 - FABIO: yes... me hacking you... not so easy.... but to someone is... like my neighbour
02/08/17, 23:43 - FABIO: they dont know me... but i know them
02/08/17, 23:43 - FABIO: hahahaahhahaha
02/08/17, 23:43 - Infected: I have thoughts like this, if you understood everything about the universe, would you think in equations or pictures?
02/08/17, 23:43 - FABIO: even more.. it has no AV.. or firewall.. most of the time
02/08/17, 23:44 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Pictures
02/08/17, 23:44 - FABIO: equations...
02/08/17, 23:44 - FABIO: hahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:44 - Infected: See? Lol
02/08/17, 23:44 - FABIO: probably equations..
02/08/17, 23:44 - FABIO: probability is an equation..
02/08/17, 23:44 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I think someone hacked my phone and that they are reading all my convos on whatsapp
02/08/17, 23:45 - Janith: Why not both?
02/08/17, 23:45 - Infected: Two people look at a picture, one person sees a snail, the other a fibonnaci spiral.
02/08/17, 23:45 - Janith: Equations can be used to judge the objects according to principles
02/08/17, 23:45 - FABIO: probably not... depends on your friends
02/08/17, 23:45 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I dont like maths that much xd
02/08/17, 23:45 - Infected: That's a definite possibility.
02/08/17, 23:45 - Janith: The pictures are just the raw input
02/08/17, 23:45 - FABIO: actual hackers.. dont care about you.. just your IP. and computer power.
02/08/17, 23:46 - FABIO: or credit card password
02/08/17, 23:46 - FABIO: hahahahaha
02/08/17, 23:46 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Like someone who wants to know about me no my personal information
02/08/17, 23:46 - Tahnacious: I have interest, a topic I'd be happy to research more. Busy reading chat first ^^;
02/08/17, 23:47 - FABIO: no... they need your computer.. to do the illigal hacking.. so when they hack government or something.. its your ip they track
02/08/17, 23:47 - Infected: I need to read more about physics. I'm awfully ignorant for an intp.
02/08/17, 23:47 - FABIO: not theyrs
02/08/17, 23:47 - FABIO: BUT
02/08/17, 23:47 - Tahnacious: This
02/08/17, 23:47 - FABIO: if you have a friend.. who actually knows how to hack....
02/08/17, 23:47 - FABIO: he will probably read and spy on you
02/08/17, 23:47 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I know. More especifically i think that every time I take a picture they receive a copy of it in computer
02/08/17, 23:48 - FABIO: thats why we became hackers in the first place.
02/08/17, 23:48 - Janith: You know.. This group really could be like a primitive hive mind for us
02/08/17, 23:48 - FABIO: i changed my roommates wallpaper.. to a LOT. of dick picks....
02/08/17, 23:48 - FABIO: just beocuse i can.
02/08/17, 23:48 - Infected: I used to think people at the grocery store were following me around and reporting on my activities to the fbi.
02/08/17, 23:49 - Janith: Whenever we have a problem that can't be solved using only our brains we just use the processing power of around 60 other INTPs
02/08/17, 23:49 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: He knows how to do it so i am sure of it
02/08/17, 23:49 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I want to be a hacker too
02/08/17, 23:49 - Janith: Did you do anything that would give the fbi a reason to be interested in you?
02/08/17, 23:49 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: That sounds a lot like me
02/08/17, 23:50 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: She knows a lot of things that normal ppl don't I bet
02/08/17, 23:50 - Infected: No, it's not about that. Logically, I know the fbi would have no interest in me. It's mind over mind.
02/08/17, 23:50 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
02/08/17, 23:51 - Janith: Teach me Oh great bearded one 🙇
02/08/17, 23:51 - Infected: I'm a pretentious fuck but even I don't think I have a revolutionary concept about anything.
02/08/17, 23:52 - Janith: You're smart. Considering the current government that's as big a threat as any 😂
02/08/17, 23:53 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Goald
02/08/17, 23:53 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Goals
02/08/17, 23:53 - FABIO: hahahahaahaa
02/08/17, 23:53 - FABIO: just use linux
02/08/17, 23:53 - FABIO: learn how to code
02/08/17, 23:53 - Infected: I'm capable of putting 2 and 2 together. I don't think that's strange lol
02/08/17, 23:53 - FABIO: the rest is books..
02/08/17, 23:54 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Uhm
02/08/17, 23:54 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I will try
02/08/17, 23:54 - Janith: In a country that puts value on stupidity... Anything can be strange 😂
02/08/17, 23:54 - Infected: I read a little bit about coding when I was a teenager. I got so far as developing malware and then I got bored with it. Forgot everything I learned.
02/08/17, 23:54 - Janith: Sweet. First Linux. Then books
02/08/17, 23:55 - FABIO: hahaha
02/08/17, 23:55 - FABIO: coding is nice.... it actually helps a lot your life
02/08/17, 23:55 - Janith: That's my current problem. I get bored with most things that aren't directly related to my life goals
02/08/17, 23:55 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Like?
02/08/17, 23:55 - Infected: I don't think I'm strange. To other people, I'm a pariah. It's none of my business what other people think of me. They probably listen to Josh Groban anyway.
02/08/17, 23:55 - Janith: I can't figure out how to apply it
02/08/17, 23:56 - FABIO: every semester i have to do my inscrition and choose my classes
02/08/17, 23:56 - FABIO: i made a bot... to do it for me
02/08/17, 23:56 - FABIO: so i dont miss the date....
02/08/17, 23:56 - Janith: I think you're strange ☺
I think everyone in this group is strange. That's what makes it so interesting
02/08/17, 23:56 - FABIO: or the library.. we have 1 week to stay with books.. but you can renew and stay with them for 3 weeks
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: another boot.. doing it for me.
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: bot(
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: bot*
02/08/17, 23:57 - Janith: All Linux?
02/08/17, 23:57 - Infected: I don't think any of you are strange.
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: i have my own server... to download and watch series
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: i can watch from any device... in home
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: or can put to download.. from any device too
02/08/17, 23:57 - FABIO: torrent is in a web page...
02/08/17, 23:58 - FABIO: linux
02/08/17, 23:58 - FABIO: is life
02/08/17, 23:58 - Janith: Yeah I have a problem. Strange us supposed to be negative but I have trouble processing insults 😂
02/08/17, 23:58 - Janith: My brain takes insults as compliments
02/08/17, 23:58 - FABIO: i just dont care.
02/08/17, 23:58 - FABIO: hahahahah
02/08/17, 23:59 - Janith: I wouldn't either if it wasn't great fun 😂
02/08/17, 23:59 - Infected: I think people that don't read wikileaks and don't think it's more than a coincidence when 5+ people connected to one person all die under suspicious circumstances. That makes me a conspiracy theorist. Common sense to me.
03/08/17, 00:00 - FABIO: i have a cod.. that analyses whatsapp group chats... then you put it in an excell.. you have graphics of who sent how many messages in what hour of the thay.... or how many messages per month
03/08/17, 00:00 - Infected: I'd like to see the diagram of that.
03/08/17, 00:00 - Janith: Can we get a revised analysis now that we have new members
03/08/17, 00:00 - FABIO: i posted it once....
03/08/17, 00:01 - Janith: Would be interesting to see the updated statistics
03/08/17, 00:01 - FABIO: i have to add them....
03/08/17, 00:01 - FABIO: but will do
03/08/17, 00:01 - FABIO: =D
03/08/17, 00:01 - Janith: Sweet. 😁
03/08/17, 00:01 - FABIO: couldnt make the code works... with phone numbers...
03/08/17, 00:02 - Janith: So that's why you used names the first time?
03/08/17, 00:02 - FABIO: yes.
03/08/17, 00:02 - FABIO: and just form a few ones
03/08/17, 00:02 - FABIO: the others i didnt had added
03/08/17, 00:02 - FABIO: so the code just ignores them
03/08/17, 00:03 - FABIO: but... yet the most usefull one.. is a code i did to solve....
03/08/17, 00:03 - FABIO: to escalonate matris..
03/08/17, 00:03 - FABIO: matrix
03/08/17, 00:03 - FABIO: hmmm
03/08/17, 00:04 - FABIO: matrix.
03/08/17, 00:04 - Tahnacious: Maybe the simulation we are hypothetically in runs off the power of our pollution lol
03/08/17, 00:04 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: My dad is an Intj
03/08/17, 00:04 - FABIO: sorry to hear that
03/08/17, 00:04 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Now I want to make the test to everyone to know everything. About them
03/08/17, 00:05 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: It is that bad?
03/08/17, 00:05 - Infected: I sympathize. I'm very similar to an intj.
03/08/17, 00:05 - FABIO: or.. you could.. you know.. TALK. to them
03/08/17, 00:05 - FABIO: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
03/08/17, 00:06 - Infected: I had everyone that I come in constant contact with take the test. Well, the people I'm in contact with by choice.
03/08/17, 00:06 - Janith: 😂
03/08/17, 00:06 - Janith: I find INTJs are good in limited doses
03/08/17, 00:06 - FABIO: its not that i dont like intj... is that the only one i knew.... is way overpowered
03/08/17, 00:06 - Infected: I realized that I mostly gravitate towards intp's.
03/08/17, 00:07 - FABIO: that guy need a debuff...
03/08/17, 00:07 - Janith: Well... We are the best
03/08/17, 00:07 - Janith: And laziest
03/08/17, 00:07 - Infected: The least irritating.
03/08/17, 00:07 - Janith: OP how?
03/08/17, 00:07 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: My dad and I get along quite nicely
03/08/17, 00:08 - FABIO: we studyed together.... i am an failing engineering student.. he is the youngest diplomat in brazil history....
03/08/17, 00:08 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Something we cannot agree to some things but wtvs
03/08/17, 00:09 - FABIO: he earns 5k dollars a month
03/08/17, 00:09 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Some times
03/08/17, 00:09 - FABIO: the guys is rich.. and has my age.. :(
03/08/17, 00:09 - Janith: My ex is INTJ. She's not really OP at all
03/08/17, 00:09 - Tahnacious: Kind of like Schrödinger's cat
03/08/17, 00:09 - Infected: That's not much?
03/08/17, 00:09 - FABIO: that is tottally much.. if you have 22 years old.. living alone
03/08/17, 00:10 - Janith: Isn't that a normal salary?
03/08/17, 00:10 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: What does OP stands for?
03/08/17, 00:10 - FABIO: im in brazil
03/08/17, 00:10 - Infected: That's minimum wage in the u.s.
03/08/17, 00:10 - Janith: Amounts to around 60k per year
03/08/17, 00:10 - FABIO: here the ground salary is. 200 dollars a month
03/08/17, 00:10 - Janith: Oh yeah... Whoops 😅
03/08/17, 00:11 - Infected: Ahhhh. Right. I forget about the differences in cost of living between countries.
03/08/17, 00:12 - FABIO: so you to know....
03/08/17, 00:12 - Janith: I don't know why monthly earnings reminded me to take my meds 😂
03/08/17, 00:12 - FABIO: he earns 19k BR$ ..... the NORMAL.. salary after college.... like one from my engineer friend.... he earns 1200 BR$
03/08/17, 00:12 - Infected: I went off my meds years ago.
03/08/17, 00:13 - Janith: Here's the thing though, personally I consider being an engineer much better than a diplomat
03/08/17, 00:13 - Janith: Oh. What for?
03/08/17, 00:13 - Infected: Same.
03/08/17, 00:13 - FABIO: me too.. but he has way more money....
03/08/17, 00:13 - FABIO: hahahahahha
03/08/17, 00:13 - Infected: They didn't work to my satisfaction.
03/08/17, 00:14 - Janith: Yeah.. But he also has to talk with politicians and the like for a living 😂
03/08/17, 00:14 - FABIO: well.. he likes
03/08/17, 00:14 - FABIO: hahahaha
03/08/17, 00:14 - Infected: People-ey professions are definitely less desirable.
03/08/17, 00:15 - Janith: Honestly I wouldn't mind making a fraction of that if u can have a job where I get to be silent most of the time
03/08/17, 00:15 - FABIO: i love money
03/08/17, 00:15 - FABIO: to me.. money is freedom
03/08/17, 00:15 - Janith: Charlie Chaplin had a good job 😆
03/08/17, 00:15 - Janith: No I mean what did you take them for?
03/08/17, 00:16 - Infected: I get a crazy check from the government. Prior to that I worked 80+ hrs a week. Being poor is definitely less aggravating.
03/08/17, 00:16 - Janith: Money is chains and a means to an end to me
03/08/17, 00:16 - FABIO: well.. im a engineer... my toys are expensive
03/08/17, 00:16 - Infected: So I wouldn't have the urge to kill people or myself.
03/08/17, 00:16 - FABIO: i need money in life
03/08/17, 00:16 - FABIO: hahahahaha
03/08/17, 00:17 - Janith: Wow. Busy bee you were. What do you do btw?
03/08/17, 00:17 - Infected: I was a cna. I took care of dying people.
03/08/17, 00:17 - Janith: Same here. Though after taking my meds I just want to kill people 😊
03/08/17, 00:17 - Tahnacious: I wish it was a normal salary, I earn between 2-3k and work crazy hours. Usually closer to 2
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: am i the only old intp...
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: WHO DOESNT DO MEDS?
03/08/17, 00:18 - Janith: You're not old yet 😆
03/08/17, 00:18 - Janith: You'll find yourself eventually 😂
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: well. we have a lot of 15.16 here
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: so i fell old
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: hahahaha
03/08/17, 00:18 - Infected: I just said I don't take meds.
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: and some of then do meds too
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: by choice... but you did
03/08/17, 00:18 - FABIO: i never did
03/08/17, 00:19 - Tahnacious: I took antidepressants for a while
03/08/17, 00:19 - Tahnacious: 8 years
03/08/17, 00:19 - Tahnacious: Finally caught up with chat
03/08/17, 00:19 - Infected: I did because it was either that or be institutionalized.
03/08/17, 00:19 - FABIO: SEE...
03/08/17, 00:20 - Tahnacious: They were SSRIs and it just so happens that my genetics block the receptors for then so they had no effect on me whatsoever. Thus why I was stagnant for so long.
03/08/17, 00:20 - Janith: Personally I've had a really good experience with my meds. 
Stops the need to kill myself, dampens my emotions, and kills the hyperactive teenage libido 😂
03/08/17, 00:20 - Infected: I didn't have a choice, therapy and medication or be in a state run mental facility.
03/08/17, 00:20 - Janith: So far I have yet to find a downside
03/08/17, 00:21 - FABIO: dont know why so many of you are unhappy with life
03/08/17, 00:21 - Janith: Yikes. Because you were suicidal?
03/08/17, 00:21 - Tahnacious: Downside for me was paying $$$ for what was merely a short term placebo effect
03/08/17, 00:21 - FABIO: this shit... is the only things we are able to do
03/08/17, 00:21 - Infected: That's what they decided.
03/08/17, 00:21 - Tahnacious: I hate life :)
03/08/17, 00:21 - Tahnacious: I am happy with hating life, does that sound weird?
03/08/17, 00:21 - Janith: Not unhappy. Just couldn't shake my suicidal feelings
03/08/17, 00:21 - FABIO: yes
03/08/17, 00:22 - Infected: The next time I have an "episode" it will be mandatory evaluation. Meh
03/08/17, 00:22 - Tahnacious: I think I'll eventually get to the point where no one is dependant on me and "kick the bucket"
03/08/17, 00:22 - Janith: I never acted on them cause I had an end goal I had to achieve before I allowed myself to commit suicide but the thoughts were persistent
03/08/17, 00:22 - FABIO: why
03/08/17, 00:22 - FABIO: why waste this thing
03/08/17, 00:22 - Infected: Not to me. If you aren't questioning existence what's the point of you? Imo
03/08/17, 00:22 - Tahnacious: Yeah, this.
03/08/17, 00:23 - FABIO: you have only one life.. and you hate it
03/08/17, 00:23 - FABIO: just jump.
03/08/17, 00:23 - Tahnacious: But this thing isn't even good! Lok
03/08/17, 00:23 - Tahnacious: *lol
03/08/17, 00:23 - Janith: Yaaass
03/08/17, 00:23 - FABIO: no point on waste atoms in your ungratefull boddy
03/08/17, 00:23 - Janith: Not hate. Just don't care 😊
03/08/17, 00:23 - Infected: I don't hate my life. I resent my existence to a large degree.
03/08/17, 00:23 - Tahnacious: I have dependent animals and a curiosity of whether I'll ever be able to animate or not. Other than that I have no purpose.
03/08/17, 00:24 - FABIO: you are just helping to increace entropy...
03/08/17, 00:24 - Tahnacious: Animate in both senses. Get up and do things or do animation as a career
03/08/17, 00:24 - Janith: @554691068741 you're probably the closest to "normal" an INTP will get 😂
03/08/17, 00:24 - FABIO: hahahahaha
03/08/17, 00:24 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Lol me
03/08/17, 00:24 - FABIO: probably...
03/08/17, 00:24 - FABIO: i actually enjoy life
03/08/17, 00:25 - FABIO: really
03/08/17, 00:25 - Tahnacious: Howwwww?
03/08/17, 00:25 - Janith: It's sad that we aren't closer to the point where the universe dies of entropy
03/08/17, 00:25 - FABIO: i found a thing i love doing
03/08/17, 00:25 - Janith: Would be nice to see
03/08/17, 00:25 - Infected: We are alive because someone else created us without thinking of the consequences of it. It aggravates me.
03/08/17, 00:25 - FABIO: omg... haahhahaa
03/08/17, 00:25 - Tahnacious: I don't think I've truly enjoyed living since I was a little child at Christmas.
03/08/17, 00:25 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: I don't hate life, I just hate having to live
03/08/17, 00:25 - Janith: Me too. But I still don't care for living
03/08/17, 00:25 - Janith: 👆👆👆
03/08/17, 00:25 - Tahnacious: I don't have anything I love doing.
03/08/17, 00:26 - FABIO: i fucking love this thing.. its misterys.... its feelings.... all of it
03/08/17, 00:26 - Tahnacious: Seconded.
03/08/17, 00:26 - FABIO: to me.. good or bad are just emotions.. and i actually enjoy having both
03/08/17, 00:26 - Janith: Sometimes I wonder if the robots we create (if they were sentient) are luckier than us
03/08/17, 00:26 - Tahnacious: I once wrote about how I wish I had strangled on my umbilical cord at birth.
03/08/17, 00:27 - Infected: I enjoy information. I enjoy studying humanity. I don't particularly enjoy being alive.
03/08/17, 00:27 - Tahnacious: I wasn't going to live so they did emergency c-sec
03/08/17, 00:27 - Janith: Consider the butter passing robot in rick and morty. At least his existence has an ultimate purpose
03/08/17, 00:27 - Tahnacious: I think that was stupid hah
03/08/17, 00:27 - Janith: He can judge the value of his existence in an objective fashion
03/08/17, 00:27 - FABIO: hmmm curious.. i do
03/08/17, 00:27 - Janith: Same here 😁
03/08/17, 00:28 - Janith: I generally enjoy watching certain human interactions too. Dynamic systems
03/08/17, 00:28 - Tahnacious: Everything requires just so much effort and no true reward...
03/08/17, 00:28 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I love life I just hate the people that also live
03/08/17, 00:28 - Tahnacious: I suck at understanding real world human interaction :(
03/08/17, 00:28 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: You wouldn't enjoy emotions if you had depression lol
03/08/17, 00:29 - FABIO: or i dont have depression.. becouse i enjoy them?
03/08/17, 00:29 - Janith: Study psychology!
03/08/17, 00:29 - Janith: It's great fun
03/08/17, 00:29 - ‪+52 1 999 997 8781‬: Have you watched Butterfly effect?
03/08/17, 00:29 - FABIO: i actually do have panic crysis?? is it how its called?
03/08/17, 00:29 - Infected: That robot had a purpose that he was assigned. He was essentially created to do nothing but pass butter. He had no choice about his creation, no input on his purpose. He was created to feel nothing and do nothing but a simple task. He was not created to have a deeper meaning or understanding. That is smart but irresponsible, imo
03/08/17, 00:29 - FABIO: that astounshing fear... of no explanation
03/08/17, 00:29 - Infected: Great movie.
03/08/17, 00:30 - Shaiju: Btw... Who are all planning to die tonight?🤔
03/08/17, 00:30 - FABIO: but i do manage to controll it
03/08/17, 00:30 - FABIO: the first time i had... i saw it was not me.... so.. i just went up. watched a movie.. and waited it to pass.
03/08/17, 00:30 - Infected: I don't hate people. I'd just rather not be near them.
03/08/17, 00:31 - Janith: I totally agree but I can't deny that the robot has meaning and a purpose to its existence while we don't. He was brought into the world purposefully and we weren't
03/08/17, 00:31 - Tahnacious: I've tried, I understand it in theory but not in practice. Too many people don't mean what they say and gesture subtly and I don't notice
03/08/17, 00:31 - Tahnacious: Yes
03/08/17, 00:31 - Infected: Is it right to create something that can't question it's existence?
03/08/17, 00:31 - FABIO: ask god
03/08/17, 00:31 - Janith: I really hope that if I have a girlfriend in the future she'll be like you 😂
03/08/17, 00:32 - FABIO: mine.. has fewer friends.. than me
03/08/17, 00:32 - Infected: I am not a follower of abrahamic religions.
03/08/17, 00:32 - FABIO: and goes out... WAAAYY less than me..
03/08/17, 00:32 - Janith: I don't belive in a right and wrong. The robot was created
03/08/17, 00:33 - Infected: Similar but not exactly like me, hopefully. You'll be miserable.
03/08/17, 00:33 - Janith: It has the opportunity to enjoy almost everything it can while still having purpose in life
03/08/17, 00:33 - Infected: If you create a life, even an artificial one, do you have a responsibility to it?
03/08/17, 00:34 - FABIO: enjoy.. without emotions?
03/08/17, 00:34 - FABIO: no
03/08/17, 00:34 - Infected: It's only purpose is to pass butter. It has no capabilities to understand enjoyment or desire.
03/08/17, 00:34 - Janith: Aww but so far I'm enjoying everything about you. And I doubt two INTPs can be that miserable for long 😂
03/08/17, 00:35 - Infected: Awkward.
03/08/17, 00:35 - FABIO: is that.. a mariage proposal?
03/08/17, 00:35 - Janith: Sure if you give yourself the responsibility
03/08/17, 00:35 - Janith: Nope 😂 no relationships for me right now
03/08/17, 00:35 - FABIO: hahaha
03/08/17, 00:36 - Infected: That's why the idea of a god like being is interesting to me.
03/08/17, 00:36 - Janith: Just mentioned that I really like @15015198024 as an individual
03/08/17, 00:36 - Shaiju: Satan has his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and detested.

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein

03/08/17, 00:36 - Infected: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
03/08/17, 00:36 - FABIO: great book...
03/08/17, 00:36 - FABIO: really liked the monster
03/08/17, 00:37 - Janith: What's the book?
03/08/17, 00:37 - FABIO: frankenstein
03/08/17, 00:37 - Infected: One of the best written creatures, imo
03/08/17, 00:37 - Janith: Oh 😂
I'll be sure to check it out
03/08/17, 00:38 - Shaiju: The monster in you?... We have many lives inside us... waiting to be exposed..
03/08/17, 00:38 - Infected: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is also good. I look at it from a psychological standpoint and it's fascinating.
03/08/17, 00:38 - Janith: Sounds like DID though
03/08/17, 00:38 - Didier: I read it for Literature 😂
03/08/17, 00:39 - FABIO: hmmm... dont know
03/08/17, 00:39 - Didier: But it was my first time in Literature class so I barely knew what was happening 😂
03/08/17, 00:39 - Infected: If you don't think humans are monsters, you have more problems than I do.
03/08/17, 00:40 - Shaiju: Lol...😂
03/08/17, 00:40 - Infected: Read Hamlet. It'll blow your shit.
03/08/17, 00:40 - FABIO: dont think humans are monsters.... shure some are really bad... the problem is they live
03/08/17, 00:40 - Didier: Yeah I've always wanted to read it
03/08/17, 00:40 - Janith: Humans are quite fascinating in our capacity to inflict pain on others
03/08/17, 00:40 - FABIO: 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
03/08/17, 00:40 - Didier: I even heard that it's banned in some other countries
03/08/17, 00:41 - Infected: LOL everything good is banned somewhere.
03/08/17, 00:41 - Didier: Yeah,it's sad when books are banned
03/08/17, 00:41 - Infected: Every human being on earth is capable of great darkness. Believe it.
03/08/17, 00:41 - Didier: And usually they are quite the fascinating ones
03/08/17, 00:41 - FABIO: they should ban the bible
03/08/17, 00:41 - Didier: 😂
03/08/17, 00:42 - Didier: Right
03/08/17, 00:42 - Janith: Bible, Quran
03/08/17, 00:42 - Infected: I'm personally offended by censorship.
03/08/17, 00:42 - Janith: Any book that's religious 😂
03/08/17, 00:42 - Didier: Same
03/08/17, 00:42 - Infected: I've read the Q'Uran. It's better than the bible, tbh.
03/08/17, 00:42 - FABIO: they should ask god for a copy....
03/08/17, 00:42 - Didier: I don't care if u ban cannibalism shows on tv bc kids can watch them but
03/08/17, 00:42 - FABIO: not use human inventions and buy printed ones
03/08/17, 00:42 - Janith: Censorship is mostly pointless now anyway
03/08/17, 00:42 - Didier: The ability to retrieve them is gone?
03/08/17, 00:43 - Janith: Better how? I haven't read either so I don't really know
03/08/17, 00:43 - Shaiju: Some people think it is better for them to deside what is good for others than letting them deside as they may faulter!... It's just lending a helping hand for the hapless souls..
03/08/17, 00:44 - Infected: The Bible is basically a how to on killing, raping, slavery and never questioning authority.
03/08/17, 00:44 - Janith: But cannibalism isn't that bad. There should just be a disclaimer stating that human meat is pretty unhealthy so only consume it as a last resort
03/08/17, 00:44 - FABIO: it makes me want read again.... amasing descryption
03/08/17, 00:44 - Didier: Exactly.We are brainwashed to be obedient citizens.What's next?
03/08/17, 00:44 - FABIO: looks like song of ice and fire
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: it even has a lord of ligth
03/08/17, 00:45 - Janith: Wow 😂
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: that brings dead back
03/08/17, 00:45 - Infected: Not much difference, tbh
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: is that what the bible is...
03/08/17, 00:45 - Janith: Okay I knew the Bible was bad but I didn't know it was this bad
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: a song of ice and fire.. from a few years back
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: people just understand it wrong?
03/08/17, 00:45 - FABIO: hahahahahhaahhahahaha
03/08/17, 00:45 - Infected: Read it.
03/08/17, 00:45 - Janith: The prequel maybe?
03/08/17, 00:46 - FABIO: 🤣🤣
03/08/17, 00:46 - Infected: This.
03/08/17, 00:46 - FABIO: IT EVEN KILLS.. THE MAIN CHARACTER
03/08/17, 00:46 - Didier: If Jesus was real,he should be an intuitive
03/08/17, 00:46 - FABIO: LOOOL.. in going to hell for that
03/08/17, 00:46 - Janith: I started but I barely finished the first sentence. It was nauseating how stupid it was
03/08/17, 00:46 - Didier: 😂
03/08/17, 00:47 - Infected: The Bible was put together by a group of old men that had a singular vision.
03/08/17, 00:47 - Didier: It shows the ugly side of humanity too
03/08/17, 00:47 - Infected: I read the Bible the first time when I was a kid. I read a lot.
03/08/17, 00:48 - FABIO: make ROME GREAT AGAIN
03/08/17, 00:48 - Janith: "In the beginning God.." 

Wait wait wait. What beginning? The big bang? Or before that? And how did this beginning come about? Who is this God. How did he get there? Etc etc.
03/08/17, 00:48 - Infected: The Niacine Council led by Constantine.
03/08/17, 00:48 - FABIO: in a role in the ground.. lived a hobbit... WAAAYY BETER BEGINING for a book
03/08/17, 00:49 - Janith: It felt like reading the Lord of the rings but starting from the third book
03/08/17, 00:49 - Janith: You feel like you missed the first volume
03/08/17, 00:49 - FABIO: silmarilion.. if you want to get the world.. rigth
03/08/17, 00:49 - Janith: So how does the Quran explain stuff?
03/08/17, 00:50 - Didier: 😂Fabio.U should now learn to become an author.I can imagine u being inspired by other works
03/08/17, 00:50 - Infected: Because it wasn't a cohesive unit. It was a collection of writings from all over the roman empire. It was written by many people and more was left out than put in.
03/08/17, 00:50 - FABIO: hahahaa... thanks... i writed a few... when i was wanting a girl that was a writer
03/08/17, 00:50 - FABIO: good old times
03/08/17, 00:51 - Janith: We INTPs should write books. We'd make for pretty good authors if we ever get to finishing our work 😂
03/08/17, 00:51 - Didier: I agree 😂
03/08/17, 00:51 - Janith: The Quran?
03/08/17, 00:51 - Didier: Maybe start with shorter stories?
03/08/17, 00:51 - Infected: I don't think I've ever finished a story that wasn't graded.
03/08/17, 00:51 - Infected: The Bible. Probably both, really lol
03/08/17, 00:52 - FABIO: guys
03/08/17, 00:52 - Janith: Same. My brother is an INFP and he was writing a book sometime back. Much more consistent than I ever was
03/08/17, 00:52 - FABIO: im going to play CS GO

03/08/17, 00:53 - FABIO: thanks =D
03/08/17, 00:53 - Infected: I researched it at one time.
03/08/17, 00:53 - Didier: ENJOY FABIO
03/08/17, 00:53 - Janith: Yeah. But it's more like two differently colored cars than two different types of vehicles
03/08/17, 00:54 - Didier: No need to thank me haha
03/08/17, 00:54 - Infected: Muslims are generally less up tight than Christians, ime
03/08/17, 00:54 - Amin: My point is christian are alot more strict
03/08/17, 00:54 - Didier: Really?
03/08/17, 00:54 - Amin: Exactly
03/08/17, 00:55 - Janith: I think I'm gonna go too. I should get some work done. See you guys later 😊
03/08/17, 00:55 - Janith: True
03/08/17, 00:55 - Amin: Christian doesnt think
03/08/17, 00:55 - Amin: Have dun janith
03/08/17, 00:55 - Infected: I live in the bible belt. I'm definitely sure.
03/08/17, 00:55 - Didier: I think that it's because there are many Christians in the world,uptight ones or not.But usually,the uptight ones represent them and give off a bad image.
03/08/17, 00:55 - Infected: 👋🏻
03/08/17, 00:55 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I write books I even published one
03/08/17, 00:56 - Didier: See ya
03/08/17, 00:56 - Infected: I published a poem once. It was shite.
03/08/17, 00:56 - Didier: Wow.What book?
03/08/17, 00:56 - Didier: Now I'm curious
03/08/17, 00:56 - Infected: Same
03/08/17, 00:57 - Tahnacious: This
03/08/17, 00:57 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I made the test again just in case I was wrong and I got intp again
03/08/17, 00:57 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Yes. It is a novel
03/08/17, 00:57 - Tahnacious: But on the other hand, this
03/08/17, 00:57 - Infected: I always get intp. I've gotten intj twice.
03/08/17, 00:57 - Didier: 😂
03/08/17, 00:57 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Of course in Spanish since that is my first language
03/08/17, 00:58 - Didier: Maybe INTx?The best is self-exploration
03/08/17, 00:58 - Didier: Tell us the name
03/08/17, 00:58 - Infected: I'm intp-a. I'm not focused enough to be intj.
03/08/17, 00:58 - Didier: Okay I can't understand Spanish too bad lol...
03/08/17, 00:59 - Infected: I get intj if I take the test when I'm having mood swings.
03/08/17, 00:59 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Sometimes I feel that I can't relate to anyone xd
Intp-t
03/08/17, 00:59 - Didier: Hmm not surprised
03/08/17, 01:00 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I want to translate it and publish it in English xd
03/08/17, 01:00 - Didier: Try it.
03/08/17, 01:00 - Didier: Because I will be reading
03/08/17, 01:00 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: It is called nothing
03/08/17, 01:00 - Didier: By Gaby?
03/08/17, 01:00 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Yes
03/08/17, 01:00 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Well Gabriela
03/08/17, 01:01 - Didier: What is it about?
03/08/17, 01:01 - Didier: Since I won't understand
03/08/17, 01:03 - Tahnacious: I don't mind reading it
03/08/17, 01:03 - Tahnacious: I am learning Spanish
03/08/17, 01:03 - Tahnacious: I intend to be fluent eventually
03/08/17, 01:05 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: A 17 y/o asks the mysterious boy in the neighborhood to take her virginity so her friends would accept her again in their group of friends. 

Later they develop a no-relationship but she falls for him and tben there it goes
03/08/17, 01:05 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Where do u live?
03/08/17, 01:05 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: I mean the country
03/08/17, 01:07 - Tahnacious: Australia
03/08/17, 01:08 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Maybe amazon or busca libre .com can ship to Australia
03/08/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 01:09 - Tahnacious: My cat does the dog thing...
03/08/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: Possibly. I can give it a go
03/08/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 01:16 - Tahnacious: Found that too. Lol
03/08/17, 01:18 - Infected: Haha
03/08/17, 01:19 - Infected: I couldn't find the book on Amazon
03/08/17, 01:26 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Let me search a link
03/08/17, 01:27 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: https://www.amazon.es/Nada-%C2%BFPuede-deseo-convertirse-amor/dp/8416281971
03/08/17, 01:32 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 01:32 - Infected: You've got a 5 star review
03/08/17, 01:32 - Tahnacious: Bookmarked it for future reference. In other words when I have time to read new material ^^;
03/08/17, 01:32 - Infected: Same.
03/08/17, 01:33 - Infected: I'll be buying it next month.
03/08/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 01:33 - Tahnacious: I am possibly having too much fun making gifs
03/08/17, 01:33 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: Yes❣💕

03/08/17, 01:33 - Infected: I also use Wattpad.
03/08/17, 01:34 - Tahnacious: Excuse me human, I know you're behind this sorcery. Explain.
03/08/17, 01:34 - Infected: My book is nowhere near finished, though. I probably won't ever finish it.
03/08/17, 01:34 - Infected: Nice gif's
03/08/17, 01:35 - Tahnacious: He has a very interesting personality. I want to try typing animals.
03/08/17, 01:37 - Shaiju: Wow! extremely useful in every day conversations! Thoughtful gifs. Why wasn't there one before?😉
03/08/17, 01:37 - Tahnacious: Hahah
03/08/17, 01:42 - Infected: I find gif's extremely useful in communication.
03/08/17, 01:43 - Shaiju: Like this one😂 so much details in few seconds!
03/08/17, 01:44 - Shaiju: Yeah👆🏻
03/08/17, 02:01 - Amin: Hoooooot

03/08/17, 02:01 - Amin: Mu dear mushroom 👋👋
03/08/17, 02:02 - Amin: How should I use gifs here?
03/08/17, 02:02 - Infected: When I have trouble communicating a thought to someone, I find gif's to be helpful.
03/08/17, 02:02 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 02:03 - Amin: Very smart way
03/08/17, 02:03 - Amin: Its very good that u cant use ur mind
03/08/17, 02:03 - Amin: So I can

03/08/17, 02:04 - Amin: Bye for now 👋
03/08/17, 02:09 - Infected: You're not smart enough to get inside my head.

03/08/17, 02:21 - Amin: Im gonna tell u all s.th as monster

03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: All the thoughts
03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: All the theories
03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: All the unfocused minda
03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: Minds*
03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: I know u suffer from ur intelligence
03/08/17, 02:22 - Amin: This is what helps

03/08/17, 02:24 - Amin: P.s : Ritalin always helps
03/08/17, 02:38 - Infected: No.
03/08/17, 02:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Quick question: is the MBTI test really accurate?
03/08/17, 02:56 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Because it's impossible to answer it subjectively
03/08/17, 02:58 - Infected: It depends on your definition of accurate. It'll be more helpful than reading your horoscope.

Mm. I don't think it's meant to be subjective. It's a personality test. You answer as related to how you would normally act under the scenarios presented.
03/08/17, 02:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: This should be proof of it's flaw
03/08/17, 02:59 - Infected: It is flawed. It's a soft science.
03/08/17, 02:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Then why ate there people' the INTP subreddit, treat it as an absolute?
03/08/17, 03:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The INTP subreddit for example*
03/08/17, 03:00 - Infected: Because they have a personal attachment to the subject matter, probably.
03/08/17, 03:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Half of the posts belong on r/iamverysmart
03/08/17, 03:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I feel ashamed when I read it
03/08/17, 03:02 - Infected: Mbti is just a template for determining base programming. Every intp will have differences in personality and behavior. You determine which functions to build up and which to ignore.
03/08/17, 03:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I understand that
03/08/17, 03:03 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's impossible to accurately class 7 billion people into 16 groups
03/08/17, 03:03 - Infected: Improbable. I wouldn't say impossible.
03/08/17, 03:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Impossible if everyone's pandering about 'individualism' and 'uniqueness' is true
03/08/17, 03:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Which it probably isn't
03/08/17, 03:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ugh, I'm an 18 year old that is trying to judge an entire race...
03/08/17, 03:06 - Infected: Everyone is unique, just like everyone else. We all have reasons for our personalities being the way they are. We have similar base functions but they were developed separately under a wide range of scenarios that are unique to each individual.
03/08/17, 03:07 - Infected: Study the human race before judging it, just my opinion.
03/08/17, 03:07 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah, I'm acting like the subreddit
03/08/17, 03:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Talking before knowing what I speak of
03/08/17, 03:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I tried phrasing that differently
03/08/17, 03:08 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Doesn't have the ring it had in my mind
03/08/17, 03:09 - Infected: Information is more important than bias. If you already know what you want the outcome to be, it'll effect your study.
03/08/17, 03:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmm
03/08/17, 03:10 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I heard something similar when an ex-feminist spoke about her experiences in trying to prove mysogony
03/08/17, 03:11 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Misogony?
03/08/17, 03:11 - Infected: Misogyny
03/08/17, 03:12 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The -yny felt wrong, so I disregarded it
03/08/17, 03:12 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But it has a greek origin, so I guess it's normal
03/08/17, 03:13 - Infected: It's an odd word. It looks differently than it should based on the pronunciation.
03/08/17, 03:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I think words with uropean origin would have the g prononced in a harder way?
03/08/17, 03:14 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Like in gold?
03/08/17, 03:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I don't know
03/08/17, 03:15 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Halphazard guess
03/08/17, 03:16 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I think I used up my quota for psuedo intellectualism for today
03/08/17, 03:18 - Infected: Well, in words like gynecology, the g would be pronounced that way. I am not 100% positive but the pronunciation would seem likely to depend on the letters placement within the word itself, no matter the origin. Every base origin does appear to be somewhat distant but you can get a good handle on pronunciation by seeing the positioning of each letter.
03/08/17, 03:18 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'm on the wikipedia page right now
03/08/17, 03:19 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 03:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I was kind of right
03/08/17, 03:20 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I'd have gotten 1 out of 3 in a test
03/08/17, 03:20 - Infected: Makes more sense than the way I explained it.
03/08/17, 03:21 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: If there were digital wonders, like the world wonders or wonders of the nutural word, wikipedia would be in the top 3
03/08/17, 03:23 - Infected: I like Wikipedia but I still think Encyclopedias are a more accurate interpretation of information.
03/08/17, 03:23 - Infected: Not many people have them anymore.
03/08/17, 03:23 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Encyclopedias are expensive though
03/08/17, 03:24 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And they can't be updated, whuch is good and bad
03/08/17, 03:24 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Which*
03/08/17, 03:27 - Infected: True.
03/08/17, 03:27 - Infected: Also true, but I was under the impression that almost anyone could update Wikipedia articles.
03/08/17, 03:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They can, which is why I said it's bad
03/08/17, 03:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Anyone can go to the mitochandria page and change it to midichlorians
03/08/17, 03:28 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I think someone did
03/08/17, 03:29 - Infected: https://www.britannica.com


Encyclopedia.
03/08/17, 03:30 - Infected: Or encyclopedia.com is also good.
03/08/17, 03:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: So you didn't mean physical?
03/08/17, 03:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Wow I deerped out
03/08/17, 03:30 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Derped*
03/08/17, 03:31 - Infected: I like physical encyclopedias because I like books but it's more economical to use online resources, unless you frequently visit a library.
03/08/17, 03:32 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And an entire collection of encyclopedias on your bookshelf is way more impressive than several hundred bookmarks in chrome
03/08/17, 03:33 - Infected: If you care about that sort of thing, yes. For added measure, you should have several dictionaries and thesaurus in different languages. It gets all the ladies riled.
03/08/17, 03:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And a massive globe
03/08/17, 03:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: With everything in a massive studdy/library hybrid
03/08/17, 03:35 - Infected: Don't forget vintage sea charts on the wall.
03/08/17, 03:35 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And little sailing ships in bottles
03/08/17, 03:36 - Infected: And some imitations of famous busts/ statues.
03/08/17, 03:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: YES
03/08/17, 03:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And more immitations of art
03/08/17, 03:36 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Like painting depiction the french revolution
03/08/17, 03:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Depicting*
03/08/17, 03:37 - Infected: Especially monet and impressionists. A few of DaVincis sketches.
03/08/17, 03:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Of course
03/08/17, 03:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And a fireplace
03/08/17, 03:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That always has a wood fire
03/08/17, 03:37 - Infected: It's cliche, obviously, but you'd need at least Van Goghs self portrait
03/08/17, 03:37 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeas
03/08/17, 03:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yes*
03/08/17, 03:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: His starry night is for the bedroom or dining room
03/08/17, 03:38 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's too soft for a study
03/08/17, 03:38 - Infected: With overly detailed pokers that have polished handles of some sort, either old wood or brushed metal.
03/08/17, 03:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I like that
03/08/17, 03:39 - Infected: I would prefer old wood, personally.
03/08/17, 03:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They should look victorian
03/08/17, 03:39 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: With brass inlays and everything
03/08/17, 03:40 - Infected: Tbh, we just described my perfect library.
03/08/17, 03:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yup
03/08/17, 03:40 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But we forgot the massive hardwood desk
03/08/17, 03:41 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: And the bronze lamp
03/08/17, 03:42 - Infected: With the oversized leather chair and vaguely nautical themed knickknacks.
03/08/17, 03:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Ooh
03/08/17, 03:42 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: A winged(?) leather chair?
03/08/17, 03:42 - Infected: If the room were large enough, I'd also have a sitting area with a very pretentious looking rug.
03/08/17, 03:43 - Infected: Yes.
03/08/17, 03:43 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 03:44 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: A leather winged high back chair
03/08/17, 03:45 - Infected: Two of them, and a matching love seat. With the appropriate end tables that match the desk. And lamps of varying sizes. With those woven baskets full of orbs that don't really have a purpose.
03/08/17, 03:45 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: YES
03/08/17, 03:46 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Tbh, the loveseat would just be for when I wanted to lie down
03/08/17, 03:46 - Infected: Obviously, same.
03/08/17, 03:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 03:47 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 03:47 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Haha
03/08/17, 03:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: This shifted from awesome study to pain too quicly
03/08/17, 03:48 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I may have whiplash
03/08/17, 03:49 - Infected: I don't understand why people feel bad about not having a significant other/ variety of friends.
03/08/17, 03:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Hmmm
03/08/17, 03:50 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It usually doesn't bother me
03/08/17, 03:51 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But when I have something to say, but no one to say it to, it kinda sucks
03/08/17, 03:51 - Infected: Understandable.
03/08/17, 03:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: This was ome very dynamic conversation
03/08/17, 03:53 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: One*
03/08/17, 03:55 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 03:57 - Infected: Likeable but needs a few alterations.
03/08/17, 03:57 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Yeah
03/08/17, 03:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The wood panneling is too light
03/08/17, 03:58 - Infected: I'd have done the staircase completely in wood and I'd have used different tables and accessories.
03/08/17, 03:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The chairs are too red
03/08/17, 03:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The look puffy
03/08/17, 03:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They*
03/08/17, 03:58 - Infected: It's too light and not enough of a cherry, imo
03/08/17, 03:58 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: They should look chocolate-y
03/08/17, 03:58 - Infected: Agree.
03/08/17, 03:59 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: With those button things to attache the leather to the back
03/08/17, 03:59 - Infected: The color scheme is backwards and not quite wise enough.
03/08/17, 04:00 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: It's more nouveau riche than wise
03/08/17, 04:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Actually
03/08/17, 04:02 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: That may be a bit exagerated
03/08/17, 04:03 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 04:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Way better
03/08/17, 04:04 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: But slightly too dark
03/08/17, 04:05 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: The wood and leather should be slightly brown
03/08/17, 04:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Or amber
03/08/17, 04:06 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Almost like cognac
03/08/17, 04:19 - Infected: Agreed
03/08/17, 04:26 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 04:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: Glorious
03/08/17, 04:34 - ‪+27 72 915 9203‬: I love the chandelier
03/08/17, 04:49 - Infected: Same. I think it's all a bit too red. It's closer though
03/08/17, 04:54 - Tahnacious: I know an INFP who always tested as an INFP until one day he was blind drunk and exclaimed "immmm gonna take that teeeest agaaaainnnhawhaw"
03/08/17, 04:54 - Tahnacious: He tried it and got ESTJ... Lol then he read the description and said "wow I'm a dickhead hahahah"
03/08/17, 04:54 - Tahnacious: I'm like no no no... You're just using your functions all wrong... Silly
03/08/17, 04:57 - Tahnacious: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 04:58 - Tahnacious: I have around 30 books in my set
03/08/17, 04:59 - Tel: Lol!
03/08/17, 04:59 - Tahnacious: Mine too
03/08/17, 05:00 - Tel: Woo! Hi! Where on earth is +852.. Googles..
03/08/17, 05:05 - Tel: 😁
03/08/17, 05:06 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:11 - Tel: The Qu'ran also re authority, from what I remember. I only read about half, though. It wasn't very nice about non-believers, either.
03/08/17, 05:20 - Tel: It's an indicator, not a test. 
The official version is fairly accurate - ppl change one dichotomy approx 30% of the time; much less for 2 dichotomies, etc. 
The indicator ideally is followed up by a 1:1 with an mbti practitioner who explores the dichotomies with you - before you get the result from the questionnaire.
03/08/17, 05:21 - Tahnacious: I take forever to come to a conclusion on anything anyway
03/08/17, 05:21 - Tel: Yup, I guess it's about being the least flawed at the moment. Psych is a sort science indeed.. Hard to be definitive when it's soft
03/08/17, 05:21 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:21 - Tahnacious: There's this though which discusses how what I previously mentioned may in fact be a thing
03/08/17, 05:22 - Tel: Lol, awesome answer
03/08/17, 05:23 - Amin: I cant get mbti point
03/08/17, 05:23 - Amin: I think it doesnt work for me
03/08/17, 05:23 - Amin: Tried hard
03/08/17, 05:23 - Tahnacious: So hard
03/08/17, 05:23 - Amin: But never get same results
03/08/17, 05:24 - Tahnacious: That's what Viagra is for
03/08/17, 05:24 - Amin: 😂😂 and harder
03/08/17, 05:24 - Amin: I think Im always on viagra
03/08/17, 05:24 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 05:24 - Tahnacious: I shouldn't encourage... Lmao
03/08/17, 05:24 - Tel: Lol you really shouldn't
03/08/17, 05:24 - Tel: Funny to observe though!
03/08/17, 05:24 - Amin: U are like my friends, I like to have u around
03/08/17, 05:25 - Tel: How do you mean it doesn't work for you?
03/08/17, 05:25 - Tahnacious: Awww 🙃
03/08/17, 05:25 - Amin: Encourage me to get hard?
03/08/17, 05:25 - Tel: 😂
03/08/17, 05:25 - Tahnacious: 😣
03/08/17, 05:25 - Amin: Viagra or mbti?
03/08/17, 05:26 - Amin: Ok please speak more accurate
03/08/17, 05:26 - Amin: Ok?
03/08/17, 05:26 - Tahnacious: Oh fuck... What did I start?
03/08/17, 05:26 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 05:26 - Amin: No seriouslyp
03/08/17, 05:26 - Tel: Interesting.
03/08/17, 05:27 - Amin: I have some intp specifications, some entj, some intj, some entp
03/08/17, 05:27 - Tel: Yup. We'll all blame you
03/08/17, 05:27 - Tel: MBTI
03/08/17, 05:27 - Tahnacious: I was drunk the other night... Did I seem almost ESFJ for a moment while blabbing about my cats?
03/08/17, 05:28 - Amin: @tel 👆👆👆
03/08/17, 05:28 - Amin: Im not a stable person though
03/08/17, 05:29 - Tahnacious: How old are you anyway?
03/08/17, 05:29 - Amin: 24
03/08/17, 05:29 - Amin: Rich af
03/08/17, 05:29 - Tahnacious: Well I guess you should be OK to type
03/08/17, 05:29 - Tel: Well, I can become quite deeply sentimental / melancholic when thinking about future prospects when drunk. Doesn't happen too often; guess it depends what's going on around me.
03/08/17, 05:29 - Tahnacious: I'm not even going to type what I was going to say
03/08/17, 05:30 - Tahnacious: Except possibly to Tel in PM because he would see the humour in it
03/08/17, 05:30 - Amin: The rich part helped to do whatever the fuck I wanted, so I think thats maybe a reason Im not stable
03/08/17, 05:30 - Tel: So yea, I guess you're right re ☝🏻
03/08/17, 05:30 - Tel: Lol. Do.
03/08/17, 05:30 - Amin: Girls
03/08/17, 05:30 - Amin: Focus on me
03/08/17, 05:30 - Amin: Ok?
03/08/17, 05:31 - Amin: There is a serious issue here
03/08/17, 05:31 - Amin: Stop being stupid and think about me
03/08/17, 05:31 - Tel: Hm. You will have diff bits from all types.. It's just you're preference is for one of them
03/08/17, 05:32 - Tel: I am a very good ENTJ when I need to be, but it's not my predecessor
03/08/17, 05:32 - Tel: Pref*
03/08/17, 05:32 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 05:33 - Amin: No
03/08/17, 05:33 - Amin: U r not helping
03/08/17, 05:33 - Amin: @15015198024  I find u more proper
03/08/17, 05:34 - Amin: How do u know u are an intp?
03/08/17, 05:34 - Tahnacious: How about I answer
03/08/17, 05:34 - Amin: Cool
03/08/17, 05:35 - Amin: My point is
03/08/17, 05:35 - Amin: Ok about first letter
03/08/17, 05:35 - Amin: There are some who are clearly introverted
03/08/17, 05:35 - Amin: And some who are clearly extroverted
03/08/17, 05:36 - Amin: But I am extroverted
03/08/17, 05:36 - Amin: Though inroverted
03/08/17, 05:36 - Amin: At the same time
03/08/17, 05:36 - Tahnacious: I have taken many tests from many websites, including cognitive function % tests and all have been conclusive in saying I was INTP. Also I went as far as facially typing myself and without anything but a few photos of my face they were able to type me as INTP, no words. Nothing. Of all 16 types, female intps being amongst the rarest... They chose that. Coincidence? I think not
03/08/17, 05:36 - Amin: Ok so
03/08/17, 05:36 - Amin: It worked for u
03/08/17, 05:37 - Amin: It didnt for me
03/08/17, 05:37 - Tahnacious: That is just your two dominant functions working. One is always introverted and one is always extroverted
03/08/17, 05:37 - Amin: My point is
03/08/17, 05:37 - Amin: I cant say if Im extroverted or introverted
03/08/17, 05:37 - Amin: I like to be estj
03/08/17, 05:37 - Amin: I hate being intuitive
03/08/17, 05:37 - Tahnacious: I always thought I was an extrovert as a kid because of my pronounced zaniness around people and my strong desire to fit in
03/08/17, 05:38 - Amin: But I am unfortunately
03/08/17, 05:38 - Tahnacious: I didn't take in to account that every second I was alone I was list in thought
03/08/17, 05:38 - Tahnacious: *lost
03/08/17, 05:38 - Amin: Ok so
03/08/17, 05:38 - Amin: I am entp
03/08/17, 05:38 - Amin: Lets say
03/08/17, 05:39 - Amin: But I want a brighter future
03/08/17, 05:39 - Amin: So I work hard
03/08/17, 05:39 - Amin: Does that make me entj
03/08/17, 05:39 - Amin: And there are times I cant stand parties and people
03/08/17, 05:39 - Amin: Does that make me intj
03/08/17, 05:39 - Tahnacious: I had a friend who is an entp, they didn't know that back then but they got typed at a later date. They were the first person to tell me actually you're not an extrovert, you're an introvert. You're what I would call an expressive introvert.
03/08/17, 05:40 - Tahnacious: This is without taking any mbti in to account because I didn't know about it then
03/08/17, 05:40 - Amin: Tahna
03/08/17, 05:40 - Tahnacious: Yeah yeah I know
03/08/17, 05:40 - Amin: Stop talking about ur self
03/08/17, 05:40 - Tahnacious: It doesn't confirm one way or another
03/08/17, 05:40 - Amin: Listen
03/08/17, 05:40 - Amin: Can u ?
03/08/17, 05:40 - Tahnacious: If you want a bright future but you sit around and do nothing about it chances are you're a P and not a J
03/08/17, 05:41 - Amin: I am doing alot
03/08/17, 05:41 - Tahnacious: Or an unhealthy J
03/08/17, 05:41 - Amin: I like this more
03/08/17, 05:41 - Amin: Go on
03/08/17, 05:41 - Tahnacious: All Js I know are busy busy people with strong work ethic
03/08/17, 05:41 - Amin: Whats an unhealthy J ?
03/08/17, 05:41 - Janith: Well I was just going to lurk and let you two figure it out but I can't help but notice you've made a mistake
03/08/17, 05:42 - Tahnacious: Someone with too much conflict going on in their functional stack
03/08/17, 05:42 - Amin: No I dont give a shit about ethics
03/08/17, 05:42 - Tahnacious: Poorly developed functions
03/08/17, 05:42 - Amin: Help us janith
03/08/17, 05:42 - Tahnacious: All that tells me is you don't use Fi 🤣
03/08/17, 05:42 - Amin: Whats fi?
03/08/17, 05:42 - Janith: Mbti is most effective when paired with Jungian cognitive functions. Don't consider the former without the latter
03/08/17, 05:42 - Amin: Test didnt help me
03/08/17, 05:42 - Tahnacious: All good, I'm on 24 hours with no sleep so I'm not doing my best right now
03/08/17, 05:43 - Amin: And I dont understand functions
03/08/17, 05:43 - Janith: Get some sleep. Discuss this tomorrow
03/08/17, 05:43 - Amin: There is another point janith
03/08/17, 05:43 - Tahnacious: But but :( I'm thinking and therefore can't sleep. Brain is burning
03/08/17, 05:43 - Amin: If I dont like the mbti results
03/08/17, 05:44 - Amin: Does that make mbti wrong?
03/08/17, 05:44 - Tahnacious: You might not understand functions but a lot more people here do than dont
03/08/17, 05:44 - Janith: Functions describe how you perceive the world
03/08/17, 05:44 - Janith: No
03/08/17, 05:44 - Amin: Can u help me please?
03/08/17, 05:44 - Tahnacious: There was an explanation between Ti and Te posted earlier. I'll post again
03/08/17, 05:44 - Amin: So what happens if u fight with being intp
03/08/17, 05:45 - Janith: I used to bang my head against a wall till my brain stopped thinking in situations like that 😂
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 05:45 - Janith: I will but later. I'm planning on heading outside and I gotta prepare myself psychologically xD
03/08/17, 05:45 - Amin: Btw, is there any way to stop being intuitive?
03/08/17, 05:45 - Tahnacious: To start with pick one of these two guys that you relate to more.
03/08/17, 05:46 - Amin: Cool 😂😂
03/08/17, 05:46 - Tahnacious: No, everyone has an intuitive function somewhere in their stack
03/08/17, 05:46 - Amin: Wait, thanks btw
03/08/17, 05:46 - Janith: You might be able to change your type. Though it requires a massive amount of work
03/08/17, 05:47 - Amin: Im working on it
03/08/17, 05:47 - Amin: Can we talk in private, I promise to behave
03/08/17, 05:47 - Janith: Also word of advice for anyone trying to play dragon ball xenoverse 2. Keep a spare mouse with you 😂
03/08/17, 05:47 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 05:48 - Janith: Which is why I'm forced to head out 😅
03/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: Sure
03/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: OK when you have figured out if you relate more to Te or Ti here is the next step to try and solidify the point
03/08/17, 06:07 - Arne: This is untrue. Let me say this: why would the computer do so? And it had probably back-ups
 So if we go the wrong way, it would just reset a part of us, and don't let us find out where we are living.
03/08/17, 06:14 - Tahnacious: Ok
03/08/17, 06:14 - Tahnacious: So after talking to amin for a bit
03/08/17, 06:15 - Tahnacious: I do actually believe he is ESTJ but in a Te/Ne loop
03/08/17, 06:15 - Tahnacious: I am have described the functions for that to him but what I said isn't making sense so can someone else assist?
03/08/17, 06:17 - Tahnacious: *I have
03/08/17, 06:18 - Amin: Whats this loop?
03/08/17, 06:18 - Amin: And how to get out of it?
03/08/17, 06:18 - Tahnacious: A loop is where you're kind of under stress and the primary function ignores the secondary function and goes straight for the tertiary function
03/08/17, 06:18 - Tahnacious: You get out of it by engaging your secondary
03/08/17, 06:19 - Tahnacious: So... Go through some old stuff, memories
03/08/17, 06:19 - Amin: Simpler honey
03/08/17, 06:19 - Amin: Simpler
03/08/17, 06:19 - Tahnacious: To help you would go through memories of your past
03/08/17, 06:19 - Tahnacious: Diaries
03/08/17, 06:19 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 06:19 - Tahnacious: Photos
03/08/17, 06:19 - Amin: Very hard thing to do
03/08/17, 06:19 - Tahnacious: Talk to old friends
03/08/17, 06:19 - Amin: They all say Ive changed alot
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: That's only if I have typed you correctly but honestly forcing myself out of a loop is hard too
03/08/17, 06:20 - Amin: I buried all my old friends
03/08/17, 06:20 - Amin: For have better ones
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: Yeah
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: Maybe talk with family
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: About shared memories
03/08/17, 06:20 - Amin: Family has no memory of me
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: Or go to a favourite place alone
03/08/17, 06:20 - Tahnacious: To ponder
03/08/17, 06:20 - Amin: Ive always been silent to them
03/08/17, 06:21 - Amin: In my childhood
03/08/17, 06:21 - Circle: Hmm
03/08/17, 06:21 - Amin: I liked to know every thing
03/08/17, 06:21 - Amin: I remember that I wanted to be God of knowlege
03/08/17, 06:22 - Tahnacious: But not just for knowledge's sake
03/08/17, 06:22 - Amin: I was a nerd af
03/08/17, 06:22 - Amin: No for using them
03/08/17, 06:22 - Tahnacious: I dunno, god of knowledge sounds more Ti lol
03/08/17, 06:22 - Tahnacious: But yeah to use knowledge in the world is Te
03/08/17, 06:22 - Amin: Kinda to for example a football team
03/08/17, 06:22 - Amin: This one is specific
03/08/17, 06:23 - Tahnacious: Were you ever good at sports?
03/08/17, 06:23 - Amin: I wished that I knew the best compisition before hand
03/08/17, 06:23 - Amin: Never
03/08/17, 06:23 - Amin: Best in chess though
03/08/17, 06:23 - Amin: I won my father when I was 7
03/08/17, 06:23 - Tahnacious: That makes Si an even stronger possibility
03/08/17, 06:24 - Tahnacious: Nice
03/08/17, 06:24 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 06:24 - Amin: So another example
03/08/17, 06:24 - Amin: I always wanted to have all the girls in the world
03/08/17, 06:24 - Tahnacious: also estjs are known to be notorious womanizers if I am not mistaken 🤣
03/08/17, 06:24 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: And when family pressuring me
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: I was so organized
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: But when I grow up
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: And became more free
03/08/17, 06:25 - Tahnacious: Yeah
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: I just went partying
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: And doing drugs
03/08/17, 06:25 - Amin: I was so curious
03/08/17, 06:25 - Tahnacious: Sounds so ESTJ to me lmao
03/08/17, 06:26 - Amin: Why the fuck do you laugh?
03/08/17, 06:26 - Tahnacious: Because estjs are kind of funny like that and I think it would suit you
03/08/17, 06:26 - Amin: So why do I feel so lazy
03/08/17, 06:27 - Amin: I hate to be lazy
03/08/17, 06:27 - Tahnacious: Probably because looping can make anyone feel lazy
03/08/17, 06:27 - Amin: How to get out of loop?
03/08/17, 06:27 - Tahnacious: For me a Ti Si loop involves me thinking too much about the past I lose all my humour and am unable to generate new ideas
03/08/17, 06:27 - Tahnacious: But for you I suspect you want Si
03/08/17, 06:28 - Tahnacious: Reconnect with some kind of memory
03/08/17, 06:28 - Tahnacious: Or something that makes you feel good
03/08/17, 06:28 - Tahnacious: Maybe a treat you had as a kid
03/08/17, 06:28 - Amin: I want to stop thinking about every thing
03/08/17, 06:28 - Tahnacious: Favourite movie
03/08/17, 06:28 - Amin: And have easier life
03/08/17, 06:28 - Tahnacious: Anything that kind of reconnects with your memories
03/08/17, 06:29 - Amin: But I want fame
03/08/17, 06:29 - Amin: Alot
03/08/17, 06:29 - Amin: And be the best
03/08/17, 06:29 - Circle: @61477394075 is this loop the cause of depression or am i getting the wrong idea ?
03/08/17, 06:29 - Tahnacious: Usually, yes
03/08/17, 06:29 - Tel: What's the motivation behind wanting fame, though?
03/08/17, 06:29 - Amin: To dominate others
03/08/17, 06:29 - Tel: Why?
03/08/17, 06:29 - Tahnacious: Intp depression tends to look similar because of Ti and Si just dwelling on the past
03/08/17, 06:29 - Amin: I like to be kind of a God to others
03/08/17, 06:30 - Tel: Why?
03/08/17, 06:30 - Amin: Dont know, makes me happy
03/08/17, 06:30 - Tahnacious: Because Te loves to dominate
03/08/17, 06:30 - Tel: Hm, no motivation other than just dominate?
03/08/17, 06:30 - Amin: No
03/08/17, 06:30 - Janith: That would explain a lot 😆
03/08/17, 06:30 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 06:30 - Tel: ?
03/08/17, 06:30 - Circle: @989306939802  you should focus your energy on bdsm
03/08/17, 06:30 - Tahnacious: Yeah I took some time and talked it through with pictures
03/08/17, 06:31 - Amin: Whats that?
03/08/17, 06:31 - Amin: And Im so hasty
03/08/17, 06:31 - Amin: But in my mind
03/08/17, 06:31 - Amin: In reality I hesitate
03/08/17, 06:31 - Tahnacious: He mentioned he doesn't believe in F bullshit so I'm like well that sounds like inferior Fi to me and you're making a value based on hating values 🤣
03/08/17, 06:32 - Circle: A chance for you to dominate 😉
03/08/17, 06:32 - Tel: (channeling Amin) took time with bdsm? Pictures?
03/08/17, 06:32 - Janith: Reseting an ongoing simulation to a previous state isn't as simple as you might think. For one thing it requires recording all aspects of the simulation from the point where you'd rewind onwards
03/08/17, 06:32 - Amin: But the point is
03/08/17, 06:32 - Amin: I dont find my self J
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: Cause J s make heroes of their parents
03/08/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: But also amin asked what was a weakness to expect and I said weak Fi is not knowing what you want or believe in. He essentially confirmed.
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: I dont
03/08/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: Js don't always
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: And S es pass on stuff
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: And dont analyze them
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: Though I do
03/08/17, 06:33 - Tahnacious: There isn't a neat box for every J, especially with tough upbringing
03/08/17, 06:33 - Amin: Estj s dont think 24/7
03/08/17, 06:34 - Tahnacious: Not always and remember I consider you to be possibly in a loop
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: They are more realistic
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: Though Im not
03/08/17, 06:34 - Tahnacious: Not always, they can become absorbed
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: I was like this
03/08/17, 06:34 - Tahnacious: A lot of the tropes are healthy and normal estjs
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: When I was a kid
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: I liked super powers
03/08/17, 06:34 - Tahnacious: It is entirely possible you're an ESTJ with added speedbumps
03/08/17, 06:34 - Amin: And unrealistic stuff
03/08/17, 06:35 - Tahnacious: That's right, Ne does that
03/08/17, 06:35 - Tahnacious: Ne is imaginative
03/08/17, 06:35 - Amin: I am imaginative af
03/08/17, 06:35 - Tahnacious: And Ne is the closest link to childhood
03/08/17, 06:35 - Tahnacious: If in tertiary position which estj is
03/08/17, 06:35 - Tahnacious: You could also be an intj I suppose...
03/08/17, 06:36 - Tahnacious: I dunno
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: Tahna
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: U r making it so simple
03/08/17, 06:36 - Tahnacious: Now yorue confusing me with all this haha
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: Though its not
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: The things u say
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: Doesnt fit with what I am
03/08/17, 06:36 - Tahnacious: I can't compute high Te and high Ne
03/08/17, 06:36 - Amin: Tahna
03/08/17, 06:37 - Arne: If the simulation can create us, why it can't do that? And you are right. It won't be that ez
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tahnacious: Except in an unhealthy cycle
03/08/17, 06:37 - Amin: Stop it
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tahnacious: Ok
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tel: The point of mbti is that you have a base framework upon which you place your personalised cover.
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tahnacious: I give up trying to help
03/08/17, 06:37 - Amin: Yeah
03/08/17, 06:37 - Amin: Exactly
03/08/17, 06:37 - Amin: U cant
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tel: You're going to be different to every INTP because of the cover.
03/08/17, 06:37 - Amin: And I dont find u helpful
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tel: Of INTJ or whatever
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tahnacious: Good
03/08/17, 06:37 - Tel: Or*
03/08/17, 06:38 - Amin: Thats how it goes with mbti
03/08/17, 06:38 - Amin: Makes me angry as hell
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tel: Perhaps because you need to bear it from an ESTJ / INTJ
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tel: Hear
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tel: :p
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tel: Different language
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tahnacious: I'm pretty sure he is estj but if he doesn't want to hear any of it it is not my problem
03/08/17, 06:38 - Circle: Haha
03/08/17, 06:38 - Amin: I know couple of estj s
03/08/17, 06:38 - Amin: Im not even close to them
03/08/17, 06:38 - Tahnacious: You asked. I answered, simples. Get as mad as you want.🙃
03/08/17, 06:39 - Amin: U only want believe that u are right girl
03/08/17, 06:39 - Amin: And u are so stubborn to even understand
03/08/17, 06:39 - Amin: How shaky I am
03/08/17, 06:39 - Amin: And u think u know me better than I know me by couple of questions
03/08/17, 06:39 - Tel: Challenge.. Do you want to believe that you're not able to be able?
03/08/17, 06:39 - Arne: Amin, when you doesn't want to believe it, doesn't mean it is bs
03/08/17, 06:40 - Tel: Able to be helped*
03/08/17, 06:40 - Tahnacious: Nah, I kept saying ifs and maybes and I could be wrongs. that indicated I'm completely open to anything indicating otherwise.
03/08/17, 06:40 - Amin: Huh?
03/08/17, 06:40 - Tahnacious: That is the actual issue here and it is part of inferior Fi
03/08/17, 06:40 - Amin: Tahna
03/08/17, 06:40 - Tahnacious: At a guess
03/08/17, 06:40 - Tel: Do you want to believe that others cannot help you, or that you cannot be helped?
03/08/17, 06:40 - Amin: I believe that
03/08/17, 06:41 - Tel: Then you will never be helped
03/08/17, 06:41 - Amin: I cant understand what others say
03/08/17, 06:41 - Tel: Because you are already closed to the idea of help
03/08/17, 06:41 - Amin: I want to help my self
03/08/17, 06:41 - Tahnacious: Seconded.
03/08/17, 06:41 - Circle: You dont want to understand
03/08/17, 06:41 - Amin: I dont want to be judged
03/08/17, 06:41 - Amin: U dont want to listen
03/08/17, 06:41 - Tahnacious: No one thinks you're a bad person for it. We aren't exactly emotional people.
03/08/17, 06:41 - Tel: There's no judgement here. We're INTPs (and an infp(?), @6582280971)
03/08/17, 06:41 - Amin: Honey u cant understand me
03/08/17, 06:41 - Arne: You don't want to get in a framework, not made by yourself
03/08/17, 06:42 - Amin: Because u are too structured
03/08/17, 06:42 - Amin: And never experienced DID
03/08/17, 06:42 - Amin: Honey I had psychich
03/08/17, 06:42 - Amin: Alot better than u two stupid girls
03/08/17, 06:42 - Amin: She focused that I am an Intp
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: Which I find crappy
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: And wrong
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: At the same time
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: Like exactly the thing Im telling to you two
03/08/17, 06:43 - Tel: Amin, if you want help, then I think ppl here are actually quite open to it. @61477394075 just spent a lot of time doing just that.. 

Perhaps it wasn't how you wanted it, though. 

So how would you like your help?
03/08/17, 06:43 - Circle: He sounds like an entp to me arrogant af
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: Stop being in ur stupid structer of mind
03/08/17, 06:43 - Amin: And listen
03/08/17, 06:44 - Amin: Mbti lacks
03/08/17, 06:44 - Amin: In many things
03/08/17, 06:44 - Amin: There is no introvert and extrovert
03/08/17, 06:44 - Amin: There is no stability
03/08/17, 06:44 - Tahnacious: I spent most of it in PM actually, before deciding to bring it here to engage a wider audience/pov
03/08/17, 06:44 - Amin: 😂😂😂 from janith
03/08/17, 06:45 - Amin: Or infected
03/08/17, 06:45 - Arne: There is, something stability doesn't have to be 100% perfect to be stable
03/08/17, 06:45 - Amin: Which I find alot brighter than u two
03/08/17, 06:45 - Tahnacious: Also wouldn't surprise me xD
03/08/17, 06:45 - Tahnacious: I find these statements amusing, anyone else?
03/08/17, 06:45 - Amin: I think I am more of a entp
03/08/17, 06:45 - Amin: Now u talk
03/08/17, 06:46 - Amin: Hina u are in
03/08/17, 06:46 - Amin: Tahna u are out
03/08/17, 06:46 - Tel: Amin.. The convo was about you wanting / needing help. Now you're attacking mbti. 

That's either diversionary or indicative of a higher motive. 

Or something else?
03/08/17, 06:46 - Amin: Tel
03/08/17, 06:46 - Arne: Mee
03/08/17, 06:46 - Amin: U seem more reasonable
03/08/17, 06:47 - Amin: Tahna is too arrogant
03/08/17, 06:47 - Circle: He is entertaining himself guys
03/08/17, 06:47 - Amin: And stupid
03/08/17, 06:47 - Amin: Hina u are out too
03/08/17, 06:47 - Amin: Tel get in
03/08/17, 06:47 - Circle: Haha
03/08/17, 06:47 - Tel: Go for it Amin
03/08/17, 06:47 - Shaiju: Ha ha
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: I attack it because I put a lot of time on it, and it didnt help, till I said fuck mbti
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: The point is
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: When I know some thing is right
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: Im like exactly
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: Thats it
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: Thats helping me
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: Thats what I want
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: But mbti sucks
03/08/17, 06:48 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 06:48 - Circle: @989306939802  do you actually want help ? Or do you want to disapprove mbti ?
03/08/17, 06:49 - Amin: I want to understand some thing
03/08/17, 06:49 - Tel: Well, what do you want help with Amin?

03/08/17, 06:50 - Amin: It does
03/08/17, 06:50 - Amin: For example

03/08/17, 06:52 - Tel: Is it as superficial as that? 

Well, what is a psychologist other than a title? 

Are you saying I can't save someone's life just because I'm not a Dr? 

Or tell someone what name a star has because I'm not an astronomer?
03/08/17, 06:52 - Tel: Categorisation happen for everything. That's a non argument amin

03/08/17, 06:53 - Tel: Lol. I think it's a mutual thing Amin - communication goes 2 ways. You ask for clarity to you, but you need to give it back too
03/08/17, 06:53 - Tahnacious: You only assumed that. I use Ti therefore my analysis is internal and I just spat out your answer.
03/08/17, 06:53 - Tel: Be more specific with what you want
03/08/17, 06:53 - Tel: If you ask an open q like you did, you get an open answer
03/08/17, 06:54 - Amin: Have fun suckers 👋👋😂😂
03/08/17, 06:54 - Tel: I'd go with @61477394075 d say that dislike of open answer is Ne tertiary to Si.. As you're engaging in N but it's serving a higher order S
03/08/17, 06:55 - Circle: Tel leave him be hes not looking for answers hes just looking for attention
03/08/17, 06:55 - Tel: Or all of it is bs.. That's science :)

03/08/17, 06:58 - Tahnacious: Also equally valid lol
03/08/17, 06:59 - Tahnacious: I think he just got super offended because my analysis was getting a lil creepy and hit a note somewhere and inferior Fi went booooom
03/08/17, 06:59 - Tahnacious: But as I say it is all just guesswork :) I do not claim to be a master, I'm just equipping my knowledge and testing it
03/08/17, 07:00 - Circle: Probably. But that kid has other problems that he doesnt want to deal with because hes enjoying his loop

03/08/17, 07:06 - Amin: Aaaah, very good, Descartes helps, tell me to introduce u next philosopher when  u are done
03/08/17, 07:06 - Tahnacious: I'm not against it but it would feel like delving in to my subconscious, not something I would naturally push for.
03/08/17, 07:06 - Amin: But yeah Descartes does very well

03/08/17, 07:24 - Tahnacious: Because I don't need to, that's what you want me to do and obviously I'm not that stupid. You're trying to trigger an emotional response from me and it isn't working 🙃 you may resume, this part was more amusing.

03/08/17, 07:26 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 07:26 - Amin: Now take a look at this
03/08/17, 07:26 - Janith: It's not impossible but it would require massive computational power. We'd be assuming that whatever civilization has that kinda power exists. Basically if we're gonna make such far fetched assumptions then we might as well skip those steps and say God did it
03/08/17, 07:26 - Tahnacious: Trolling usually requires an emotional response. I am pretty sure that didn't happen here, hence why you are bad at it.

03/08/17, 07:31 - Tel: Hm, do you have any spices at home? If ya do, then you can make it.. though you'd need normal teabags
03/08/17, 07:31 - Circle: Dependd
03/08/17, 07:31 - Janith: I live right next to India and yet have never had chai😂
03/08/17, 07:31 - Circle: Depends *
03/08/17, 07:31 - Tahnacious: I wasn't 100% sure honestly I just tested the autocorrect. Stupid autocorrect. I always take English spellings if autocorrect doesn't interfere
03/08/17, 07:31 - Arne: Nah
03/08/17, 07:31 - Amin: Why not?
03/08/17, 07:31 - Amin: Why yes
03/08/17, 07:31 - Tel: No! This is one of the very few times where the Americans are putting letters into a word rather than taking them out (colour / color). Odd!
03/08/17, 07:32 - Janith: In my case it would depend a lot on circumstances
03/08/17, 07:32 - Tahnacious: I can empty my current ones! XD
03/08/17, 07:32 - Amin: Ok explain
03/08/17, 07:32 - Circle: Poor people in general ? Hard working poor people drug addicts or in what situation?
03/08/17, 07:32 - Arne: Not necessarily
03/08/17, 07:32 - Tahnacious: Also it is grEy in England and grAy in America
03/08/17, 07:32 - Janith: Wait... You mean chamomile is the American one??? 😱
03/08/17, 07:32 - Amin: In general
03/08/17, 07:32 - Tahnacious: #themoreyouknow
03/08/17, 07:33 - Tel: Yup! https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=chamomile+or+camomile&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-gbGB756GB756&oq=chamomile+or+camomile&aqs=chrome.0.0l3.4999j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
03/08/17, 07:33 - Janith: I thought one of those was just the last name of the guy in 50 shades and the other was the color
03/08/17, 07:33 - Tel: Weird right? You'd think the English version would be the pretentiously long one..
03/08/17, 07:34 - Tahnacious: Nope! Weird eh?
03/08/17, 07:34 - Tel: Nah, @61477394075 is right. Gray = USA
03/08/17, 07:34 - Janith: Wow... I wasn't aware Americans put letters in too 😅
03/08/17, 07:34 - Circle: Ok in general assuming im not extremly poor and it will have an overall benifet to society or me then yes
03/08/17, 07:34 - Janith: Definitely weird
03/08/17, 07:34 - Janith: Can we make Gruy somewhere too?
03/08/17, 07:34 - Tel: I haven't seen an American type in a while else I'd rib them for it.. feels a bit lacklustre and bad to do it without their responses to make it fun :)
03/08/17, 07:35 - Janith: Maybe get a vowel per region
03/08/17, 07:35 - Amin: What is this?
03/08/17, 07:35 - Tahnacious: It is very hard for me in Australia sometimes to know which one is which, due to us being in neither country, descendants of the English and yet exposed to lots of Americanisation.
03/08/17, 07:35 - Tel: Oo sounds clever. If Gruy was a real word for Grey.. what continent would it come from?
03/08/17, 07:35 - Circle: Ok in general assuming im not extremly poor and it will have an overall benifet to society or me then yes
03/08/17, 07:35 - Janith: You guys put your own vowel in!
03/08/17, 07:36 - Janith: Aussie English sounds fun!
03/08/17, 07:36 - Tahnacious: Uruguay?
03/08/17, 07:36 - Amin: Ok, u r walking down the street, some pretty shabby kid ask money from u, would u help?
03/08/17, 07:36 - Amin: Exactly
03/08/17, 07:37 - Amin: Think
03/08/17, 07:37 - Amin: Dont hesitate darling
03/08/17, 07:37 - Janith: 👆 charity is a numbers game for me too
03/08/17, 07:37 - Amin: Hesitate
03/08/17, 07:37 - Tahnacious: ...it does? 😳
03/08/17, 07:37 - Amin: *
03/08/17, 07:37 - Circle: If i had extra money that wasn't needed for anything then probably yes but mainly to makr myself feel better in that instance
03/08/17, 07:37 - Janith: Middle East?
03/08/17, 07:37 - Janith: Yaaa mate! 😂
03/08/17, 07:37 - Tel: As good an answer as any I guess.. tempted to just name another country beginning with U now though
03/08/17, 07:37 - Tahnacious: I don't donate to charity, I don't believe in it. 😅
03/08/17, 07:38 - Janith: Sorry 😂
03/08/17, 07:38 - Circle: Im not hesitating im just a slow typer
03/08/17, 07:38 - Tel: Hm - @61477394075 + @94754191589 .. what's the rationales?
03/08/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: Uganda
03/08/17, 07:38 - Tahnacious: All good 🙃
03/08/17, 07:38 - Amin: No hesitating good, the point is thinking well and answering well
03/08/17, 07:39 - Amin: Another question, are u an open person?
03/08/17, 07:39 - Amin: Or u prefer keeping it to ur self
03/08/17, 07:39 - Janith: If I'm not on a strict budget + I have some extra cash with me + I'm not in a big enough hurry to analyze the situation
03/08/17, 07:39 - Circle: Generally yes but not with everything
03/08/17, 07:39 - Amin: Answer for stranger and friends both
03/08/17, 07:40 - Janith: Uzbekistan
03/08/17, 07:40 - Circle: I do not trust people easily if that's what your asking
03/08/17, 07:40 - Tahnacious: Well I reckon that most of the charity money gets filtered through and hardly any actually goes to the cause. People do it to feel good about themselves and not to actually see the results. It is pretty much a marketing scheme from my POV
03/08/17, 07:40 - Tel: U.A.E.
03/08/17, 07:40 - Circle: I only have one friend . And i trust her
03/08/17, 07:41 - Amin: Not trust, for example, if u are happy, do u laugh out loud, or u think u should laugh in a proper way
03/08/17, 07:41 - Tahnacious: If one would like to help the community I suggest you get some tools and go out and make the change yourself. Go to Africa and build a hut, I dunno.
03/08/17, 07:41 - Janith: Totally true actually. I only do direct donations to charity if I donate
03/08/17, 07:42 - Tel: Lol. I meant rationales re Gruy for the different places.. was trying to make that into a game, though the charity comment was unfortunately placed between the latest entry and my request for rationales
03/08/17, 07:42 - Tel: nvm :)
03/08/17, 07:42 - Janith: I'm wondering how a solar powered desalination plant on the African coast near the Sahara would do
03/08/17, 07:42 - Tahnacious: I.e. if cancer research matters a lot to you then you'd better get crackalacking on that degree! It takes a while! 😉
03/08/17, 07:42 - Circle: Well yes in that case generaly i react how i see fit depending on the situatiom and what im wanting to achieve from ot
03/08/17, 07:42 - Tel: I'm the same re charitable funding though.
03/08/17, 07:43 - Janith: Gruy had U
Uruguay had U
03/08/17, 07:43 - Tahnacious: Quite well I expect. But I also think castration of all rapists would probably go a long way in third world countries
03/08/17, 07:43 - Janith: Burn them alive!
03/08/17, 07:43 - Amin: Hmmm, well, Another one, do u find ur self being highly energized by others, or people make drained from energy
03/08/17, 07:44 - Janith: Mostly because I really want to see white phosphorus on skin
03/08/17, 07:44 - Tahnacious: 🤣
03/08/17, 07:44 - Circle: Drained from peoples energy . When i was younger i was quite social but now i would prefer to be alone due to this drain on my energy
03/08/17, 07:44 - Janith: The penalty for rape worldwide shall be pouring white phosphorus on their dicks!
03/08/17, 07:45 - Amin: Are u successful at communicating with people?
03/08/17, 07:45 - Tahnacious: Ouch! Only problem is lots of places worldwide just don't look in to the case properly
03/08/17, 07:45 - Janith: I'm willing to bet rape statistics will drop ridiculously quickly
03/08/17, 07:45 - Tel: Hm, the problem isn't the punishment, though; it's the getting caught bit
03/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: I have heard in at least one of the middle eastern countries female get away with claiming "rape" over nothing, the man is prosecuted and can't defend himself.
03/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: There was a documentary on it with footage from hidden cameras
03/08/17, 07:46 - Circle: I dont know what your saying . Yes i am able to communicate with people ? Or do you mean getting my feelings across ? If so generally im ok
03/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: The man's attempt to prove the claims wrong
03/08/17, 07:46 - Janith: True... Tbh I don't really care all that much. As long as I get to see the effects of white phosphorus 😅
I'm a simple man with simple goals
03/08/17, 07:46 - Tahnacious: Lmao 🤣 perfect
03/08/17, 07:46 - Tel: lolol
03/08/17, 07:47 - Amin: When some thing happens, do u pass over easily, or u over think about it?
03/08/17, 07:48 - Circle: I think about absolutely everything but i guess if i really wanted i could ignore things.  I judge myself just as badly as i judge others
03/08/17, 07:49 - Amin: Hmmm, do u always have problem in being decisive?
03/08/17, 07:50 - Janith: Classic INTP trait 😂
03/08/17, 07:50 - Circle: I do
03/08/17, 07:50 - Amin: Like there is another side to everythig

03/08/17, 07:54 - Circle: I dont know

03/08/17, 07:54 - Amin: 😂😂😂

03/08/17, 07:54 - Circle: LOL

03/08/17, 07:55 - Amin: Thinking they found an ultimate answer
03/08/17, 07:55 - Amin: Complicated thinkers always soubt
03/08/17, 07:55 - Amin: Doubt*
03/08/17, 07:57 - Circle: Ok i guess my doubt makes me a slow thinker , what function is that ?
03/08/17, 07:57 - Amin: Ti Te
03/08/17, 07:58 - Circle: Ahah
03/08/17, 07:58 - Amin: Are you highly energized?

03/08/17, 08:02 - Amin: Do u like debating ur ideas?

03/08/17, 08:02 - Amin: U making it hard
03/08/17, 08:02 - Circle: Sometimes i just use people as a sounding board and argue the opposite side
03/08/17, 08:02 - Tel: Haven't seen this before, but it seems v interesting!
03/08/17, 08:02 - Amin: Do u like talking about possibilities?

03/08/17, 08:04 - Circle: Yes because ive already finished the topic in my head no longer require assistance from whom i was speaking to
03/08/17, 08:04 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 08:04 - Tahnacious: It can be fun to witness it in action 🙃
03/08/17, 08:04 - Tel: Does it not logically follow that it is easier to be of higher competence if you're an I*** rather than E***? Or, perhaps, it's simply about how well developed your primary introverted function is..
03/08/17, 08:05 - Amin: Do the things u say contradict alot?
03/08/17, 08:05 - Circle: I didnt think so it . It may appear that way
03/08/17, 08:05 - Amin: Ok focus on this one
03/08/17, 08:05 - Amin: Its important
03/08/17, 08:06 - Amin: Do u suggest people for unconventional approaches?

03/08/17, 08:06 - Amin: See

03/08/17, 08:08 - Amin: Love?
03/08/17, 08:08 - Amin: Faster
03/08/17, 08:09 - Circle: No in all my experiences with this kind of thing i have always forced the person to talk about it and analyze her own behaviour and what she wanted out of this relationship and how she caused this to happen . The end goal will be sell realisation she will find what she wants to achieve herself
03/08/17, 08:09 - Amin: Hmmmm
03/08/17, 08:09 - Amin: Got u
03/08/17, 08:09 - Amin: Ok

03/08/17, 08:16 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 08:16 - Amin: Ok
03/08/17, 08:16 - Circle: People are inclined to deny it even if its the truth
03/08/17, 08:17 - Circle: So its better if they end up saying it themselves
03/08/17, 08:17 - Amin: I wonder
03/08/17, 08:17 - Circle: Just need a bit of manipulation i guess
03/08/17, 08:17 - Circle: But not in bad faith
03/08/17, 08:17 - Amin: Do u constantly scan ur surrounding?

03/08/17, 08:27 - Tel: You could hate it as it it interferes with your inability to sit in the background and think.. inability to externalise decisions.. or you could hate it because you made the plan, told everyone what to do, and you need to fulfil the plan dammit!
03/08/17, 08:27 - Tel: Type thing
03/08/17, 08:27 - Amin: Hmmm

03/08/17, 08:27 - Tel: Amin - I certainly agree. I don't deserve your guidance.
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: Do u solve problems very easy and effective ?
03/08/17, 08:28 - Circle: I dont like going out i spend days indoora
03/08/17, 08:28 - Circle: I would like to think i do
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂 bravo
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: Hina
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: Focus
03/08/17, 08:28 - Tel: ;)
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: Read the question well
03/08/17, 08:28 - Amin: I come to u with a problem
03/08/17, 08:29 - Amin: Do i solve my problem in a fast and efficient way?
03/08/17, 08:29 - Circle: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 08:29 - Circle: I think i do
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: Ok
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: Right now we know u are Ni
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: But it takes alot more time
03/08/17, 08:30 - Circle: Yes
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: Do u want to continue later?
03/08/17, 08:30 - Circle: Yes please
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: Sure
03/08/17, 08:30 - Amin: 1 last q
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: Do find my way more accurate or ur friend's
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: ?
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: And if u find mine
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: I spent triple more time on me
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: Than im spending on you
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: And im telling u
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: Mbti is a pure crap
03/08/17, 08:31 - Amin: Bue for now👋👋👋
03/08/17, 08:37 - Tahnacious: I hate it for the former reason. It is really awkward at my work when I'm sitting behind the counter and accidentally get peeved when a customer comes up. 

Oh wait that's what I'm here for, not to Google random tangents. Oops.
03/08/17, 08:38 - Tahnacious: Very pretty :)
03/08/17, 08:38 - Tahnacious: As a gift or for work?
03/08/17, 08:38 - Tel: Lol. Yea.. one of my more selfish jobs was as a cashier in a betting shop. I basically read the day away.. it was frustrating having to put it down / pick it up when customers came up.

I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't realise that I was being robbed at gunpoint for about 30 seconds once despite looking up and engaging the 'robber' in dialogue. True story
03/08/17, 08:39 - Tel: It was my first time though, tbh; didn't quite compute what was going on.. I hear that's common.. :p
03/08/17, 08:40 - Tahnacious: Putting a book down at work is one of my pet peeves 😣
03/08/17, 08:40 - Tahnacious: How the heck did you get out of that situation?
03/08/17, 08:42 - Tahnacious: I can kind of imagine that honestly haha, I have never had that happen but I think it would take a while for panic to set in if it even did.
03/08/17, 08:42 - Circle: @989306939802 i wasnt paying attentiom to her with you to be honest and she hasnt done it to me yet .
03/08/17, 08:42 - Circle: @61477394075 awe thanks hun no just at home
03/08/17, 08:42 - Amin: Read the process Ive went through with hina, never do that photo thing again, if the one u are testing is not informed enough, u may cause damage
03/08/17, 08:43 - Amin: Dont side without knowledge, its not a smart thing to do
03/08/17, 08:43 - Tahnacious: Such a lovely hobby :)
03/08/17, 08:44 - Tel: Didn't panic at all, oddly. The dude kept telling me to give him the £; I gave it (well, what we had out front..).

He then kept telling me to open the door to the staff area. I then immediately reflected on 'The Negotiator' (great film) and knew that I both a) wasn't allowed to open the door, and b) wasn't allowed to say 'no' (remember the scene where Farley was told to stop saying no??)
03/08/17, 08:44 - Amin: And how I know tahnacious is an estj , its that she can hurt me
03/08/17, 08:44 - Amin: Estj s are my weak point
03/08/17, 08:44 - Circle: Not really husbands always getting me flowers so i have to do something with them to show my appreciation
03/08/17, 08:45 - Tahnacious: The INFP guy I often reference in my ramblings did flower bouqets for work so I guess I have a soft spot for such things.
03/08/17, 08:45 - Amin: Estj have soft spot for infp s
03/08/17, 08:45 - Amin: Honey, read more about functions
03/08/17, 08:45 - Amin: U'll see
03/08/17, 08:46 - Tahnacious: Yeah a bit of a catch 22, what was the aftermath?
03/08/17, 08:46 - Tel: So I just kept saying different things to put them off. They got through the door anyway (crap security by my employers..!) and made me get on my knees. I tried my tactic again, but less success + he was closer with his gun. I complied.. a punter walked in the shop a few seconds after his 'colleague' said to just 'shoot them', fortunately ending that train of thought and I think inspiring them to run out of the shop
03/08/17, 08:47 - Tel: They took my colleague's phones and wallet (they missed my phone as it was in my book as a bookmark.. INTP saved the day through a) not being organised enough to have a bookmark and b) reading a book and needing a placemarker)
03/08/17, 08:47 - Amin: Tel
03/08/17, 08:47 - Amin: U are an entp
03/08/17, 08:47 - Tel: they got about £400. Not too much
03/08/17, 08:47 - Amin: U dont believe it
03/08/17, 08:47 - Tel: Totally.
03/08/17, 08:47 - Amin: Thanks for being realistic
03/08/17, 08:47 - Tahnacious: Lmao! Sorry this shouldn't be funny but it is.
03/08/17, 08:47 - Amin: I am not intp either
03/08/17, 08:47 - Tel: Yw
03/08/17, 08:48 - Tel: Oh no, it is hilarious. lol. V surreal for me post-fact
03/08/17, 08:48 - Amin: As @6582280971  truly diagnosed me
03/08/17, 08:48 - Amin: I am an entj
03/08/17, 08:48 - Tel: I even have a CD of it because my employer, 2 months after it occurred, decided to discipline me for 'secreting my phone and losing company assets'
03/08/17, 08:48 - Tel: lol. They didn't win that argument, shall we say..
03/08/17, 08:49 - Circle: Haha
03/08/17, 08:49 - Circle: Tel your hilarious
03/08/17, 08:49 - Amin: Fuck him then
03/08/17, 08:50 - Tahnacious: There was more stolen from my work but on a day I wasn't even there.
03/08/17, 08:50 - Amin: Ok my haters
03/08/17, 08:50 - Amin: 😅😂😂
03/08/17, 08:50 - Amin: Ima leave
03/08/17, 08:50 - Tel: Fortunate you weren't there really. Not the nicest thing to go through
03/08/17, 08:50 - Amin: I am feel alot better knowing that I proved my point
03/08/17, 08:51 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 08:51 - Tel: Odd thing is that I thought I was great at detail / memory. I knew what the guy looked like and could pick him out of a line up etc.
03/08/17, 08:51 - Tel: It was only when I saw the CCTV that I realised he was wearing a full face mask......
03/08/17, 08:51 - Tel: a balaclava*
03/08/17, 08:51 - Amin: I hate it when people stupidly stay on their wrong sayings
03/08/17, 08:51 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah, I can imagine. Part of me wants to be the hero but the other part knows I would suck so bad at it. Honestly I don't want any more black marks on my memory
03/08/17, 08:52 - Amin: Bye for now 👋
03/08/17, 08:52 - Tel: Cya. Have a good day.
03/08/17, 08:52 - Circle: Amin
03/08/17, 08:52 - Amin: Thanks man
03/08/17, 08:52 - Amin: Love?
03/08/17, 08:52 - Tel: haha yea. Ever imagine scenarios and how you'd react in them? I do that a fair amount..
03/08/17, 08:53 - Amin: Let me send u some link as long as u like mbti , its not precise, but its fun
03/08/17, 08:53 - Circle: Why are you the way you are? You are fascinating me
03/08/17, 08:53 - Tahnacious: I have close to photographic memory so I know what that part is like too
03/08/17, 08:53 - Tel: Go for it
03/08/17, 08:53 - Amin: I am suffering from me
03/08/17, 08:53 - Tahnacious: OK yeah, I imagine it a lot, would never go out of my way for it though 🤣
03/08/17, 08:54 - Amin: https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality
03/08/17, 08:54 - Amin: Tel, ENTP s are coolest species alive
03/08/17, 08:54 - Tel: Well, I think my understanding of my memory has evolved since then. I think I'm good at remembering the feel of the moment / general detail / more the meaning behind the memory, rather than the specific exact details. Make sense?
03/08/17, 08:54 - Tahnacious: Like these are all the endless things I would do if I won the lottery... Still not gonna do it 🤣 the likelihood of winning isn't even worth the investment
03/08/17, 08:54 - Amin: Se
03/08/17, 08:55 - Tel: We all have our opinions ;) All of them are as good and bad, in different ways, as each other
03/08/17, 08:55 - Tel: Yup! haha
03/08/17, 08:55 - Tahnacious: I remember stuff if I kind of actively take a photo of it in my mind... Don't get me started on audio though, tell me to remember exact wording and I'll have no chance even 30 seconds later
03/08/17, 08:56 - Amin: As I told u, I have 3 personalities, some times my personalities have different views, thats how i suffer
03/08/17, 08:56 - Amin: They love parties, they are good at talking, and they get along with most
03/08/17, 08:56 - Tel: Ah.. a conscious effort then? A learned ability?
03/08/17, 08:57 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'd say so, probably picked up from drawing a lot as a kid.
03/08/17, 08:58 - Tel: Interesting. I became tired of drawing very quickly as they were never as exactly precise as I wanted them to be.
03/08/17, 08:58 - Tahnacious: Then I have this conflicting trait with audio, I have perfect pitch but I can't for the life of me remember sequences.
03/08/17, 08:58 - Amin: Admit u are impressed by my confidence and u love the way I think
03/08/17, 08:58 - Tel: haha really?
03/08/17, 08:59 - Tahnacious: I have that issue to this day, honestly
03/08/17, 08:59 - Amin: Stop being stuborn tahna
03/08/17, 08:59 - Tel: Confidence is such an overrated thing.
03/08/17, 08:59 - Amin: U love me
03/08/17, 08:59 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 08:59 - Circle: Oh man i love hypothetical scenarios my friend hates thaf about me haha
03/08/17, 09:00 - Amin: Tell me more
03/08/17, 09:00 - Tel: How do you get past that mindblock?
03/08/17, 09:00 - Tahnacious: Actually I'm hoping that a brain interface is created soon where one can create artwork directly from their mind, as they see it rather than struggling with awkward hand movements.
03/08/17, 09:00 - Amin: Tahna Who left u?
03/08/17, 09:00 - Amin: Tell me
03/08/17, 09:00 - Amin: Who made u cry?
03/08/17, 09:00 - Circle: Im jack of all trades master of none because im too lazy to develop any one skill
03/08/17, 09:00 - Tahnacious: I don't really, for now I just draw and go "oh god the leg is off...fuck"
03/08/17, 09:00 - Tahnacious: Relatable
03/08/17, 09:01 - Tel: That'd be pretty cool. I want one to act as my library.. haha
03/08/17, 09:01 - Tahnacious: Ohhh man imagine writing books like that!!!
03/08/17, 09:01 - Tahnacious: $$$$
03/08/17, 09:01 - Amin: Tahna, u embarrassed ur self, its cool, just don't do it again
03/08/17, 09:01 - Amin: And lets be friends again
03/08/17, 09:02 - Circle: Why are you trying to provoke her
03/08/17, 09:02 - Tahnacious: If you agree to "behave" as you stated you would earlier I shall comply.
03/08/17, 09:02 - Tel: Well, I mean more as a repository of knowledge, though the ability to have m$ office in your head would be pretty funky too. Anything I came up with would be unintelligible, though - perhaps on par with the facebook bots when they talked to each other.. I can can I i can do
03/08/17, 09:02 - Tahnacious: Beats me 🙃
03/08/17, 09:02 - Tel: :D
03/08/17, 09:02 - Amin: She is pretty
03/08/17, 09:03 - Tahnacious: Doesn't work very well, I am not a person of anger.
03/08/17, 09:03 - Tel: Least he has good taste.. saving grace?
03/08/17, 09:03 - Amin: Hmmm, so gimme a kiss, I will behave
03/08/17, 09:03 - Tahnacious: You wanna go that far? 🤣
03/08/17, 09:03 - Circle: Haha aww thats better she is pretty
03/08/17, 09:03 - Tel: Good taste, defo; saving grace, still deciding.
03/08/17, 09:04 - Amin: Estj darling, goddamn cold
03/08/17, 09:04 - Tahnacious: It is just manipulation, or one of said 3 personalities. Haven't decided yet.
03/08/17, 09:04 - Tahnacious: 😉
03/08/17, 09:04 - Amin: Tahna, come on, u have tel, but u want me
03/08/17, 09:04 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 09:04 - Circle: I dony think its manipulation . I think hes lonely
03/08/17, 09:05 - Tel: Hm, those two statements are not mutually exclusive
03/08/17, 09:05 - Amin: Honey😅😅😅 u are wrong
03/08/17, 09:05 - Amin: Hina u know how u predicted
Me wrong first time
03/08/17, 09:05 - Circle: Amin again i swear im not joking i think you should focus your energy on bdsm start with 50 shades of grey😂
03/08/17, 09:05 - Amin: Just dont do it again
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: Hina, I am reach as hell, people here knows that
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: U new comers dont
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: So every thing u see in porn
03/08/17, 09:06 - Circle: I domt think i predicated u wrong in the first place i think you are an attention phene 😋
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: Ive done it in real
Life
03/08/17, 09:06 - Tahnacious: Honestly I prefer Tel because he is straight forward and that is a quality I appreciate. Plus he articulates himself in a more intelligent manner in my humble opinion.
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: This one is right
03/08/17, 09:06 - Amin: Finaly
03/08/17, 09:07 - Tahnacious: 👆🏻
03/08/17, 09:07 - Amin: Hmmm, but I intimidate u
03/08/17, 09:08 - Circle: And amin being rich has nothing to do with bdsm . Seriously gather some information its not about porn
03/08/17, 09:08 - Amin: And I got iq of 145
03/08/17, 09:08 - Tahnacious: You confuse me a little, I wouldn't go as far as intimidate.
03/08/17, 09:08 - Amin: So its very hard to control my self confidence
03/08/17, 09:08 - Tahnacious: Doesn't phase me in this instance.
03/08/17, 09:09 - Tel: Hm - you distrust MBTI, but trust IQ scores?
03/08/17, 09:09 - Tel: That's interesting in itself
03/08/17, 09:09 - Amin: Honey, I know what bdsm is, sumbissive sex
03/08/17, 09:09 - Tahnacious: That is OK, I have high self confidence over my intellect for the same reason, I just don't feel the need to attempt to belittle others for it.
03/08/17, 09:09 - Amin: No iq test ia bullshit too
03/08/17, 09:09 - Tel: Ah, least you're consistent
03/08/17, 09:09 - Circle: So why do you keep mentioning porn and your wealth i dont think anyone here cares how much money you got 😂
03/08/17, 09:09 - Tahnacious: Trufax
03/08/17, 09:09 - Amin: Im too much for u to process bae, I know, but u can learn alot from me
03/08/17, 09:10 - Amin: No I just like u, thats why I do what I do
03/08/17, 09:10 - Tahnacious: I believe there is the potential in something to be learned from everyone. I'm yet to find it in this scenario.
03/08/17, 09:10 - Tel: What is interesting, at least, is I quite strongly resonate with Amin's love of taking on multiple ppl in a 'devil's advocate' manner.. and switching viewpoints so easily just to do so
03/08/17, 09:10 - Tel: Quite an INTP trait I thought..
03/08/17, 09:10 - Amin: Uuuh, I think money is the main reason Im crazy
03/08/17, 09:11 - Amin: But some things are more important than others
03/08/17, 09:11 - Tel: I just don't get the purpose behind it
03/08/17, 09:11 - Circle: Yeah its got to your head . Middle easterns with money are notoriously annoying
03/08/17, 09:11 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 09:11 - Amin: I always win
03/08/17, 09:11 - Tel: Guess that's the trouble with INTPs; the Ti needs to be extroverted
03/08/17, 09:11 - Amin: Tel
03/08/17, 09:11 - Amin: U know why?
03/08/17, 09:12 - Amin: Exactly,
03/08/17, 09:12 - Tel: Because you're the only one playing?
03/08/17, 09:12 - Amin: No, because I dont buy bullshit
03/08/17, 09:12 - Tahnacious: Well yeah, honestly it depends on the subject matter. If it is interesting enough I will debate many angles. If it isn't what I want to be doing and my options are in binary then I'll just sloppily say "that will do, I guess"
03/08/17, 09:12 - Amin: Intp s does not know one issue
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: That they cant make others understand what they do properly
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: Me
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: I destroy u first
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: Thats how I help u see
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: Then I give u knowlege
03/08/17, 09:13 - Tel: Yup, I think you're on the money there
03/08/17, 09:13 - Amin: Thats how it works
03/08/17, 09:14 - Tahnacious: My ex was obnoxiously rich and also certified crazy.
03/08/17, 09:14 - Amin: Estj
03/08/17, 09:14 - Circle: LOL
03/08/17, 09:14 - Amin: Exactly, thats why u love me too, but Im nothing like ur ex
03/08/17, 09:14 - Tel: Sounds like an army officer? Destroy and rebuild recruits..

That way of doing things is so outdated though. There's plenty of research (much more concrete than MBTI) that proves this approach to be wrong and unlikely to achieve your aims
03/08/17, 09:15 - Tel: As you can see in this chat..
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: Nope
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: U are just saying crappy things
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: U read in some crappy sites
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: I talk firm
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: I choose trustable resources
03/08/17, 09:15 - Amin: And I talk strong
03/08/17, 09:15 - Tel: Yea, definitely haven't learned in academically 😉
03/08/17, 09:16 - Amin: And I dont blame u
03/08/17, 09:16 - Amin: Entps debate and debate and debate
03/08/17, 09:16 - Tel: Ty
03/08/17, 09:16 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 09:16 - Tahnacious: It is all just theory but theories are fun.
03/08/17, 09:16 - Circle: The real question is even if you disagree with someone why cant you explain yourself eloquently?
03/08/17, 09:16 - Amin: They are cute
03/08/17, 09:16 - Tahnacious: Yeah, ooops.
03/08/17, 09:17 - Amin: Choose what u believe wisely
03/08/17, 09:17 - Tahnacious: The problem is I never choose, I am in constant stasis.
03/08/17, 09:18 - Circle: Because new things can always come to light . Thats wisdom
03/08/17, 09:18 - Amin: Because people start to think that they are right not knowing shit, and they start to say their stupid stuff while they actually just read alittle, that makes me angry
03/08/17, 09:18 - Tel: Well, I was alluding to actual research tbh about different managerial practices.
03/08/17, 09:18 - Tahnacious: But I will agree that ENTP personalities are "cute". I know one, if it wasn't for physicalities I would've dated him.
03/08/17, 09:18 - Amin: Intelligence issue
03/08/17, 09:19 - Amin: Then u should love me
03/08/17, 09:19 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 09:19 - Amin: If physicality's are important
03/08/17, 09:19 - Tahnacious: I was more alluding to the part where you mentioned not having studied it yourself so the concepts read about may have alternatives
03/08/17, 09:20 - Circle: @989306939802 so everything you say is %100 right ?
03/08/17, 09:20 - Amin: Naaah
03/08/17, 09:20 - Amin: There is no right or wrong
03/08/17, 09:20 - Tahnacious: It isn't super important but this guy was physically unhealthy, missing teeth and 10 years my senior.

03/08/17, 09:21 - Amin: Btw Im bi sexual
03/08/17, 09:21 - Tahnacious: Actually he would probably be interested in that too
03/08/17, 09:22 - Tahnacious: So is he.
03/08/17, 09:22 - Amin: Estj s always do that, expressing so hard on the things they don't even know
03/08/17, 09:22 - Circle: What do you guys think about sexuality and transgenerism
03/08/17, 09:23 - Tahnacious: All I ever did was lazily brainstorm and I guess I triggered you somehow...
03/08/17, 09:23 - Amin: Just e few little medical stuff and u can change ur sexuality
03/08/17, 09:23 - Tahnacious: Doesn't really bother me what someone's gender or or how the present themselves. I generally just see a person .
03/08/17, 09:23 - Amin: Honey, the fact that u are an estj made me angry
03/08/17, 09:24 - Amin: My ex was an estj
03/08/17, 09:24 - Amin: I loved her
03/08/17, 09:24 - Tel: Amin - you presume far too much, bud. You don't know who has studied or experienced what in this group. 

This seems a little 'pot calling kettle black'
03/08/17, 09:24 - Amin: Seriously
03/08/17, 09:24 - Tahnacious: Lol
03/08/17, 09:24 - Amin: That never happens

03/08/17, 09:24 - Tahnacious: #feelsforreals
03/08/17, 09:24 - Amin: Though
03/08/17, 09:25 - Amin: I didnt love her then
03/08/17, 09:25 - Tahnacious: I get begging frequently, makes me feel like I'm a meanie.
03/08/17, 09:25 - Amin: So I didnt accept her
03/08/17, 09:25 - Circle: I think its very clear he likes you tahnacious
03/08/17, 09:25 - Tahnacious: For the love of god I don't know why...
03/08/17, 09:25 - Amin: Both wrong
03/08/17, 09:26 - Tel: Indeed. He likes me.
03/08/17, 09:26 - Amin: I just wanted to see if I can make her talk to me and not behave
03/08/17, 09:26 - Tel: Duh

03/08/17, 09:27 - Tahnacious: I think others will agree that I haven't said anything particularly untoward.
03/08/17, 09:28 - Tahnacious: Good for you...?

03/08/17, 09:29 - Circle: You want to break people amd its getting to you that its not working with her
03/08/17, 09:29 - Amin: Every one here does that
03/08/17, 09:29 - Tahnacious: I didn't for the most part but sometimes it is very hard to tell.
03/08/17, 09:29 - Tahnacious: Lol 🙃
03/08/17, 09:29 - Amin: Hina, u are a naive woman
03/08/17, 09:29 - Amin: So, I need to leave

03/08/17, 09:31 - Tahnacious: Me too but I find myself struggling to care.
03/08/17, 09:31 - Circle: I think we should give him a break i can tell hes very depressed
03/08/17, 09:31 - Circle: The poor kid
03/08/17, 09:35 - Tahnacious: Aren't we all?
03/08/17, 09:37 - Circle: Yes but hes the poor rich kid that deserves it
03/08/17, 09:38 - Tahnacious: Lmao #1stworlderlivingin3rdworldproblems
03/08/17, 09:40 - Tahnacious: My ex was so annoying, being a rich enfp meant that he took his need for Si to great lengths, kept on buying childish things like Lego and nerf guns. While this is cool at first glance it is definitely not worth dumping $1000s on.
03/08/17, 09:42 - Tel: Challenge: If you were going to convince someone that Amin was an INTP, what would you say? :)
03/08/17, 09:43 - Tahnacious: Hmmm

03/08/17, 09:43 - Tel: Using functions n whatnot.. perhaps an interesting thought experiment
03/08/17, 09:43 - Tahnacious: I would try and tell them his jumping quickly from ideas is Ne
03/08/17, 09:43 - Tahnacious: And keeping up with our conversations
03/08/17, 09:44 - Tahnacious: I originally thought that might be the case, but if he is correct in stating he is an entj then that would mean it is Ni and not Ne
03/08/17, 09:44 - Tahnacious: I don't understand Ni at all...
03/08/17, 09:45 - Tahnacious: Well I try to but I don't truly
03/08/17, 09:45 - Tel: Same, I struggle with it
03/08/17, 09:45 - Tahnacious: Something about grasping ideas from within rather than searching for external stimuli
03/08/17, 09:45 - Tahnacious: I wouldn't really be able to identify if someone was using one or the other only that I see that they're using N
03/08/17, 09:45 - Amin: 😂😂

03/08/17, 11:53 - Circle: When i saw*
03/08/17, 11:53 - Lulu: Lol
03/08/17, 11:55 - Didier: Will read this tomorrow!
03/08/17, 11:55 - Lulu: Tin frostings never do it for me and making my own good thick and sturdy frosting would take time for basic stuff, so I have just been using whipped topping as frosting
03/08/17, 11:55 - Lulu: Not as tooth achingly sweet and it stays together well
03/08/17, 11:55 - Lulu: And when in the freezer it gets hard and tastes kinda like an ice cream cake!
03/08/17, 11:55 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: They talk with each other or interact with each other like how do you know ?? (sorry if that bothers you)
03/08/17, 11:56 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 11:56 - Lulu: The most annoying part is waiting  for the cake to cool! I just want to get started on decorating!!!!
03/08/17, 11:57 - Tel: Wow, Ni and Ne making more sense now
03/08/17, 11:58 - Tel: Np. I suddenly feel bad for all the times my INFJ friend kept telling to slow down and let her finish a thought... Lol
03/08/17, 11:59 - Tel: Btw - I still don't get how you have the discipline to do this. I get bored after the 'I made the sponge' part and just chuck different flavoured cream fillings into it
03/08/17, 11:59 - Tel: Or on it
03/08/17, 11:59 - Tel: Massive kudos for the discipline
03/08/17, 11:59 - Lulu: ^^^^^^^^
03/08/17, 12:00 - Lulu: I love making sugar cookies because they are easy to make look pretty
03/08/17, 12:02 - Tel: Why not use string?
03/08/17, 12:03 - Lulu: I get more satisfaction from the knife
03/08/17, 12:03 - Lulu: It just feels smoother to me
03/08/17, 12:03 - Tel: Hm fair enough
03/08/17, 12:03 - Tel: Impressive attention to detail!
03/08/17, 12:04 - Tel: You'll have to supply recipes :D
03/08/17, 12:06 - Circle: Mmm sounds delicious lulu
03/08/17, 12:07 - Circle: Im assuming all intp can do sub par average levels of anything.  So tel im sure you could do it too its just where your priorities are
03/08/17, 12:09 - Shaiju: MAN GO?
03/08/17, 12:11 - Tel: Oh, yea, it's not inability, it's totally to do with it not being a priority. You're quite right with that

The opposing view, always, good to be well versed in. Not well founded though . I'd say the author doesn't understand what MBTI actually tests, what the results means, and he damages his creditably more so advertising a different test near the end of the article 😐
03/08/17, 12:12 - Tel: Yea, I saw that a while back. Old article right?
03/08/17, 12:13 - Lulu: Yes like the fruit
03/08/17, 12:14 - Amin: Exactly
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: Mbti is more corporate test
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: For example
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: I study deep
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: Go to the roots of a question
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: And I cant be fast and sloppy
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: Thats intp
03/08/17, 12:15 - Amin: And I respect mbti for that
03/08/17, 12:16 - Amin: And career helps it gives us
03/08/17, 12:16 - Amin: But personality?
03/08/17, 12:16 - Amin: No its sucks at showing who I am
03/08/17, 12:16 - Tel: Hm, interesting. In that sense, I can see your argument. Finally elucidated it
03/08/17, 12:17 - Amin: Sure, what did u think I mean
03/08/17, 12:17 - Circle: 😁
03/08/17, 12:17 - Amin: I always say, mbti is the best corporate test ever
03/08/17, 12:17 - Amin: But not personality test
03/08/17, 12:17 - Tel: Not a clue. All I heard was 'mbti rubbish'. Don't remember you saying much other than that
03/08/17, 12:17 - Amin: Rubish as a personality test
03/08/17, 12:18 - Tel: Fair enough. Sorry for misunderstanding
03/08/17, 12:18 - Amin: Like IQ tests
03/08/17, 12:18 - Amin: They only show ur reasoning
03/08/17, 12:18 - Amin: Nothing more
03/08/17, 12:18 - Amin: They are not smartness measures
03/08/17, 12:18 - Amin: Sry for being impolite as I am
03/08/17, 12:18 - Tel: Well, mbti is a part of personality, but doesn't take into account things that others do - like depression etc
03/08/17, 12:18 - Tel: So, in that sense, mbti is indeed rubbish
03/08/17, 12:19 - Tel: MBTI helps with the base, but big 5 helps with how / who you are right *now*
03/08/17, 12:19 - Tel: From my understanding
03/08/17, 12:19 - Tel: Nah, it's cool. You're just trying to out your point across. I get that.
03/08/17, 12:20 - Tel: We can all be impolite anyhow.
03/08/17, 12:20 - Tel: I prob have at some point; sorry for that!
03/08/17, 12:20 - Amin: I mostly believe mbti tells us how we interact with the real world
03/08/17, 12:20 - Amin: Not who we are
03/08/17, 12:20 - Tel: Hm, even though mbti is a constant you still don't think it's identifying a part of 'us'?
03/08/17, 12:21 - Amin: Its not constant for me
03/08/17, 12:21 - Amin: I dont generalise
03/08/17, 12:21 - Tel: Good point. Is it constant for each part of you?
03/08/17, 12:22 - Tel: Lol. Like what you did there ;)
03/08/17, 12:22 - Amin: For Amin yes
03/08/17, 12:22 - Amin: For monster yes
03/08/17, 12:22 - Amin: For kid
03/08/17, 12:22 - Amin: Yeah
03/08/17, 12:22 - Amin: Nice point tell
03/08/17, 12:23 - Tel: Not a point, was actually a genuine query.. Interesting that it's stable within each of you though
03/08/17, 12:23 - Amin: Aaaaah
03/08/17, 12:23 - Tel: So, has your view on mbti changed re personality re my q before?
03/08/17, 12:23 - Amin: Im not sure about kid
03/08/17, 12:23 - Tel: Hm k
03/08/17, 12:23 - Amin: But amin and monster sure as hell
03/08/17, 12:23 - Tel: How come not sure re kid?
03/08/17, 12:24 - Amin: Never took the test
03/08/17, 12:24 - Amin: Too busy playin around
03/08/17, 12:24 - Tel: Hm, are you able to analyse kid yourself?
03/08/17, 12:24 - Tel: Knowing what you know about mbti?
03/08/17, 12:24 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Right, I think it's what kind of information we take in (SN),  how we base our decisions (TF),  and where we process (EI). But I'd also argue that these are indeed indicators of who/how we are. Everyone is an individual, yeah, but everyone falls into a pattern or closely resembles a pattern, aka their type.
03/08/17, 12:24 - Amin: He is so tricky
03/08/17, 12:25 - Amin: Even seduces me
03/08/17, 12:25 - Amin: As his creator
03/08/17, 12:25 - Tel: Hm, can you think of any characters that kid is like maybe?
03/08/17, 12:26 - Tel: If can't analyse kid, then could analyse someone similar and see what the differences are
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: Very F
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: Indeed
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: But not always
03/08/17, 12:26 - Tel: Why very F?
03/08/17, 12:26 - Tel: And Fe or Fi?
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: He always feels stuff
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: Hm neither
03/08/17, 12:26 - Amin: I dont know
03/08/17, 12:27 - Tel: What does he feel?
03/08/17, 12:27 - ‪+1 (406) 381-6864‬: Are you practicing your Fe function rn? Is this what's happening?
03/08/17, 12:27 - Amin: Fun, mind gaming, stuff like that
03/08/17, 12:27 - Circle: Amin do you really have alter egos?
03/08/17, 12:27 - Amin: I am three
03/08/17, 12:27 - Amin: Yes
03/08/17, 12:27 - Amin: 1 is not enough for me
03/08/17, 12:27 - Tel: Mind gaming Amin? What's that?
03/08/17, 12:28 - Amin: I would have suicide as amin while ago
03/08/17, 12:28 - Tel: And what is 'fun' as a feeling?
03/08/17, 12:28 - Shaiju: So the MAN like the fruit and he should GO!
03/08/17, 12:28 - Amin: U know, playing mind games with others, stuff like that
03/08/17, 12:28 - Tel: I'm just attempting to help Amin explore.
03/08/17, 12:28 - Tel: Ah k
03/08/17, 12:29 - Amin: And parties for sure
03/08/17, 12:29 - Tel: What else can you analyse about kid?
03/08/17, 12:29 - Amin: He loves monster
03/08/17, 12:29 - Amin: Adores monster
03/08/17, 12:29 - Amin: Tells amin to shut up
03/08/17, 12:29 - Amin: 😂😂😂

03/08/17, 13:54 - Amin: Its wierd
03/08/17, 13:54 - Amin: Even the fact that they get horny is wierd
03/08/17, 13:55 - Amin: Aaaah, cool
03/08/17, 13:55 - Janith: They probably just picked something that looked vaguely like an opening and stuck whatever they had in there or something
03/08/17, 13:56 - Janith: This is actually a good point considering that most animals use pheromones and the odds of a dead male smelling like a female in heat is unlikely
03/08/17, 13:57 - Janith: But in all honesty I'm not interested in looking up the reason for why it happened
03/08/17, 13:57 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 13:58 - Amin: Hmmm

03/08/17, 14:25 - Amin: Awesome cars
03/08/17, 14:25 - Janith: "First, imagine a silent, cloaked figure walking home on a dirt path winding through the countryside. On some mornings he walks with his head down, apparently lost in thought. On others he walks slowly and stops to listen to the woods around him, a habit “which he practiced in the tropical forests of Brazil” during his service as a naturalist in the Royal Navy, collecting animals, studying the geography and geology of South America, and laying the foundations for a career that would reach its peak with the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859. Now, Charles Darwin is older and has turned from collecting to theorizing. Darwin’s ability to move silently reflects his own concentration and need for quiet. Indeed, his son Francis said, Darwin could move so stealthily he once came upon “a vixen playing with her cubs at only a few feet distance” and often greeted foxes coming home from their nocturnal hunts."

03/08/17, 14:28 - Amin: We all do dude
03/08/17, 14:28 - Janith: Two decades from his death no one will remember his name
03/08/17, 14:29 - Amin: No
03/08/17, 14:29 - Amin: He will be remembered actually
03/08/17, 14:29 - Amin: Like Michael Jackson
03/08/17, 14:29 - Janith: But truly great tend to be remembered
03/08/17, 14:29 - Janith: Micheal Jackson was different.
03/08/17, 14:30 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 14:30 - Janith: He caused some kind of change in pop culture or something
03/08/17, 14:30 - Amin: He fucked kids?
03/08/17, 14:30 - Janith: That too probably
03/08/17, 14:30 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 14:30 - Amin: Do u like to fuck 18 year olds janith?
03/08/17, 14:31 - Janith: All I know is, most people that are currently worshiped will be forgotten soon after their deaths
03/08/17, 14:31 - Infected: Because it seems the most likely type considering my personality.
03/08/17, 14:31 - Janith: I'm 19...
03/08/17, 14:31 - Amin: Can u mbti me? Please

03/08/17, 14:32 - Amin: How is that?
03/08/17, 14:33 - Infected: An uneducated guess. I haven't thoroughly studied your personality.
03/08/17, 14:33 - Amin: Dude, 😂😂😂😂 I am educated, so u r full of shit right?
03/08/17, 14:34 - Amin: Why are girls like this?
03/08/17, 14:34 - Amin: Mushroom shut up
03/08/17, 14:34 - Janith: I'd like to fuck someone I'm interested in enough to have debated the ethics of eugenics and AI, the possibility of interplanetary travel in the near future and the nature of human behavior with beforehand
03/08/17, 14:34 - Amin: Dont need ur help anymore
03/08/17, 14:34 - Infected: You asked me to "mbti" you while knowing that I don't have enough information to go on. Who is full of shit?
03/08/17, 14:35 - Amin: I mean ask me questions,
03/08/17, 14:35 - Janith: ESTJ currently has 2 votes then
03/08/17, 14:35 - Amin: Try to understand me
03/08/17, 14:35 - Amin: And stuff like that
03/08/17, 14:36 - Amin: Asshole 😂😂
03/08/17, 14:36 - Amin: Estj s are actually very capable
03/08/17, 14:36 - Janith: Hey @15015198024 did you know that Darwin worked less than 5 hours a day?
03/08/17, 14:36 - Amin: I cant even read that
03/08/17, 14:36 - Infected: I imagine he had his reasons.
03/08/17, 14:37 - Janith: After his morning walk and breakfast, Darwin was in his study by eight and worked a steady hour and a half. At nine thirty he would read the morning mail and write letters. Downe was far away enough from London to discourage casual visitors, yet close enough to allow the morning mail to reach correspondents and colleagues in the city in just a few hours. At ten thirty, Darwin returned to more serious work, sometimes moving to his aviary, greenhouse, or one of several other buildings where he conducted his experiments. By noon, he would declare, “I’ve done a good day’s work,” and set out on a long walk on the Sandwalk, a path he had laid out not long after buying Down House. (Part of the Sandwalk ran through land leased to Darwin by the Lubbock family.) When he returned after an hour or more, Darwin had lunch and answered more letters. At three he would retire for a nap; an hour later he would arise, take another walk around the Sandwalk, then return to his study until five thirty, when he would join his wife, Emma, and their family for dinner.
03/08/17, 14:37 - Amin: Janith can I hunt mushroom?
03/08/17, 14:37 - Janith: Don't deny that. Very useful human beings to have around
03/08/17, 14:37 - Infected: I understand enough about you. If I delved deeper, I would probably find you irritating.
03/08/17, 14:38 - Amin: Try
03/08/17, 14:38 - Janith: You forage for mushrooms I think. And huh?
03/08/17, 14:38 - Amin: 😂😂😂 can I hurt infected?
03/08/17, 14:38 - Infected: Sounds like a full day.
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: She will ignore me
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: She is not stupid
03/08/17, 14:39 - Janith: I honestly doubt you can
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: Yeah me too
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 14:39 - Janith: It sounds like a perfect day actually
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: The pretty girl earlier was a fun case
03/08/17, 14:39 - Amin: But I always try
03/08/17, 14:40 - Amin: Mushroom
03/08/17, 14:40 - Amin: Why are u so sad ?
03/08/17, 14:40 - Infected: I can offer you a preprogrammed mirror response, if it would make you "feel" better.
03/08/17, 14:40 - Amin: 😂😂😂 gimme a kiss
03/08/17, 14:40 - Janith: Also I remember that Marie Curie mostly spent her time either working or on long bike rides with Pierre
03/08/17, 14:40 - Infected: Tandem bikes, ftw.
03/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: Mushroom I think u are dead inside
03/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: Im actually making her happy I guess
03/08/17, 14:41 - Infected: I believe that is difficult to accomplish long distance.
03/08/17, 14:41 - Janith: Practically every girl in this group satisfies the criteria of "pretty girl" Amin. Be specific
03/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: Yeah, just gimme the emoji
03/08/17, 14:41 - Amin: Tahnacious
03/08/17, 14:42 - Infected: That is obvious and not entirely incorrect.
03/08/17, 14:42 - Amin: Yeah, mushroom do u get horny?
03/08/17, 14:42 - Infected: Not really.
03/08/17, 14:43 - Janith: Would you be willing to go on a killing spree sometime if you're not otherwise occupied?
03/08/17, 14:43 - Amin: How u manage that?
03/08/17, 14:43 - Janith: Asexual I'm guessing. Though that term is kinda dumb
03/08/17, 14:43 - Infected: Doubtful. I have responsibilities.
03/08/17, 14:43 - Amin: Hmmm, boring
03/08/17, 14:43 - Infected: Something like that.
03/08/17, 14:44 - Amin: Do u get excited?
03/08/17, 14:44 - Infected: I find it boring how your trolling is so basic. At least we see eye to eye.
03/08/17, 14:44 - Janith: No no not anytime soon. I have some stuff to do also. I mean after I get my shit out of the way and your son has grown up
03/08/17, 14:44 - Infected: Then possibly.
03/08/17, 14:44 - Amin: I find that boring to
03/08/17, 14:45 - Tel: Lol. Reflecting back on this comment..
03/08/17, 14:45 - Amin: I really like working
03/08/17, 14:45 - Tel: And how many times it has been broken since..
03/08/17, 14:45 - Janith: Awesome. It should be easier to find some weapons over there 😁
03/08/17, 14:45 - Amin: God if I could work 24/7
03/08/17, 14:45 - Amin: And my work is actually studing
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: Pure math and programming
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: Math analysis
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: Calculus
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: And finance
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: If I was not so lazy
03/08/17, 14:46 - Janith: Well there's a lot of teens here. And there's Amin
03/08/17, 14:46 - Infected: For the most part.
03/08/17, 14:46 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 14:46 - Janith: Preferred method of killing?
03/08/17, 14:47 - Amin: Infected
03/08/17, 14:47 - Amin: Have u ever been in love ?
03/08/17, 14:47 - Infected: That would depend on how many people you wanted to kill and to what purpose.
03/08/17, 14:48 - Amin: The real question is
03/08/17, 14:48 - Janith: Single killing
03/08/17, 14:48 - Infected: Romantically? No.
03/08/17, 14:48 - Amin: Ah God
03/08/17, 14:48 - Amin: Are you happy with the way u are?
03/08/17, 14:48 - Janith: Obviously as the numbers get higher it becomes less personal
03/08/17, 14:49 - Tel: 😂
03/08/17, 14:49 - Infected: I'm not interested in happiness.
03/08/17, 14:49 - Amin: So u are sad
03/08/17, 14:49 - Amin: Why dont u kill ur self?
03/08/17, 14:49 - Infected: Why would you want to kill for personal reasons? You're killing strangers.
03/08/17, 14:49 - Infected: Illogical
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: Bullshit, I find u fake
03/08/17, 14:50 - Janith: Wise
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: U just act
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: Who are u faking mushroom
03/08/17, 14:50 - Infected: Not being interested in happiness doesn't correlate to being sad automatically.
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: Ur father?
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: Infected
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: U are fake af
03/08/17, 14:50 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 14:51 - Infected: You don't have enough information to confirm that for a fact. You are trying to induce an emotional response to maintain superiority.
03/08/17, 14:52 - Tel: What does af mean?
03/08/17, 14:52 - Janith: I don't mean killing for personal reasons. I mean that killing completely random people isn't as fun for me
03/08/17, 14:52 - Amin: As fuck
03/08/17, 14:52 - Tel: Ah k
03/08/17, 14:52 - Tel: Ta
03/08/17, 14:52 - Amin: U are not real, I can prove that
03/08/17, 14:52 - Janith: But that's not what I want to know. What is your preferred method for killing a single person?
03/08/17, 14:52 - Tel: 'maintain'?
03/08/17, 14:52 - Amin: Why is killing ur self illogical?
03/08/17, 14:53 - Infected: I don't see killing people as particularly fun, anyway. It's more of a byproduct.
03/08/17, 14:53 - Infected: Perceived.
03/08/17, 14:53 - Tel: ;)
03/08/17, 14:53 - Janith: She's real. As real as I am
03/08/17, 14:53 - Amin: Janith dont help her
03/08/17, 14:53 - Infected: I have responsibilities.
03/08/17, 14:53 - Arne: What should you forgive?
03/08/17, 14:53 - Amin: U are real
03/08/17, 14:53 - Amin: She is not
03/08/17, 14:54 - Amin: What are they?
03/08/17, 14:54 - Tel: How on earth did we get to talking about killing ppl?
03/08/17, 14:54 - Tel: In the space of a few hours we've gone from incest to killing sprees..
03/08/17, 14:54 - Janith: True but I find it relaxing fit some reason.
03/08/17, 14:54 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 14:54 - Amin: Janith has psychological issues 😂😂
03/08/17, 14:54 - Infected: Taking care of people that can't take care of themselves.
03/08/17, 14:54 - Janith: Game of thrones was made like this dude
03/08/17, 14:54 - Tel: @94754191589 is this your fault?!
03/08/17, 14:54 - Amin: How?
03/08/17, 14:55 - Janith: Not the incest past!
03/08/17, 14:55 - Tel: Lol, yea, and I guess it is historical fiction.. But still! Haha
03/08/17, 14:55 - Infected: Various.
03/08/17, 14:55 - Janith: Killing people... Maybe 😇
03/08/17, 14:55 - Amin: Illuminate me

03/08/17, 14:56 - Infected: It bothers me when people describe game of thrones as historical fiction. It's not set on Earth.
03/08/17, 14:56 - Amin: Janith dont let liking her fool u
03/08/17, 14:56 - Amin: U know Im bold
03/08/17, 14:56 - Amin: But Im honest
03/08/17, 14:56 - Janith: I swear the only reason I'm not a serial killer right now is cause there's a lot of work involved in cleaning up
03/08/17, 14:56 - Amin: She is all act
03/08/17, 14:57 - Infected: I'm not interested in disproving your theory.
03/08/17, 14:57 - Amin: I can help u in that matter
03/08/17, 14:57 - Amin: Faaaaaaaaaaaaake

03/08/17, 14:57 - Infected: I'm not interested in mathematics, either.
03/08/17, 14:58 - Janith: I like her because she's quite precise and calculated in her responses
03/08/17, 14:58 - Amin: Wrong
03/08/17, 14:58 - Janith: I knew you'd be useful!
03/08/17, 14:58 - Amin: What are u interested in?
03/08/17, 14:58 - Amin: I like to be used
03/08/17, 14:58 - Infected: That's your perception of what I am. Personal opinions have nothing to do with me.
03/08/17, 14:59 - Amin: U are not original
03/08/17, 14:59 - Janith: You see?? How do you not like someone who's so beautifully surgical in their replies
03/08/17, 14:59 - Amin: U dont have a very thing u should have
03/08/17, 14:59 - Infected: I highly agree.
03/08/17, 14:59 - Amin: U are just a copy of others
03/08/17, 15:00 - Amin: Thats where I see if some one can do great thing or not
03/08/17, 15:00 - Infected: "Everyone is unique, just like everyone else."
03/08/17, 15:00 - Amin: No
03/08/17, 15:00 - Amin: Most people copy
03/08/17, 15:00 - Amin: And that copy ing make em ordinary
03/08/17, 15:00 - Amin: Original people though
03/08/17, 15:01 - Amin: They are the real ones
03/08/17, 15:01 - Amin: They make changes
03/08/17, 15:01 - Janith: Actually @989306939802 this can be true most of the time
03/08/17, 15:01 - Janith: Depends on how far into a person you want to go
03/08/17, 15:01 - Amin: Lets talk about acts
03/08/17, 15:01 - Amin: Not deep insides
03/08/17, 15:01 - Infected: Are you satisfied with your attempt to evoke an emotional response?
03/08/17, 15:01 - Janith: Of course the further outwards you go through more similarities you find
03/08/17, 15:02 - Amin: Nah
03/08/17, 15:02 - Amin: Exactly
03/08/17, 15:02 - Infected: You may continue.

03/08/17, 15:09 - Amin: But you
03/08/17, 15:09 - Amin: U have low self confidence
03/08/17, 15:10 - Amin: U dont even know why u do what u are doing

03/08/17, 15:10 - Amin: Be honest with ur self
03/08/17, 15:10 - Infected: I'm not afraid of your perception that I am fake. I'm sure many people would agree with you based on your superficial analysis. Your analysis, however, has nothing to do with me.
03/08/17, 15:10 - Amin: Things will get better
03/08/17, 15:11 - Infected: Believe me to be whatever you wish.
03/08/17, 15:11 - Amin: See u cant defend ur self

03/08/17, 15:11 - Infected: Agreed
03/08/17, 15:11 - Amin: The most expected response
03/08/17, 15:11 - Amin: From a big fat lie
03/08/17, 15:12 - Janith: Amin you realize you're providing quite a bit of evidence for you being an ESTJ right?
03/08/17, 15:12 - Amin: Janith no help

03/08/17, 15:13 - Amin: What are estj functions?
03/08/17, 15:13 - Amin: Im sure I have Ti
03/08/17, 15:13 - Infected: You hit on the point for me to continue this conversation. Amin is an interesting specimen to study at the moment.
03/08/17, 15:13 - Amin: Fi
03/08/17, 15:13 - Amin: Ne
03/08/17, 15:14 - Amin: But not very sure
03/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: Te Si Ne Fi
03/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: In that order I think
03/08/17, 15:14 - Amin: Seriously
03/08/17, 15:14 - Amin: I may be
03/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: Intj shadow type it would seem
03/08/17, 15:14 - Amin: Let me check
03/08/17, 15:14 - Infected: Which is why I like Amin.
03/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: Would make sense if you consider the monster subset of your personality to be intj
03/08/17, 15:15 - Amin: Nah
03/08/17, 15:15 - Amin: Si is wrong
03/08/17, 15:15 - Janith: Agreed. Curious. What do you do for a living? (sorry if I asked before)
03/08/17, 15:16 - Amin: 😂😂😂 😘
03/08/17, 15:16 - Infected: Nothing. I'm a drain on society.
03/08/17, 15:16 - Janith: You would make for an excellent scientist
03/08/17, 15:16 - Amin: Wait
03/08/17, 15:16 - Amin: Let me see intj
03/08/17, 15:16 - Infected: Perhaps
03/08/17, 15:17 - Janith: Then again... You're not interested in the procedure of it right?
03/08/17, 15:17 - Infected: Rules bother me.
03/08/17, 15:18 - Arne: If you call people who copy other people behavior fake, than all of us have a certain grade of being fake. And that certain grade is with a lot of people high. Like 80%? Dunno for sure anyway
03/08/17, 15:18 - Amin: No
03/08/17, 15:18 - Amin: Im no ni
03/08/17, 15:18 - Janith: I see. Mind if I run my ideas by you to get your input in the future? A second perspective is always valuable
03/08/17, 15:18 - Infected: Sure.
03/08/17, 15:18 - Amin: I think ne and ti are best for me
03/08/17, 15:19 - Amin: But ne and te works too
03/08/17, 15:19 - Amin: Wait
03/08/17, 15:19 - Amin: Let me check
03/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: And yet the behavior you're displaying seems to contradict that
03/08/17, 15:19 - Amin: How is that?
03/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: Are you being completely honest in your tests?
03/08/17, 15:19 - Amin: Af
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: I have issues understanding my self
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Fi
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Im sure about
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Ti
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Im sure
03/08/17, 15:20 - Infected: Fractured personalities can hold opposing views and believe both at the same time.
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Ne
03/08/17, 15:20 - Amin: Im sure
03/08/17, 15:20 - Arne: Amin, in which way you have these struggles?
03/08/17, 15:21 - Janith: In the conversation with infected you showed a lot of gross generalizations, hasty conclusions and assertions that lacked a solid logical foundation
03/08/17, 15:21 - Amin: Huh?
03/08/17, 15:21 - Amin: I am trying to make her angry, and Im actual trying stuff that works on her
03/08/17, 15:21 - Infected: I did ask him to defend his argument with facts.
03/08/17, 15:21 - Amin: It was actually working
03/08/17, 15:21 - Janith: True. I think we can establish "monster" as intj because he's the most productive one
03/08/17, 15:21 - Amin: Till u ruined it
03/08/17, 15:21 - Arne: Issues understanding yourself : which perspective
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: And distracted me
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: 😂😅😂
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: Ah janith u know how to fool me
03/08/17, 15:22 - Janith: Which one are we seeing now amin?
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: Me
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: Mohammad amin shirazian
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: Didier is healing me
03/08/17, 15:22 - Amin: I know how
03/08/17, 15:23 - Infected: Atm, I would say he's Amin. Monster has more aggressive behaviors.
03/08/17, 15:23 - Amin: But I talk to her
03/08/17, 15:23 - Amin: I get alot better
03/08/17, 15:23 - Amin: I dont know how
03/08/17, 15:23 - Janith: I also noticed Infected prodding you to observe your reaction. It's where I got the idea that she'd make a good experimenter
03/08/17, 15:24 - Infected: Accurate
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: I know, we were cheesing dude
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: U see
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: Ur problem is
03/08/17, 15:24 - Janith: @989306939802 which one is the personality you refer to as "kid"
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: U give ur attention to the way I talk
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: I talk slang
03/08/17, 15:24 - Amin: I prefer to be simple
03/08/17, 15:25 - Shaiju: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 15:25 - Infected: We both approach people as an experiment. It's one way in which we are similar.
03/08/17, 15:25 - Amin: Pretty, U r not an intp
03/08/17, 15:25 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:25 - Amin: Believe me
03/08/17, 15:25 - Amin: U are just hard words
03/08/17, 15:26 - Infected: I am. You're not.
03/08/17, 15:26 - Janith: Oh God the Fe. Good luck dealing with it man
03/08/17, 15:26 - Amin: And low IQ
03/08/17, 15:26 - Amin: No offence
03/08/17, 15:26 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂😂 now u talking
03/08/17, 15:26 - Janith: Very pure intp she is
03/08/17, 15:26 - Shaiju: Ha ha.. damn Fe... Terrible being...
03/08/17, 15:26 - Infected: No offense taken. I am aware of my tier.
03/08/17, 15:26 - Amin: Infected,
03/08/17, 15:26 - Arne: Why should we believe you
03/08/17, 15:27 - Amin: Lets get back to our conversation
03/08/17, 15:27 - Infected: Round 3. Continue.
03/08/17, 15:27 - Amin: Why are u using difficult vocab?
03/08/17, 15:27 - Amin: Does that give u self confidence?
03/08/17, 15:27 - Infected: I use the vocabulary that feels most natural in my current state of being.
03/08/17, 15:28 - Amin: Look who is in looooove 😍😍😅
03/08/17, 15:28 - Amin: And ur current state is?
03/08/17, 15:28 - Infected: Basic infatuation.
03/08/17, 15:28 - Infected: My neutral state.
03/08/17, 15:29 - Amin: Honey, u are running from some thing
03/08/17, 15:29 - Amin: Whats that?
03/08/17, 15:29 - Amin: Love
03/08/17, 15:29 - Amin: Uuuh
03/08/17, 15:30 - Amin: I forgot
03/08/17, 15:30 - Amin: Whats ur name
03/08/17, 15:30 - Infected: I'm answering your questions as you ask them. I can go more in depth if you prefer. I didn't see it as necessary.
03/08/17, 15:30 - Amin: Aaah
03/08/17, 15:30 - Amin: U are so goddamn fake
03/08/17, 15:30 - Amin: U lost a boy friend right?
03/08/17, 15:31 - Amin: Infected gomme ur name and I'll send a my nude photo right here in this group
03/08/17, 15:31 - Infected: I've divested myself of several over the years.
03/08/17, 15:31 - Amin: Why?
03/08/17, 15:31 - Infected: I have no interest in your nude photo. It's interesting that you think I would, though. Noted
03/08/17, 15:32 - Janith: I would argue it is neither. More like relived at meeting someone who functions in a way I can mostly go with
03/08/17, 15:32 - Infected: Not compatible
03/08/17, 15:32 - Amin: With what?
03/08/17, 15:32 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:32 - Infected: I wasn't compatible with them.
03/08/17, 15:32 - Amin: He embarrassed u mushroom
03/08/17, 15:32 - Amin: How, why?
03/08/17, 15:33 - Janith: I did? How?
03/08/17, 15:33 - Amin: Dude stop helping her
03/08/17, 15:33 - Infected: I could not give them what they were seeking.
03/08/17, 15:33 - FABIO: 2.400 msg
03/08/17, 15:33 - Amin: Ur flower? 😂😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:33 - Amin: Fabio my smart pal
03/08/17, 15:34 - Amin: Seriously
03/08/17, 15:34 - Amin: Fabio is one of the most smart people here
03/08/17, 15:34 - Janith: I'm not. I merely thought it would be unnecessary to to put the usual buffers I do when talking with people around infected
03/08/17, 15:34 - Infected: Various. Love, companionship, passion, a tool for manipulation. I'm not interested in the same things they were interested in.
03/08/17, 15:35 - Amin: Hmm, what is love?
03/08/17, 15:35 - FABIO: Baby dont hurt me...
03/08/17, 15:35 - Infected: Basically a few hormones .
03/08/17, 15:35 - Amin: Im a virgin 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:36 - Janith: Flower? Dude why are you making dicotyledon references now??
03/08/17, 15:36 - Amin: Hmm, some would say it is a choice, how do u find that?
03/08/17, 15:36 - Amin: 😂😂😂😂 just watch
03/08/17, 15:37 - Janith: Dopamine and serotonin mostly paired with evolutionary biased
03/08/17, 15:37 - Amin: Are u google ing girl?
03/08/17, 15:37 - Janith: *biases
03/08/17, 15:37 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:37 - Amin: Janith the lover boy
03/08/17, 15:37 - Infected: You have a choice in how you respond to what your body is telling you. Attraction & love are largely instinctual traits to ensure the continuation of the species.
03/08/17, 15:37 - Janith: I was googling dicotyledon cause I forgot how to spell it 😳
03/08/17, 15:38 - Amin: True or false me
03/08/17, 15:38 - Amin: Ass😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:38 - Infected: You didn't ask a true or false question.
03/08/17, 15:38 - Amin: Im asking now
03/08/17, 15:39 - Amin: Is this true or false?
03/08/17, 15:39 - Janith: I theorize that love exists because human children take a long time to mature. Keeping the parents together for that time would have been necessary as the female alone would not have been able to effectively care for a child and provide nourishment back then
03/08/17, 15:39 - Amin: Naaah
03/08/17, 15:40 - Amin: Its neurology
03/08/17, 15:40 - Infected: "Love is a choice, true or false."

True.
03/08/17, 15:40 - Amin: Googled it
03/08/17, 15:40 - Amin: So i know what happenes mushroom
03/08/17, 15:40 - Janith: I use dicot a little too much okay 😅
03/08/17, 15:40 - Amin: It goes like this
03/08/17, 15:40 - Janith: She releases spores?
03/08/17, 15:40 - Amin: We first decide to love
03/08/17, 15:41 - FABIO: Love. Is nota a choice
03/08/17, 15:41 - FABIO: Not
03/08/17, 15:41 - Amin: And give the data that we want to love some one to our brain
03/08/17, 15:41 - FABIO: Beeing together is
03/08/17, 15:41 - FABIO: But you can not choose who you love
03/08/17, 15:41 - Amin: Mostly learning from others
03/08/17, 15:41 - Amin: Then our brain start looking for some one compatible
03/08/17, 15:42 - Amin: With our choice
03/08/17, 15:42 - Janith: I'm willing to bet that everyone here has a definition of love that's different from the rest
03/08/17, 15:42 - Amin: So mushroom
03/08/17, 15:42 - Janith: That's how vague the thing called "love" is
03/08/17, 15:42 - Amin: U decided not to love
03/08/17, 15:42 - Amin: And ur brain aint looking for some one compatible
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: The very minute u start to giving the love data to ur mind
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: U gonna love
03/08/17, 15:43 - Infected: Redundant. I've already stated this.
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: No Im just stating a facr
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: Fact
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: So I guess
03/08/17, 15:43 - Amin: In ur family
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: Ur parents were not in love people
03/08/17, 15:44 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 15:44 - Janith: @15015198024 any thoughts on my theory?
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: Like romantic stuff
03/08/17, 15:44 - Lulu: This is Tracey
03/08/17, 15:44 - Lulu: Someone get my pun
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: Cause we mostly learn love from others
03/08/17, 15:44 - Lulu: Or play on words
03/08/17, 15:44 - Lulu: Whatever
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: We see people love each other
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: We get interested
03/08/17, 15:44 - Janith: Holy fu... I mean... Hello Tracy ☺
03/08/17, 15:44 - Amin: And we decide to have the same thing
03/08/17, 15:44 - Janith: Got it 😁😂
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: So mushroom
03/08/17, 15:45 - Infected: I agree.
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: Rough childhood
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: Right?
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: Huh
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: Mushroom avoids me
03/08/17, 15:45 - Amin: Sounds good
03/08/17, 15:46 - Infected: Not as rough as most.
03/08/17, 15:46 - Amin: Did shocking stuff happened in ur life
03/08/17, 15:46 - Amin: Did u live in a bad  neighbourhood?
03/08/17, 15:47 - FABIO: By your thinking... your parents didnt gave you attention amin
03/08/17, 15:47 - Infected: Obviously, or it's doubtful that I would have borderline.
03/08/17, 15:47 - Amin: My parents worship me
03/08/17, 15:47 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 15:47 - Infected: No
03/08/17, 15:47 - Janith: I'm thinking yes. Right @15015198024? 
You were there for 9/11, climate change really starting to speed up, the trump administration
03/08/17, 15:48 - Amin: Eeh
03/08/17, 15:48 - Amin: U are hiding stuff
03/08/17, 15:48 - Amin: U even hide ur name
03/08/17, 15:48 - Amin: Infected
03/08/17, 15:48 - Amin: I believe in me
03/08/17, 15:48 - Infected: Not quite. I was molested by one of my brothers friends, disharmony in interpersonal relationships, extremely isolated, etc.
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: I have a very powefull mind
03/08/17, 15:49 - Janith: A name is just an identifier. Infected works just as well as anything else
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: But as longs as u dont fight with me
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: I cant play with u
03/08/17, 15:49 - Infected: I use the name that I chose for myself.
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: So
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: Well done
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: U bored mw
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: And all the stuff I said
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: Nothing serious
03/08/17, 15:49 - Amin: Just words
03/08/17, 15:50 - Amin: I actually like u
03/08/17, 15:50 - Janith: Curious. I'm guessing you've deduced that those occurrences are the ones that are directly tied to your current state
03/08/17, 15:50 - Infected: I don't take you seriously. You often get bored when you're unable to prove your theory.
03/08/17, 15:50 - Amin: Kiss her ass
03/08/17, 15:51 - Janith: No thank you
03/08/17, 15:51 - Infected: Partly.
03/08/17, 15:51 - Amin: Naaah, I often get bored anyway
03/08/17, 15:51 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:51 - Amin: Ok seriously
03/08/17, 15:52 - Amin: U are way smarter than my last project
03/08/17, 15:52 - Janith: Have you tried to "fix" it?
03/08/17, 15:52 - Amin: Janith
03/08/17, 15:52 - Amin: She is kinda like u
03/08/17, 15:52 - Amin: I cant make her angry
03/08/17, 15:52 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:52 - Infected: There is nothing to fix.
03/08/17, 15:53 - Janith: Disharmony in interpersonal relationships and extreme isolation here too. Although my current condition is quite satisfactory I feel the ability to transition into a more socially conscious state would be useful in the future
03/08/17, 15:53 - Infected: It would depend on the day, actually. You generalized my behavior so much that you missed key information.
03/08/17, 15:53 - Janith: Told you 😜
03/08/17, 15:53 - Amin: Shut up
03/08/17, 15:53 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 15:54 - Amin: I still dont know why making others angry feels so good
03/08/17, 15:54 - Janith: The closer someone is to spock the closer they are to a pure intp
03/08/17, 15:54 - Amin: My problem is
03/08/17, 15:54 - Amin: My mind is intp
03/08/17, 15:54 - Amin: My behavior is not
03/08/17, 15:54 - Infected: My neutral state is very spock-like.
03/08/17, 15:55 - Amin: And u have no answer for that
03/08/17, 15:55 - Janith: Ask me that tomorrow. I might have an answer
03/08/17, 15:55 - FABIO: Your mind is a 16 year old. With sex issues
03/08/17, 15:55 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 15:55 - Tel: It is historical fiction.. It's based on a multitude of historical stories
03/08/17, 15:55 - FABIO: 😂😂
03/08/17, 15:55 - Lulu: Tracey got a little fucked up
03/08/17, 15:55 - Amin: Sex issues is right
03/08/17, 15:55 - Amin: 16 year old I don't know
03/08/17, 15:55 - Janith: @15015198024 I think Fabio just cracked the case 😮
03/08/17, 15:56 - Infected: I disagree with that assessment.
03/08/17, 15:56 - Amin: What makes u think Im 16 year old?
03/08/17, 15:56 - FABIO: All the attention.
03/08/17, 15:56 - Janith: I'll have whatever she's been smoking
03/08/17, 15:56 - Amin: Dude its not what it looks like
03/08/17, 15:56 - Amin: Its more that Im confused
03/08/17, 15:57 - Janith: Yeah I do too. More of a joke than anything else
03/08/17, 15:57 - Amin: Its hard to explain
03/08/17, 15:57 - Infected: Monster is a narcissistic sociopath, Amin is quite relaxed. They interchange fluidly.
03/08/17, 15:57 - Amin: Ass 😂😂
03/08/17, 15:57 - Lulu: K Tracey is real fucked up now
03/08/17, 15:57 - Lulu: Lol
03/08/17, 15:57 - Janith: You're right @989306939802. Getting on people's nerves can be fun 😂
03/08/17, 15:58 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 15:58 - Amin: Hmmm
03/08/17, 15:58 - Amin: Wait
03/08/17, 15:58 - Infected: More satisfying than fun.
03/08/17, 15:59 - Janith: Amin is quite pleasant. I'm thinking that if the right ideas were implanted in Amin then monster might carry them out
03/08/17, 15:59 - Amin: I feel lost

03/08/17, 16:00 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 16:00 - Shaiju: You need help... I am 'sensing' something bad event in the past. It could be unaddressed trauma.  Damn! Sorry it's just my wandering thought process!
03/08/17, 16:01 - Amin: No seriously
03/08/17, 16:01 - Shaiju: Now I sounded like tauret reader..
03/08/17, 16:01 - Janith: Worth a try I think. The monster subset would be quite efficient in the current social system
03/08/17, 16:01 - Infected: I've been planning this for days.
03/08/17, 16:01 - Amin: How do u guys dont feel lost?
03/08/17, 16:01 - Janith: It would be beneficial for both parties too. Amin could get money and we get a means to an end

03/08/17, 16:01 - Janith: Focus
03/08/17, 16:01 - Janith: I have an end goal

03/08/17, 16:02 - Amin: Defined

03/08/17, 16:03 - Amin: U all fool ur selves
03/08/17, 16:03 - Infected: The best way to study someone is to let them think they're arguing with you.
03/08/17, 16:03 - Janith: I made a promise to myself. I don't break promises
03/08/17, 16:03 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 16:04 - Amin: So how did ur study go?
03/08/17, 16:04 - Lulu: I hope no one minds my random shares of art during these convos
03/08/17, 16:04 - Janith: Good point. You're right there in the experiment so you can manipulate the variables yourself too
03/08/17, 16:04 - Shaiju: I haven't back tracked from my theory yet... It is just evolving... Does it indicate  trauma or just passing time?
03/08/17, 16:04 - Amin: Look at u 2

03/08/17, 16:11 - FABIO: Definetely. Not me
03/08/17, 16:11 - Infected: That's an interesting observation. Do you often think of conversation in terms of winner/ loser, owning someone?
03/08/17, 16:11 - Amin: Fabio I wonder, are u still with the infp?
03/08/17, 16:11 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>

03/08/17, 16:16 - Amin: Nothing, why? 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 16:16 - Infected: Sexual appetite as pertains to intelligence. I need to look into that.
03/08/17, 16:16 - FABIO: Are sou shure?
03/08/17, 16:16 - Infected: Yes.
03/08/17, 16:16 - FABIO: Are you having sex or dinner?

03/08/17, 16:16 - Amin: 😂😂
03/08/17, 16:17 - Infected: Sweet things tend to go better with the general taste of skin.

03/08/17, 16:17 - Amin: Lulu
03/08/17, 16:17 - Infected: It was sex.

03/08/17, 16:18 - Amin: Dumb
03/08/17, 16:19 - Infected: Inaccurate.
03/08/17, 16:19 - Amin: Do u like walking naked in the street?
03/08/17, 16:20 - Infected: Not particularly. It draws too much undesirable attention.
03/08/17, 16:20 - Amin: Do u like to be fucked in pub?
03/08/17, 16:20 - Amin: Oh
03/08/17, 16:20 - Amin: And family sex
03/08/17, 16:21 - Amin: Why no one is interested in family sex?
03/08/17, 16:21 - Infected: I've had sex in a variety of locations. The setting doesn't usually change the outcome.
03/08/17, 16:21 - Amin: No like every one watching
03/08/17, 16:21 - Infected: "Family sex" refers to what?
03/08/17, 16:21 - Amin: Fucking ur family members
03/08/17, 16:22 - Infected: Not particularly.
03/08/17, 16:22 - Amin: There is a porn chanel in youtube called family therapy
03/08/17, 16:22 - Amin: Take a look
03/08/17, 16:22 - Amin: Tell me if u like it
03/08/17, 16:22 - Infected: It doesn't generally change the end result.
03/08/17, 16:23 - Amin: Even knowing that other boys watching
03/08/17, 16:23 - Infected: Incest porn doesn't really hold my interest.
03/08/17, 16:23 - Amin: Do u like to be fucked by 2 boys?
03/08/17, 16:24 - Infected: I don't particularly enjoy sex at all. It's unnecessary.
03/08/17, 16:24 - Amin: Me neither
03/08/17, 16:24 - FABIO: Thats why the food
03/08/17, 16:24 - Amin: Sex is boring
03/08/17, 16:24 - FABIO: 😂😂
03/08/17, 16:24 - Amin: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 16:24 - FABIO: I picture you being fat. Infected.. sorry...
03/08/17, 16:25 - Lulu: I want to but it's not in my line of life TN lol
03/08/17, 16:25 - Lulu: Rn*
03/08/17, 16:25 - Infected: No, the details are for the enjoyment of the other party.
03/08/17, 16:25 - Amin: She is skinny
03/08/17, 16:25 - FABIO: That honey dick... is stuck in my mind
03/08/17, 16:25 - Infected: I am fat and unattractive.
03/08/17, 16:25 - Amin: Dont say that
03/08/17, 16:25 - Amin: U are pretty
03/08/17, 16:25 - Amin: And skinny
03/08/17, 16:26 - FABIO: Sorry to hear
03/08/17, 16:26 - Lulu: U just said u imagine her fat

03/08/17, 16:27 - Amin: How fat are u?
03/08/17, 16:27 - Lulu: How do I gauge such a thing
03/08/17, 16:27 - Janith: @447903370497 was right. We are unusually interested in talking about sex for a group of NTs
03/08/17, 16:27 - FABIO: Send nude
03/08/17, 16:27 - Infected: Political correctness isn't genuine, in my opinion. My weight is a state of physical being. The observation of my physical appearance isn't going to offend me.
03/08/17, 16:27 - Lulu: Because I don't really look like what I weigh lol
03/08/17, 16:27 - Lulu: Nah
03/08/17, 16:28 - Janith: I know I said I was gonna go but this group has an addictive quality to it
03/08/17, 16:28 - Lulu: Tru

03/08/17, 16:30 - Infected: Thank you.

03/08/17, 16:30 - FABIO: Fat is boring

03/08/17, 16:30 - Janith: What phone is that? I can't quite make the model
03/08/17, 16:31 - Infected: Physical attributes in general are boring.
03/08/17, 16:31 - Amin: U say it because u cant loose weight
03/08/17, 16:31 - Infected: Samsung Galaxy S5
03/08/17, 16:31 - Amin: 😅😂😅😅😅😅😅😂😂
03/08/17, 16:32 - Janith: @554691068741 @989306939802 come on. Even though very few here really gives a shit I still think we should avoid fat shaming on principle
03/08/17, 16:32 - Infected: I can. I have. It gets tedious. I don't have as much time to think when I'm preoccupied by other things.
03/08/17, 16:32 - Janith: It's quite unnecessary
03/08/17, 16:32 - Amin: Honey u are the definition of boring
03/08/17, 16:32 - FABIO: I dont find it healthy
03/08/17, 16:32 - Lulu: None of you are boring
03/08/17, 16:32 - FABIO: Will not aprove

03/08/17, 16:33 - Amin: So i are to week to get teen, I was fater than u, I solved that shit when I was 12
03/08/17, 16:33 - Infected: Approval isn't necessary to conversation.
03/08/17, 16:33 - Lulu: True
03/08/17, 16:33 - Amin: Me neither
03/08/17, 16:33 - Lulu: Not my point tho
03/08/17, 16:33 - Amin: No seriously
03/08/17, 16:34 - Janith: Oh now I get it 😂
03/08/17, 16:34 - Lulu: I never said I approve of unhealthy lifestyles I'm just saying
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Instead of talking all the time
03/08/17, 16:34 - Lulu: Lol
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Loose some weight mushroom
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Do
03/08/17, 16:34 - Infected: I have other things that concern me more.
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Do it
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Do it
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Stop talking
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: And start acting
03/08/17, 16:34 - Janith: I agree it's not really healthy but I doubt @15015198024 plans to live to see 100
03/08/17, 16:34 - FABIO: Yesterday..you said tomorrow
03/08/17, 16:34 - Amin: Make all those who called u fat
03/08/17, 16:34 - Infected: Perish the thought.
03/08/17, 16:35 - Amin: Beg for your pussy
03/08/17, 16:35 - FABIO: I do.gym
..and dont plan it
03/08/17, 16:35 - Janith: It's the same reason I don't really exercise much either
03/08/17, 16:35 - Lulu: Not everyone lives for the approval of others amin
03/08/17, 16:35 - FABIO: I choose 1 day as a lion. Than 100 as sheep
03/08/17, 16:35 - Amin: Buuuuuullllllllshit
03/08/17, 16:35 - Infected: I have no interest in such activities.
03/08/17, 16:35 - Amin: Hell yeah
03/08/17, 16:35 - Amin: Do it, if u didnt like me, kill me
03/08/17, 16:35 - Janith: I choose 25 more years as a wolf and then potassium chloride
03/08/17, 16:36 - Infected: I can't study you if you die.
03/08/17, 16:36 - Amin: U have gone into theory too deep

03/08/17, 16:37 - Amin: Can u change the fat weird girl?

03/08/17, 16:37 - Amin: Wise man talking 👆👆👆
03/08/17, 16:38 - Infected: I have no interest in getting laid. I have already procreated and have no intentions of finding a life partner.
03/08/17, 16:38 - Lulu: A job can't deny you for being somewhat overweight
03/08/17, 16:38 - Amin: Fabio
03/08/17, 16:38 - Janith: I've been curious about the mindset involved in being conscious about how others view you
03/08/17, 16:38 - Lulu: Are you dumb lol
03/08/17, 16:38 - Amin: Janith
03/08/17, 16:38 - Lulu: Any real job would look at serious credentials
03/08/17, 16:38 - FABIO: Yes it can
03/08/17, 16:38 - FABIO: And will
03/08/17, 16:38 - Amin: Actually I need some hibernation
03/08/17, 16:38 - Janith: Uh oh
03/08/17, 16:38 - Lulu: I've seen people bigger than her in good jobs lmao
03/08/17, 16:38 - Amin: Wasting too much time in this group
03/08/17, 16:39 - FABIO: Everyone looks at appearence
03/08/17, 16:39 - Amin: Its very addictive
03/08/17, 16:39 - FABIO: Its not that i care
03/08/17, 16:39 - Amin: Fuck that
03/08/17, 16:39 - Janith: Want me to bring you back in when you're ready @989306939802?
03/08/17, 16:39 - Lulu: Looking at appearance and considering it are two different things
03/08/17, 16:39 - FABIO: Its that is good... and helpfull
03/08/17, 16:39 - Lulu: What do you mean fuck that lol
03/08/17, 16:39 - Janith: Bullshit
03/08/17, 16:39 - Amin: Winners are like this
03/08/17, 16:39 - FABIO: I have the girl i like.... just becouse my boddy
03/08/17, 16:40 - Lulu: Well that sucks

03/08/17, 16:40 - Amin: Listen too me
03/08/17, 16:40 - Infected: Say something that will make me think. Noting how personal appearances effect the opinions of others isn't going to interest me.
03/08/17, 16:40 - Lulu: You know
03/08/17, 16:40 - Lulu: Looks fade guys
03/08/17, 16:40 - Amin: Listen to me
03/08/17, 16:40 - Janith: That is painful to the point where it registered a reaction with my Fe.
03/08/17, 16:41 - Amin: U are a  smart beautiful girl
03/08/17, 16:41 - Amin: I think u lack only 1 thing to be perfrct
03/08/17, 16:41 - Janith: Next.

03/08/17, 16:41 - Amin: And that is the way u look
03/08/17, 16:41 - Amin: Ok?
03/08/17, 16:41 - Infected: Reality is perception.
03/08/17, 16:41 - FABIO: I preffer she liking my boddy... than lieing To me
03/08/17, 16:41 - Amin: Just lose some weight

03/08/17, 16:42 - Amin: Make em beg
03/08/17, 16:42 - FABIO: Saying she dont bothers with appearence
03/08/17, 16:42 - Tel: I didn't say unusually interested in it! I simply said I found it funny how many times we had gone against @14843534493 's request in such a short amount of time
03/08/17, 16:42 - Amin: But dont let em touch u
03/08/17, 16:42 - Amin: It will feel good
03/08/17, 16:42 - Amin: I  Promise
03/08/17, 16:42 - FABIO: She is beautifuk
03/08/17, 16:42 - Lulu: If you make any life changes with intent of pleasing others you will become obsessed an seemingly with your personality it will leave you diminished as a person, if you are going to do something do it for yourself regardless
03/08/17, 16:42 - FABIO: If i am not too
03/08/17, 16:42 - FABIO: She will find. Something better
03/08/17, 16:42 - Janith: I understand that. I generally get motivated to keep my looks in check when I'm in a relationship too
03/08/17, 16:42 - Lulu: Perfect people aren't real
03/08/17, 16:42 - Amin: Janith u are betraying her
03/08/17, 16:42 - Infected: Agreed.
03/08/17, 16:42 - FABIO: Is that way... when you are not fat and ugly
03/08/17, 16:43 - Janith: But it doesn't mean that it matters dude
03/08/17, 16:43 - Amin: Buuuuuuuuuuuuuulllll shit
03/08/17, 16:43 - FABIO: Janith
03/08/17, 16:43 - Janith: Quite simply you're doing it for her
03/08/17, 16:43 - Amin: Do it mushroom
03/08/17, 16:43 - FABIO: We have.only.one life
03/08/17, 16:43 - FABIO: You will spend it
03/08/17, 16:43 - FABIO: With a fat ugly chick
03/08/17, 16:43 - Amin: Dont let bullshit take ur mind
03/08/17, 16:43 - Amin: Be great
03/08/17, 16:43 - FABIO: Or some good looking smart1 one?
03/08/17, 16:43 - Amin: Be glorious
03/08/17, 16:44 - FABIO: I take care of my mind. As well as my.boddy
03/08/17, 16:44 - Janith: The two show no correlation
03/08/17, 16:44 - Amin: Then think how u likw
03/08/17, 16:44 - FABIO: Both1 matters
03/08/17, 16:44 - Lulu: I don't think she is ugly
03/08/17, 16:44 - Infected: Why should I make alterations to my basic form to elicit unwanted affections from people I have no interest in?
03/08/17, 16:44 - Amin: Honest
03/08/17, 16:44 - FABIO: Yes they doo... health mind. Means healthy boddy
03/08/17, 16:44 - Janith: Actually... Maybe a slight negative correlation if the stereotypes are to be believed
03/08/17, 16:44 - Lulu: And there are certainly people I'm her life whom will find her attractive as she is
03/08/17, 16:44 - Amin: True
03/08/17, 16:44 - Lulu: Mind and body
03/08/17, 16:44 - FABIO: Lies
03/08/17, 16:45 - Amin: Do it, for christ sake, just do it
03/08/17, 16:45 - Lulu: Why do you think everyone feels the same as you lol
03/08/17, 16:45 - Janith: Honestly though @554691068741 I'm not interested in the body. My interest in a girl has been almost exclusively mental
03/08/17, 16:45 - Amin: Aaaaaah
03/08/17, 16:45 - Amin: Janith
03/08/17, 16:45 - Amin: Janith look at me
03/08/17, 16:45 - FABIO: Becouse

03/08/17, 16:45 - Amin: When I provoked u to do python
03/08/17, 16:45 - FABIO: Just becouse are too lazy
03/08/17, 16:45 - FABIO: To do gym
03/08/17, 16:46 - Amin: Was it bad?
03/08/17, 16:46 - Lulu: I'm lying to no one
03/08/17, 16:46 - Lulu: I think she is beautiful
03/08/17, 16:46 - FABIO: I was this way once too
03/08/17, 16:46 - Amin: True
03/08/17, 16:46 - Lulu: And others will too
03/08/17, 16:46 - Janith: I just play the horny teenager card sometimes to make them feel good about their appearance when they were feeling down
03/08/17, 16:46 - Amin: True
03/08/17, 16:46 - Infected: Observing this exchange is slightly interesting.
03/08/17, 16:46 - Janith: I can confidently say I'm not
03/08/17, 16:46 - Infected: However, it's also very basic.
03/08/17, 16:46 - Tel: It's confusing for me as I joined halfway through..
03/08/17, 16:47 - Lulu: Just because you are not completely able to think this doesn't mean someone else is not capable of the train of thought
03/08/17, 16:47 - Amin: Infected, instead of observing me, observe ur self, help ur self, no one else does
03/08/17, 16:47 - Amin: Love ur self
03/08/17, 16:47 - Amin: No one else do
03/08/17, 16:47 - Amin: Aaaah
03/08/17, 16:47 - Janith: Slightly annoying in the redundancy of this topic in society tbh
03/08/17, 16:47 - FABIO: I would never.love my self.. if i wasnt able to1 see my1 fucking dick1. Every1 time i pee
03/08/17, 16:47 - Amin: Thats what happens to me to hen
03/08/17, 16:47 - FABIO: My god
03/08/17, 16:47 - Infected: Amin and Fabio believe that I should put more care into my physical appearance to sway the opinions of other people in my favor.
03/08/17, 16:47 - FABIO: It1 is not okay
03/08/17, 16:47 - FABIO: Nor desirable
03/08/17, 16:47 - FABIO: Dont lid
03/08/17, 16:48 - FABIO: Lie
03/08/17, 16:48 - Amin: Ive learned in this very moment
03/08/17, 16:48 - Lulu: Do you really think people who are overweight aren't constantly reminded that they are? Lol
03/08/17, 16:48 - Amin: Mushroom thanks
03/08/17, 16:48 - FABIO: Yes
03/08/17, 16:48 - FABIO: Elseway they would loose wigth
03/08/17, 16:48 - FABIO: Weigth
03/08/17, 16:48 - Janith: Actually... You didn't provoke me. I wanted to get into machine learning. Needed python. Remembered your dare. Two birds with one stone
03/08/17, 16:48 - Amin: Naaah, its like just do it
03/08/17, 16:48 - Lulu: That's not it at all
03/08/17, 16:48 - Amin: Ok 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 16:49 - Amin: Anyway
03/08/17, 16:49 - Tel: I saw the bit where you said you didn't care for it. 

So I don't get why they're continuing..
03/08/17, 16:49 - FABIO: You care soo much for mjnd
03/08/17, 16:49 - Amin: Fuck theories
03/08/17, 16:49 - FABIO: Mind
03/08/17, 16:49 - Lulu: For a lot of people there is more to go into it than just doing it, for some it's not and they are just lazy or don't want to
03/08/17, 16:49 - FABIO: Why not boddy
03/08/17, 16:49 - FABIO: ?
03/08/17, 16:49 - Infected: Misconceptions and stereotyping is not relegated to feelers alone. Boring.
03/08/17, 16:49 - Amin: Im alot better without thinking
03/08/17, 16:49 - Lulu: Okay the main point is
03/08/17, 16:49 - Amin: Hell yea
03/08/17, 16:49 - Lulu: I'm just wondering
03/08/17, 16:49 - Lulu: Why do you care so much
03/08/17, 16:49 - Tel: Indeed
03/08/17, 16:49 - Lulu: Bout someone else body
03/08/17, 16:49 - FABIO: I just wanna help
03/08/17, 16:50 - Amin: Me too
03/08/17, 16:50 - Lulu: Yes but she doesn't care
03/08/17, 16:50 - Janith: Unknown. Maybe there's a problem with the neural circuitry in my brain. 
I plan on getting into an MRI to test the theory in the future
03/08/17, 16:50 - FABIO: 1 fucking life in this shit world.. and1 waste it being fat
03/08/17, 16:50 - Amin: Fabio I really approve u
03/08/17, 16:50 - Lulu: She is not even the one responding to the input
03/08/17, 16:50 - Amin: Ok
03/08/17, 16:50 - Amin: The point is
03/08/17, 16:50 - FABIO: No wonder
03/08/17, 16:50 - Amin: I care how people care about me
03/08/17, 16:50 - FABIO: Why you1 guys dont like to live
03/08/17, 16:50 - Infected: Observing is more interesting. I have nothing to add to redundancy.
03/08/17, 16:51 - Amin: I care how girls react when they see me
03/08/17, 16:51 - Janith: I'm not fat. Struggling to remain within healthy BMI actually 😂
03/08/17, 16:51 - Amin: I care about being superior
03/08/17, 16:51 - Amin: I care about dominance

03/08/17, 16:51 - Infected: Hello Monster. Nice to see you again.
03/08/17, 16:51 - Amin: Fuck that shit infected
03/08/17, 16:52 - Amin: Im no monster

03/08/17, 16:56 - Janith: Not my field of interest
03/08/17, 16:56 - Lulu: I'm not so concerned about how the world thinks of my outward appearance, it doesn't mean I'm a slob it just means I'm not gonna change to impress people I don't give a rats Ass about 😭😭
03/08/17, 16:56 - Amin: I know I never want to be bot perfect
03/08/17, 16:56 - Amin: I want to be awsome

03/08/17, 16:57 - Lulu: And working on my life
03/08/17, 16:57 - Infected: The last time I was "attractive" I was raped. It's not exactly a state I care to exist in. Which is why I was asking for logical reasons to change my appearance for other people.
03/08/17, 16:57 - Lulu: You literally don't know what I'm doing in my life?
03/08/17, 16:57 - Tel: I understand Amin doing this, but unclear on Fabio
03/08/17, 16:57 - Amin: Finaly

03/08/17, 16:58 - FABIO: Just..wish someone had sayd it To me
03/08/17, 16:58 - Janith: I don't change haircut. I just have 'nearly bald' or 'overdue for a haircut'
03/08/17, 16:58 - FABIO: When younger
03/08/17, 16:58 - Amin: U raped because u didnt know self defence
03/08/17, 16:58 - Tel: Well, you've said it a lot now..

03/08/17, 16:58 - Amin: Learn self defence instead of being fat
03/08/17, 16:58 - Tel: Wowzer. Amin, be careful dude
03/08/17, 16:58 - Amin: And kill the next motherfucker tried to rape u
03/08/17, 16:58 - Lulu: Says the guy who made a joke that he raped someone before
03/08/17, 16:58 - Amin: Except me
03/08/17, 16:58 - Janith: 🤦‍♂
03/08/17, 16:58 - Infected: I know self defense. I wasn't prepared for that particular situation. Body mechanics.
03/08/17, 16:59 - Janith: It's like talking with children sometimes
03/08/17, 16:59 - Lulu: Honestly
03/08/17, 16:59 - FABIO: If you get1.robed
03/08/17, 16:59 - Janith: Except children tend to understand faster
03/08/17, 16:59 - Infected: I'm not offended. I processed the incident and adjusted for future reference.
03/08/17, 16:59 - Amin: U lost, accept the truth, be ready for next time, dont loose so goddamn easy
03/08/17, 16:59 - FABIO: Is your foult.. or1 the robbers foult
03/08/17, 16:59 - FABIO: ?
03/08/17, 17:00 - Lulu: Are you saying it's her fault she got raped? Lol
03/08/17, 17:00 - Lulu: Stop being dumb
03/08/17, 17:00 - FABIO: To me. Is both
03/08/17, 17:00 - Infected: I've made adjustments for future reference.
03/08/17, 17:00 - Janith: Are you really comparing rape to robbery?
03/08/17, 17:00 - Amin: Yeah
03/08/17, 17:00 - FABIO: No
03/08/17, 17:00 - Lulu: Yes
03/08/17, 17:00 - Janith: Oh good
03/08/17, 17:00 - Infected: I don't disagree with this point.
03/08/17, 17:01 - Amin: Uve loosed ur beauty honey, ur beauty, UR GODDAMN BEAUTY
03/08/17, 17:01 - Amin: Take whats urs back
03/08/17, 17:01 - FABIO: But its the truth
03/08/17, 17:01 - Amin: Take it back mushroom
03/08/17, 17:01 - Infected: Beauty is a superficial visible attribute.
03/08/17, 17:01 - FABIO: There is danger1 out.there
03/08/17, 17:01 - FABIO: Or you defend yourself
03/08/17, 17:01 - Amin: Fuck that shit
03/08/17, 17:01 - FABIO: Or dont go out
03/08/17, 17:01 - Amin: No one else does
03/08/17, 17:01 - Tel: It's not your fault, to be clear. If someone does something wrong, they're the ones taking action. 

That's a very clear logical line.
03/08/17, 17:02 - Lulu: Someone will always be stronger, someone will always be smarter, predators are opportunists and the only way to avoid is to be super aware at all times, not wear heels for a fast get away, and keeping a weapon or spray on you for most women
03/08/17, 17:02 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: What was that victim blaming
03/08/17, 17:02 - Janith: Rape, robbery, whatever. All situations have a complex interplay of factors. Hard to determine root cause with generalizations
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: Infected
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: Take ut beauty back
03/08/17, 17:02 - Tel: This. 

You can never prepare entirely against something.
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: Face ur fears
03/08/17, 17:02 - FABIO: Yeah.. but easy to protect
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: Face em
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: Man up
03/08/17, 17:02 - Lulu: Fabio what would you do if your girlfriend got raped
03/08/17, 17:02 - Amin: And do it
03/08/17, 17:02 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬: True
03/08/17, 17:02 - FABIO: Rape him back
03/08/17, 17:03 - Amin: And dont listen to bullshit
03/08/17, 17:03 - Tel: No, you can always be robbed. It's a bit naive to say you can protect against it
03/08/17, 17:03 - Infected: Indeed. I don't supply enough information to determine causation. I'm enjoying the assumptions.
03/08/17, 17:03 - Lulu: Whose fault was it
03/08/17, 17:03 - Janith: Didn't think you were bi @554691068741
03/08/17, 17:03 - FABIO: Both
03/08/17, 17:03 - Amin: He wouldn't make her fat
03/08/17, 17:03 - FABIO: Im not... but i find some stuf to stick.in his ass
03/08/17, 17:03 - Infected: Agreed.
03/08/17, 17:03 - Lulu: So you're gonna tell her it's partly her fault she got rapedk
03/08/17, 17:03 - Lulu: You'd lose her real quick man
03/08/17, 17:03 - FABIO: Yes
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: Like when she was almost robbed
03/08/17, 17:04 - Lulu: Unless she is a dependant
03/08/17, 17:04 - Amin: Her gf is infp
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: She didnt saw the guy
03/08/17, 17:04 - Lulu: Robbery is not the same as rape lol
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: She could.have run
03/08/17, 17:04 - Amin: U cant be harsh on them
03/08/17, 17:04 - Tel: Ouch.
03/08/17, 17:04 - Infected: I can't change other people's behavior but I can change my own and prepare for similar situations.
03/08/17, 17:04 - Janith: Not sure who I pity more 😂
Fabio or the girlfriend
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: 😂😂
03/08/17, 17:04 - Tel: Instead of focusing on your weight, I'd focus on your Fe ;)
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: I always1.tell1 the truth
03/08/17, 17:04 - FABIO: To her
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: I almost got.robed
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: Several times
03/08/17, 17:05 - Janith: No you don't
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: I always saw
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: Before hand
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: And avoided it
03/08/17, 17:05 - Lulu: I always see as well
03/08/17, 17:05 - Janith: You're generalizing
03/08/17, 17:05 - Lulu: But not everyone is as observant
03/08/17, 17:05 - Lulu: And not everyone can see it coming
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: Thats whey their.foult
03/08/17, 17:05 - Amin: Mushroom u do what I say, or Im coming to us in 2 years, and Im gonna couch my self , got it, u need a fucking military supervising u
03/08/17, 17:05 - Tel: Exactly
03/08/17, 17:05 - Janith: You can't always tell the truth to an INFP
03/08/17, 17:05 - FABIO: 😂😂
03/08/17, 17:05 - Lulu: That's not really their fault
03/08/17, 17:06 - FABIO: Yes it is
03/08/17, 17:06 - Lulu: Some people weren't raised to need to be cautious
03/08/17, 17:06 - Janith: And even most other types. INTPs included
03/08/17, 17:06 - FABIO: Your life. Is.yours to defend
03/08/17, 17:06 - Infected: I'm told I need supervision.
03/08/17, 17:06 - FABIO: If you cant
03/08/17, 17:06 - FABIO: Is your foult
03/08/17, 17:06 - Tel: OK.. So are children to blame when they're raped, etc, too?
03/08/17, 17:06 - Tel: Is there a line to draw there, or not?
03/08/17, 17:06 - Janith: But that's a problem of human nature
03/08/17, 17:06 - Lulu: I bet he'll say its the parents fault
03/08/17, 17:06 - FABIO: Hmmm
. Good point
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: She is not a children
03/08/17, 17:07 - Infected: Human nature in itself is problematic.
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: So didnt think of it
03/08/17, 17:07 - Amin: I hope u lost weight before I get there, because my method is fast, harsh, and efficient, with best results available, unlike u, I get things done
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: Dont thibk children to blame
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: They are naturally dumb
03/08/17, 17:07 - Tel: The same factors are involved - awareness, strength, etc.
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: Dont understand1 the workd
03/08/17, 17:07 - FABIO: Children cant use guns
03/08/17, 17:07 - Tel: But they have survival instincts, etc.
03/08/17, 17:07 - Infected: That would be an interesting experiment. You have my permission to proceed.
03/08/17, 17:07 - Lulu: You think everyone is carrying a gun all the time lol
03/08/17, 17:08 - Tel: Yes they can. Have you seen the number of child shooting of parents in the USA per year?
03/08/17, 17:08 - Tel: Or child soldiers?
03/08/17, 17:08 - FABIO: Shoukd
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: 😂😅😅
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: Dudes
03/08/17, 17:08 - FABIO: 😂😂😂
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: As long as I have done low quality
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: These past days
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: Im gonna leave
03/08/17, 17:08 - Tel: You need to defend your logic re difference for adult and child
03/08/17, 17:08 - Tel: :)
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: And come back
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: Later
03/08/17, 17:08 - Amin: About a month maybe
03/08/17, 17:09 - FABIO: Children dont know
03/08/17, 17:09 - FABIO: Adults shlukd
03/08/17, 17:09 - Tel: Well, don't need to, but it doesn't make sense anyway.
03/08/17, 17:09 - FABIO: Should
03/08/17, 17:09 - FABIO: Simply
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: I need to work my as off
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: Ass*
03/08/17, 17:09 - Infected: 👋🏻
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: 😘👋
03/08/17, 17:09 - Lulu: What of a weak adult or teen who has troubles, let's say a knife or pepper spray doesn't work
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: Have fun
03/08/17, 17:09 - Tel: What are you basing this on? 

Are you saying that everyone knows when something bad is going to happen? 

If so, then why do we have any crime?
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: And as I always say
03/08/17, 17:09 - Amin: Bbye suckers 👋👋👋
03/08/17, 17:10 - Lulu: They get raped, they were caught off guard at night they couldn't go fast enough to run away
03/08/17, 17:10 - Amin saiu
03/08/17, 17:10 - FABIO: Almost
03/08/17, 17:10 - FABIO: But we need to be aware
03/08/17, 17:10 - FABIO: Or face1 the.consequences
03/08/17, 17:10 - Lulu: Yes we do
03/08/17, 17:10 - Lulu: But not everyone is
03/08/17, 17:10 - Lulu: Not everyone is taught to
03/08/17, 17:10 - FABIO: I think. Is politics job to end robbery1 and rape
03/08/17, 17:10 - Tel: You can't be aware all the time. When will you ever sleep?
03/08/17, 17:10 - Lulu: And no everyone has the same mindset or upbringing
03/08/17, 17:10 - Infected: We do have primal instinct.
03/08/17, 17:10 - FABIO: But is.yours to avoid as max as can
03/08/17, 17:10 - Tel: Yea.. But max isn't 100%
03/08/17, 17:11 - FABIO: Thats why both foult
03/08/17, 17:11 - Tel: So you can't blame them. Also, it doesn't matter if we take no precautions. 

If someone else does something bad, then it's their fault and their decision - not the victims
03/08/17, 17:11 - FABIO: No
03/08/17, 17:11 - Lulu: There are too many varying scenarios to say that 100% of the time they were just weak or not paying attention
03/08/17, 17:11 - Tel: No, I must disagree with your logic. Your logic is really wrong Fabio.
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: Its predator prey here
03/08/17, 17:12 - Infected: I agree
03/08/17, 17:12 - Tel: Seems we're at opposite ends
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: See
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: I think
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: You guys are rigth
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: I wish i could.think as you dok
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: But
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: To me
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: Is darwinism.. i need1 to protect mr
03/08/17, 17:12 - FABIO: Me
03/08/17, 17:13 - FABIO: No one else will
03/08/17, 17:13 - FABIO: If i cant
03/08/17, 17:13 - FABIO: Then i failed
03/08/17, 17:13 - Lulu: I mean man I understand where you are coming from and your mindset, but I just find it absurd
03/08/17, 17:13 - FABIO: And1 should be extinct
03/08/17, 17:13 - Tel: K, I get that - I don't disagree with protecting yourself. But you can't blame the victim regardless
03/08/17, 17:14 - Lulu: Especially in a ways way to "encourage" someone to lose weight
03/08/17, 17:14 - FABIO: Not blaming as.foult.. but for not taking precautions
03/08/17, 17:14 - Lulu: That's the thing tho sometimes it doesn't matter how prepared you are
03/08/17, 17:14 - Janith: @554691068741 you're application of Darwinism is flawed
03/08/17, 17:14 - Tel: This
03/08/17, 17:14 - Lulu: It's lifw
03/08/17, 17:15 - Lulu: Life*
03/08/17, 17:15 - Lulu: Shit happens
03/08/17, 17:15 - Infected: I've observed suffiently to add another detail. I was raped by my bf at the time. Continue.
03/08/17, 17:15 - Janith: You're taking survival of the fittest at face value. That's not how it's described
03/08/17, 17:15 - Lulu: Good shit bad shit life changing shit
03/08/17, 17:15 - FABIO: Its.how it works for me
03/08/17, 17:16 - FABIO: For myself
03/08/17, 17:16 - FABIO: I do not blame the.robber
03/08/17, 17:16 - Janith: 😂 I just love how spock-like you are
03/08/17, 17:16 - Janith: Irrelevant. Don't call it Darwinism then. It's inaccurate
03/08/17, 17:17 - Infected: I like to observe the progression of critical theory.
03/08/17, 17:17 - Tel: Question. On what basis are you observing? 

And specifically, are you observing for Fi?
03/08/17, 17:18 - Tel: Even in part
03/08/17, 17:18 - Janith: The dynamic reactions of each party as they bring their ideas and prejudices into the exchange
03/08/17, 17:18 - Janith: I think
03/08/17, 17:18 - Tel: Yea, I'm just wondering whether there's inner turmoil still.. There would be for me I imagine. Idano.
03/08/17, 17:19 - Tel: Private question perhaps, don't need to answer @15015198024
03/08/17, 17:19 - Lulu: See my inner turmoil would be resisting the urge to murder them in their sleep
03/08/17, 17:19 - Tel: :)
03/08/17, 17:19 - Infected: I'm observing the evolution of opinion and thought process as pertains to a developing situation. I.e. I gave no details at the beginning of the conversation. At certain points when the conversation becomes redundant or stagnant, I will add another detail to see how it sways thought and opinion.
03/08/17, 17:19 - Infected: In essence.
03/08/17, 17:20 - Infected: No, I've processed the event in its entirety.
03/08/17, 17:20 - Tel: Hm fair enough
03/08/17, 17:20 - Tel: Good, at least
03/08/17, 17:20 - FABIO: to me
03/08/17, 17:20 - Janith: The little things like this, it's what makes life interesting enough to wonder what the day has in store
03/08/17, 17:20 - FABIO: the world is 1.. and the way i wish it was.. is another
03/08/17, 17:21 - Infected: Agreed.
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: we shouldt have to be afraid of being raped
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: its just wrong
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: or robed
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: but it is not how it is today
03/08/17, 17:21 - Lulu: But sadly
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: police doesnt work
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: politics doest work
03/08/17, 17:21 - Lulu: It happens frequently
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: so its better you take care of yourself
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: and blame you if something goes wrong
03/08/17, 17:21 - FABIO: so you can change
03/08/17, 17:22 - FABIO: its not the rigth mindset
03/08/17, 17:22 - Infected: I agree with that assessment in a general sense.
03/08/17, 17:22 - FABIO: but is the usefull one
03/08/17, 17:22 - Lulu: See I think a lot of time there is nothing to blame but a sequence of unknown variables that effected both parties and how it ended up
03/08/17, 17:22 - Janith: We wish for ideals that can never be achieved
03/08/17, 17:22 - Lulu: Self blame is important up to a point tho
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: yes
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: exactly
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: thats my point
03/08/17, 17:23 - Janith: A perfect us impossible on a fundamental level
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: you need a part of blame.. to change
03/08/17, 17:23 - Lulu: But blaming myself for everything is how I ended up depressed and anxious and almost failing My senior year of highschool lol
03/08/17, 17:23 - Janith: That's what makes life interesting
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: is how i changed and become better
03/08/17, 17:23 - FABIO: to me it worked
03/08/17, 17:24 - Lulu: Life is too short to stress over where blame is placed or not
03/08/17, 17:24 - Janith: Don't need it anymore. Found a better alternative
03/08/17, 17:24 - Lulu: We only have the facts of what we did and how we can fix it
03/08/17, 17:24 - Tel: Words can have important emotional reactions. 

Blame is the wrong word. 

You can reflect and learn without blaming things. This is healthier. You accept something, learn from it, decide on a future action, and move forwards.
03/08/17, 17:24 - Tel: Blaming is associated with negative emotion and opens up the path to negative emotive cycles wirh incorrect logic
03/08/17, 17:25 - Tel: With*
03/08/17, 17:25 - Lulu: Yep
03/08/17, 17:25 - FABIO: hmmm
03/08/17, 17:25 - FABIO: ok
03/08/17, 17:25 - Janith: Indeed
03/08/17, 17:25 - FABIO: accept your part of foult and learning what goes wrong
03/08/17, 17:25 - Infected: I like Tel's assessment.
03/08/17, 17:25 - Tel: Slightly semantic, but I really do believe words are important in setting mindsets
03/08/17, 17:25 - Janith: Whoa...
03/08/17, 17:25 - Lulu: They are
03/08/17, 17:25 - FABIO: they are
03/08/17, 17:25 - Janith: @447903370497 you hot unanimous agreement!!!
03/08/17, 17:26 - Janith: *got
03/08/17, 17:26 - FABIO: i just doesnt knoe them
03/08/17, 17:26 - FABIO: know
03/08/17, 17:26 - Lulu: I'm out of the habit now but it was shit
03/08/17, 17:26 - Tel: Lol. I must have joined an ISTJ group halfway through..
03/08/17, 17:26 - Lulu: And was due to many different things lol
03/08/17, 17:26 - FABIO: must be amasing...
03/08/17, 17:26 - FABIO: lets pop up this discussion
03/08/17, 17:26 - FABIO: there
03/08/17, 17:26 - Infected: What you said was logical.
03/08/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Are you all really having big revelations here or are you just baffled someone could speak obvious sense
03/08/17, 17:27 - Lulu: Just curious
03/08/17, 17:27 - Infected: This is the common sense of a healthy intp mind.
03/08/17, 17:28 - Janith: I'm surprised everyone agreed to something

03/08/17, 17:29 - Janith: Bye Fabio
03/08/17, 17:29 - Lulu: I'd speak more on personal experience but I don't wanna be too self imposing
03/08/17, 17:29 - Lulu: Letting out those insecurities ayee
03/08/17, 17:29 - Lulu: Lmao
03/08/17, 17:29 - Janith: Go for it 😊
03/08/17, 17:30 - Infected: I would enjoy more personal input.
03/08/17, 17:31 - Lulu: Well TBH IDK where to start now
03/08/17, 17:31 - Lulu: Since the convo is going to specific way
03/08/17, 17:32 - Tel: When I was younger, like teenage years, I would have been  much more sympathetic to Fabio's and Amin's points I think.
03/08/17, 17:32 - Lulu: No
03/08/17, 17:32 - Lulu: *
03/08/17, 17:32 - Janith: Well... We started on Infected with binomial nomenclature
03/08/17, 17:33 - Tel: I think it's a mixture of ill developed Fe and my reflecting parts of society (the latter feels like a cop out.. But I do know of other examples where I was less than accurate with my thinking)
03/08/17, 17:33 - Janith: I was too at one point. Guess it's a phase
03/08/17, 17:34 - Lulu: I passed the class I needed to pass highschool with with a 59.6 which rounded to the passing grade of a 60
03/08/17, 17:34 - Lulu: Bless my teacher for his understanding
03/08/17, 17:34 - Lulu: Lmao
03/08/17, 17:34 - Infected: I thought it was funny.
03/08/17, 17:34 - Tel: Lol handy
03/08/17, 17:35 - Janith: Nice teacher you had
03/08/17, 17:35 - Lulu: Great teacher
03/08/17, 17:35 - Infected: Agreed.
03/08/17, 17:35 - Lulu: He Gave me a lot of make up work that I never handed in from the first semester
03/08/17, 17:35 - Janith: (you should agree too @447903370497)
03/08/17, 17:36 - Tel: Never heard of that phrase before.. Dictionary and wiki not helping without the context?
03/08/17, 17:36 - Tel: I agree I should agree
03/08/17, 17:36 - Tel: Agreed.
03/08/17, 17:37 - Janith: It's scientific classification of living beings
03/08/17, 17:37 - Infected: Amin asked me for my family name. I listed off the family and genus of the shitake mushroom.
03/08/17, 17:37 - Tel: Lol ok
03/08/17, 17:37 - Tel: That's the info I was missing
03/08/17, 17:37 - Janith: Yet another unanimous point. 
The proto-hive mind is in fire today
03/08/17, 17:38 - Janith: *on
03/08/17, 17:38 - Janith: Damn keyboard 😅
03/08/17, 17:38 - Tel: Why has he been calling you mushroom - because of that? Or you say the shitake because he called you mushroom.?
03/08/17, 17:38 - Infected: The latter
03/08/17, 17:38 - Tel: So yea, why has he been calling you mushroom? Any known rationale?
03/08/17, 17:39 - Arne: The Kazoo Kid
03/08/17, 17:39 - Lulu: wow
03/08/17, 17:39 - Arne: Correction, Amin
03/08/17, 17:39 - Lulu: i connected my whatsapp to my laptop
03/08/17, 17:39 - Tel: !
03/08/17, 17:39 - Infected: My sn is infected. He correlated that to fungi, for some reason.
03/08/17, 17:39 - Lulu: thank god for technology and keyboards
03/08/17, 17:39 - Lulu: i prefer this much better
03/08/17, 17:39 - Tel: K that's what I guessed earlier. Simple as then
03/08/17, 17:40 - Janith: Sn? Sinus?
03/08/17, 17:40 - Infected: Screen name.
03/08/17, 17:40 - Janith: 😂 oh
03/08/17, 17:40 - Lulu: sinus infections suck tho
03/08/17, 17:40 - Infected: Indeed

03/08/17, 17:41 - Infected: Hive mind +3
03/08/17, 17:41 - Tel: Hahaha
03/08/17, 17:41 - Lulu: lmao
03/08/17, 17:42 - Infected: A borg ship full of assimilated vulcans.
03/08/17, 17:42 - Tel: We are the INTP. 
Resistance is amusing and will be added to our Si collective through Ne interaction.
03/08/17, 17:42 - Infected: This.
03/08/17, 17:42 - Tel: Or, rather..
03/08/17, 17:42 - Lulu: flamingos
03/08/17, 17:42 - Tel: We are the INTP. 
Resistance, if amusing, will be added to our Si collective through Ne interaction.
03/08/17, 17:42 - Tel: 😂
03/08/17, 17:42 - Tel: One word changed, big difference
03/08/17, 17:42 - Maureen: hey guys
03/08/17, 17:43 - Lulu: hey maurs
03/08/17, 17:43 - Infected: That earns an emoji 😂
03/08/17, 17:43 - Infected: Greetings

03/08/17, 17:43 - Lulu: 👁👃👁
03/08/17, 17:43 - Maureen: I just thought about istj groups
03/08/17, 17:43 - Tel: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 17:43 - Maureen: they would totally kill each other
03/08/17, 17:43 - Maureen: right?
03/08/17, 17:44 - Infected: Probable
03/08/17, 17:44 - Janith: Right
03/08/17, 17:44 - Lulu: tbh, whenever you guys list off random mbti personalities and use it to refer to people and things and situations
03/08/17, 17:44 - Maureen: 👅
03/08/17, 17:44 - Lulu: i have no fucking idea whats going on
03/08/17, 17:44 - Lulu: because i havent read in debth or care to read into the types lmao
03/08/17, 17:45 - Janith: Dammit @14843534493 you were supposed to agree to that 😂
03/08/17, 17:45 - Infected: I only have a basic understanding of mbti. I didn't research it in depth.
03/08/17, 17:45 - Lulu: maureen thats genius
03/08/17, 17:45 - Maureen: same, but I typed a colleague and read into it
03/08/17, 17:45 - Lulu: i mean
03/08/17, 17:45 - Lulu: by in debth  i meanth
03/08/17, 17:45 - Lulu: a quick skim
03/08/17, 17:46 - Tel: There's that 'in depth' comment again.. Haha. I guess you're with INTPs, so we'll interpret it relatively speaking
03/08/17, 17:46 - Maureen: well, I have a person in mind and think e or i, s or n, ...
03/08/17, 17:46 - Maureen: then read into it and it mostly fits perfectly
03/08/17, 17:46 - Infected: More than a quick slim but less than an in depth study - intp research style.
03/08/17, 17:46 - Lulu: there we go thats where my typo was
03/08/17, 17:46 - Infected: Skim.
03/08/17, 17:46 - Tel: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 17:46 - Lulu: aka i havent taken the time to read into all the types lol
03/08/17, 17:47 - Lulu: truly my research style
03/08/17, 17:47 - Infected: I glanced at the functions.
03/08/17, 17:47 - Janith: Well I'm gonna go for real this time. See you in 6 hours or so 👋
03/08/17, 17:47 - Maureen: I read into a few but can't remember anything but istp and intp
03/08/17, 17:47 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 17:47 - Infected: 👋🏻
03/08/17, 17:47 - Lulu: here r some tabs
03/08/17, 17:47 - Tel: The functions are the important bit. They're the jigsaw that build the picture of full types
03/08/17, 17:48 - Infected: Nice
03/08/17, 17:48 - Lulu: i know its a weak amount
03/08/17, 17:48 - Infected: It's good for light reading
03/08/17, 17:48 - Infected: You should have seen my laptop when I was researching chess last night.
03/08/17, 17:49 - Lulu: chess
03/08/17, 17:49 - Lulu: huh
03/08/17, 17:49 - Lulu: nice
03/08/17, 17:49 - Tel: @15015198024 you play chess?!
03/08/17, 17:49 - Infected: As of last night.

03/08/17, 17:49 - Infected: Starred.

03/08/17, 17:50 - Tel: What do stars actually do?

03/08/17, 17:50 - Tel: Lolol
03/08/17, 17:51 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 17:51 - Infected: I star comments but instead of looking for the star, I scroll back to the comment.
03/08/17, 17:51 - Tel: Hopefully my screenie saves you time in future then
03/08/17, 17:51 - Infected: That's more useful.
03/08/17, 17:52 - Tel: Might wanna star it..
03/08/17, 17:52 - Tel: :p
03/08/17, 17:52 - Infected: I already have.
03/08/17, 17:52 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 17:53 - Tel: What does rn mean?
03/08/17, 17:53 - Infected: Right now
03/08/17, 17:53 - Infected: Or Registered Nurse, depending on context.
03/08/17, 17:53 - Tel: Ah k. I can. I'm just watching LotR, fellowship, atm
03/08/17, 17:53 - Lulu: savfhkdzvnzdjnlzgvdbS
03/08/17, 17:53 - Lulu: sorry for spazzing
03/08/17, 17:53 - Tel: Yea, that's more what I'm used to
03/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 17:54 - Maureen: I've never played cards against humanity
03/08/17, 17:54 - Lulu: u mentioned a show and i remembered the new season of voltron legendary defenders comes out tomorrow
03/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: Oooh
03/08/17, 17:55 - Infected: I'm not proficient enough at chess to play in real time with human competitors.
03/08/17, 17:55 - Maureen: I would
03/08/17, 17:56 - Tel: Can play it with 3 day timer. That's my general way of doing it
03/08/17, 17:56 - Tel: Ditto
03/08/17, 17:57 - Infected: As a general rule, I don't play with people unless I can beat the a.i. on hard mode at an average of 3 wins out of 5.
03/08/17, 17:57 - Tel: Ah fair enough
03/08/17, 17:57 - Tel: AI is pretty advanced tbh
03/08/17, 17:57 - Maureen: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 17:57 - Tel: Best AI beats best human these days
03/08/17, 17:57 - Infected: Which would give me average proficiency and a base knowledge to expand on.
03/08/17, 17:58 - Tel: So get a crap phone and you might be ok.. If you use decent tech w/ good ram, then yea, you might never get there
03/08/17, 17:59 - Infected: That's not the point to me lol I want to be good enough in my own estimation.
03/08/17, 17:59 - Maureen: sorry... I need to know: do we play or not?
03/08/17, 17:59 - Tel: Yea, I'm just noting you may be setting yourself up too high there. I'd recommend the chess.com app and, if you can beat it regularly at 1400, then that would be a decent enough level
03/08/17, 18:00 - Maureen: else I would watch another episode 😂
03/08/17, 18:00 - Infected: Noted.
03/08/17, 18:00 - Tel: I say that level because that's where I'm at, so it's not exactly an easy level, but not grandmaster level either
03/08/17, 18:00 - Infected: What are you watching? I want to do some more research before I play chess in a competitive setting.
03/08/17, 18:01 - Maureen: I meant cards against humanity 
but I'm rewatching grey's anatomy
03/08/17, 18:01 - Tel: Oo what series? I stopped at 10/11 I think.
03/08/17, 18:01 - Infected: I never got into that show. Can you play CAH online?
03/08/17, 18:02 - Infected: I'm currently watching Westworld.
03/08/17, 18:02 - Tel: Oo great series. S2 out in '18! Woo!
03/08/17, 18:02 - Infected: Great.
03/08/17, 18:02 - Maureen: since @14843534493 wanted to make a room i guess so
03/08/17, 18:03 - Circle: Omg 1590 msgs
03/08/17, 18:03 - Maureen: rewatching season 10, but I'm waiting for season 14 to come out in sep
03/08/17, 18:03 - Maureen: totally normal
03/08/17, 18:03 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 18:03 - Circle: 😱
03/08/17, 18:03 - Infected: That's around what I had when I got on this morning.
03/08/17, 18:04 - Circle: And did you read all the convos ?
03/08/17, 18:04 - Tel: I think the avg per day might decrease without Amin, and the talk be starkly different
03/08/17, 18:04 - Circle: Haha
03/08/17, 18:04 - Tel: I generally skim read to catch up
03/08/17, 18:05 - Circle: Tel what do you do for a living i noticed you get up early
03/08/17, 18:05 - Tel: Mgr in the NHS - head of outpatients at a London hospital
03/08/17, 18:05 - Tel: You?
03/08/17, 18:05 - Circle: Wow
03/08/17, 18:05 - ‪+1 (829) 304-8225‬ saiu

03/08/17, 18:06 - Arne: Hello darkness my old friend
03/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: Hence I'm also chatting a lot during the day.. Won't last forever, but for a few weeks perhaps
03/08/17, 18:06 - Circle: Erm .... LOL after that i feel the need to make something up haha im a taxi controller/dispatcher soon to be driver
03/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: Haha, defo don't need to. I started out as someone who folded clothes in Primark 😁
03/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: Joyous times...
03/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: Cool, that sounds pretty liberating tbh
03/08/17, 18:08 - Circle: Ahaha im too old to be starting out im 26 😅
03/08/17, 18:08 - Infected: I did.
03/08/17, 18:08 - Circle: You are a brave woman
03/08/17, 18:09 - Infected: In terms of social constructs, you're all doing quite a bit better than I am.
03/08/17, 18:09 - Infected: I'm nosey. Shh lol
03/08/17, 18:10 - Circle: What do you do if you dont mind me asking
03/08/17, 18:10 - Tel: Lolol
03/08/17, 18:11 - Infected: I draw a check from the government because they have deemed me mentally unfit to hold a job in which I interact with people.
03/08/17, 18:12 - Circle: Would you be offended if i asked how ?
03/08/17, 18:12 - Circle: As in how you are mentally unfit because so far you sound normal!
03/08/17, 18:13 - Arne: Depression?
03/08/17, 18:16 - Tel: Definition of normal =?
03/08/17, 18:16 - Circle: So intps are deffo prone to depression then
03/08/17, 18:16 - Arne: Copycat
03/08/17, 18:17 - Circle: Tel im trying to inconspicuously coax things out of her stop being pompous
03/08/17, 18:17 - Tel: Hm, I can't answer for others, but I can say that I have experienced depression (clinically defined or not)
03/08/17, 18:17 - Infected: Being around people for a prolonged amount of times can make me exhibit violent behavior.
03/08/17, 18:17 - Tel: Lol, apologies for being conspicuous
03/08/17, 18:17 - Arne: Not necessarily, i thought it also had something to do with your genes
03/08/17, 18:18 - Infected: You can just ask. It doesn't bother me.
03/08/17, 18:19 - Circle: Gosh i love intps most people get so offended
03/08/17, 18:19 - Tel: Haha
03/08/17, 18:19 - Tahnacious: Very pretty :) I love this. My birthday is next month, may I have a cake? 😁
03/08/17, 18:20 - Circle: So do you know what makes you feel violent ? 
I just feel so drained around people like they are sucking my soul out
03/08/17, 18:20 - Circle: @61477394075 aww thankyou it tasted like shit
03/08/17, 18:20 - Tel: OK. Question: do you formalise your diction deliberately to create distance between yourself and those you're in conversation with?

I note that your way of communicating fluctuates slightly, and your restrained use of emoji earlier was interesting..
03/08/17, 18:21 - Infected: I believe it to be an anxiety issue.
03/08/17, 18:21 - Tel: LOL
03/08/17, 18:21 - Infected: You're observant.
03/08/17, 18:22 - Circle: 😆
03/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: You're thinking ;)
03/08/17, 18:23 - Tel: Don't need to answer tbh. Just wondered if you knew the answer yourself.
03/08/17, 18:23 - Circle: I think she knows why
03/08/17, 18:24 - Tel: Or if I was barkingup the wrong tree
03/08/17, 18:24 - Infected: I tend to formalize my speech when in my neutral state.
03/08/17, 18:25 - Tel: Any reason why?
03/08/17, 18:26 - Tel: I formalise my language when in frustrated state
03/08/17, 18:26 - Tel: When I argue, it's possible that I'll start calling an older fella 'sir'.. :D
03/08/17, 18:26 - Tel: Weird quirk.
03/08/17, 18:27 - Circle: Same especially when writing
03/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: Staying in a neutral state is superlative to not going manic.
03/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: I think it's a control on my own emotions by deliberately being more formal
03/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: K, so similar then, I think?
03/08/17, 18:27 - Tel: Interesting
03/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: Yes.
03/08/17, 18:28 - Circle: Hmm
03/08/17, 18:29 - Tel: Manic is a word used in terms of bi-polar / manic depressive.. 

I would have thought panic attack would have been a more apt description based on the very little info given. Though panic attacks are, from my Ltd understanding, more debilitating than energising.
03/08/17, 18:29 - Tel: Interesting
03/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: My Fe (when lesser developed or out of control) has previously been the source of my outbursts.
03/08/17, 18:30 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: Ahh bpd
03/08/17, 18:30 - Tel: My sis has that
03/08/17, 18:30 - Infected: My staying within my intp state of mind, I do not enter into a manic emotional state.
03/08/17, 18:31 - Tel: I literally do not understand how to help her or have a relationship with her. Some sort of mutual aid would be good here
03/08/17, 18:31 - Infected: I tend to be more robotic.
03/08/17, 18:32 - Tel: Yea, I understand a bit better now. It's debilitating, I think, but not in terms of external actions
03/08/17, 18:32 - Tel: Interestingly, she doesn't. She's not intp though; she's INFP maybe
03/08/17, 18:32 - Tel: Haven't actually thought about it, tbh
03/08/17, 18:33 - Infected: Bpd is internal. It completely alters state of mind and perception. I had to study myself for years to learn how to cope with a certain amount of success.
03/08/17, 18:34 - Tel: So does that you mean you consciously restrict your Fe development, or do you develop it internally but not let it out? Or have you developed Fi over Fe preference?
03/08/17, 18:34 - Infected: There are days when I will appear completely different than I do now. Almost like DID
03/08/17, 18:36 - Infected: I internalize emotions so that I can process them. I never give an emotional reaction unless I have thought it through and determined it to be appropriate
03/08/17, 18:37 - Circle: Unless u are in public ?
03/08/17, 18:37 - Tel: Intriguing. I do something similar tbh. I internalise and process, and only externalise when in certain environs or situations / with trusted ppl, or in the moment if I think it's OK to do so (more likely to be incorrect in the latter!)
03/08/17, 18:38 - Infected: Unless I lose control.
03/08/17, 18:39 - Circle: Ok , i always wanted to read up on mental illness in relation to personality types specifically the more rarer types its very fascinating
03/08/17, 18:40 - Infected: The purpose of staying in a neutral state is so that I can head off rapid cycling emotions (manic state) before the urge to act out physically or aggressively becomes overwhelming.
03/08/17, 18:41 - Tel: Hm, this makes me think of one's ability to rapidly process emotions, deal with them, and respond to the situation at the same time. 

This is an Fi trait I guess.. So seems you're more keenly aware of your emotions than a typical INTP?
03/08/17, 18:42 - Circle: Im still having some difficulty understanding.  What triggers you in those situations ? Is it when someone has generally angered you or is it like someone says hello and you want to punch them in the face
03/08/17, 18:43 - Tahnacious: That is what happened to me
03/08/17, 18:43 - Tel: Keenly aware but not able to sort through / deal with.. Like a hurricane whereby everything is flying around. You know that there are lots of things in the air, but not sure exactly what.. Or quick enough to grasp it even if you did identify
03/08/17, 18:43 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 18:44 - Infected: I'm more keenly aware of emotions, yes.
03/08/17, 18:44 - Infected: Different things will trigger me in different situations. It's not always easy to determine what will set off an episode.
03/08/17, 18:44 - Tahnacious: If I knew 100% I could get away with it and there was a decent reward I could be inclined. If I wasn't so clumsy I'd think I'd make a decent assassin actually.
03/08/17, 18:45 - Tel: Was the metaphor accurate?
03/08/17, 18:46 - Infected: This is accurate. The emotions are coming at me faster than I can process them and determine action therefore I short circuit and act out.
03/08/17, 18:47 - Tel: K
03/08/17, 18:47 - Tahnacious: I could've probably used this as a copy paste result all night.
03/08/17, 18:47 - Tel: Hm. Frustrating that there's no trigger, or theme behind it. That's how I am able to react quicker - it's because I've already planned my reaction, if that makes sense..
03/08/17, 18:48 - Tel: The chimp paradox - you might find it interesting. Steve Peters is the dude that came up with it
03/08/17, 18:48 - Tahnacious: For me it would be poison, means I don't have to see it and I don't have to get my hands too dirty.
03/08/17, 18:49 - Infected: It makes sense
03/08/17, 18:49 - Tel: Lol, I'm now imagining anyone joining and just reading @61477394075 's comments..
03/08/17, 18:50 - Infected: I'll look into it
03/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: https://youtu.be/R-KI1D5NPJs

You may or may not find it useful, though hopefully it's interesting
03/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: He's funny too I think
03/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: I saw him live at an NHS thing
03/08/17, 18:50 - Infected: I starred it for later.
03/08/17, 18:51 - Tel: Apols, 'solution' mode rather than intrigue. It's the less satisfying part of a convo I think, particularly when inaccurate ;)
03/08/17, 18:51 - Tahnacious: It is what I would consider low fantasy. The world in game of thrones seems to be loosely geographically based on Europe, with Kings landing being somewhat of a substitute for London and The Wall being a substitute for Hadrian's wall, etc.
03/08/17, 18:52 - Tel: It is based on earthly history tho
03/08/17, 18:52 - Circle: Yes like the red wedding
03/08/17, 18:53 - Tel: Yea, Wales I think?
03/08/17, 18:53 - Tel: French royal family, Hadrians wall, huns..
03/08/17, 18:55 - Circle: Ahah
03/08/17, 18:55 - Circle: I love game of thrones sad to know its ending
03/08/17, 18:55 - Tel: I dislike that Sean Bean always dies so early in his characters. He's like a serial murderee
03/08/17, 18:56 - Circle: do any of you guys enjoy psychological thrillers ? Like shutter island etc
03/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: (Ps he just died as Boromir)
03/08/17, 18:56 - Circle: Haha
03/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Yea, but everyone makes them out to be way more complex than they are. Like the Leo Dicaprio one.. Dreams in dreams..
03/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Inception*
03/08/17, 18:57 - Circle: Haha yeah inception wasnt deep at all !
03/08/17, 18:57 - Tel: Yea, fairly simple.
03/08/17, 18:57 - Tel: I preferred Pans Labyrinth..
03/08/17, 18:57 - Tel: More meaningful
03/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: But totally satisfied my Ne
03/08/17, 18:58 - Circle: I guess it might be deep for those who dont ponder about anything and suddenly an interesting premises is forced upon hence forcing them to think LOL
03/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: Yea I think you're right both
03/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: Tbh*
03/08/17, 18:58 - Tahnacious: I have done this before but I don't know if it is normal, it is just something I can relate to.
03/08/17, 18:59 - Circle: I do wish they made deep psychological thrillers . It's mostly just a twist at the end like the others
03/08/17, 18:59 - Infected: Good movie
03/08/17, 18:59 - Infected: I liked shutter island. I haven't seen inception.
03/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: Yup, agreed
03/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: Shutter island is good. Deeper than inception from what I remember. Esp emotionally
03/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: Hm, A Monster Calls. Now that's a good film
03/08/17, 19:00 - Infected: Have you seen Frailty?
03/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: Think same director as pans?
03/08/17, 19:01 - Infected: That is on my list.
03/08/17, 19:01 - Tel: Highly recommend
03/08/17, 19:01 - Circle: @61477394075 i think the question is ... what is love 🎼
03/08/17, 19:02 - Circle: No i havent i am going to watch it if you reccomend i think you guys are the first group of people whose advice on what to watch or read il actually take haha
03/08/17, 19:03 - Tel: I think @918123428275 was right.. It's a natural yearning I think, at least for me
03/08/17, 19:03 - Tahnacious: This.
03/08/17, 19:04 - Tahnacious: That doesn't seem to be relevant, my parents never appeared to be in love and that doesn't seem to have affected me in a way that lead to me mimicking their relationship.
03/08/17, 19:04 - Circle: Ye , love for me is formed from codependency the more you need someone the closer you feel and before that i believe its called lust
03/08/17, 19:04 - Tahnacious: Just as an example
03/08/17, 19:04 - Infected: I'm watching the nice guys right now. It's amusing.
03/08/17, 19:05 - Circle: Have any of you guys watched split ?
03/08/17, 19:05 - Infected: I just wanted to see what he was going to say, tbh.
03/08/17, 19:05 - Infected: Not yet.
03/08/17, 19:05 - Tel: Hm.. Interesting.
03/08/17, 19:06 - Tel: No. Good?
03/08/17, 19:06 - Infected: I'm not a fan of codependency in relationships.
03/08/17, 19:06 - Circle: I havent watched it yey
03/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: I think you're right. Depends on how specific you wanna be. 

Lust re physical / mental attraction, sure.. I'm stuck at the codependency statement though.
03/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: Like @15015198024 it seems
03/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: Maybe diff reasons
03/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: Maybe the same
03/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: Who knows
03/08/17, 19:08 - Circle: I am a fan of it . I think the more you depend on each other for emotional, sexual, financial or spiritual needs the deeper your love will feel . But i would love to know why you jave opposing thoughts
03/08/17, 19:09 - Infected: True compatible to me is a complimentary relationship. Two whole people able to handle their own responsibilities that come together to compliment each other.
03/08/17, 19:09 - Tel: Not necessarily opposing; more just stuck.
03/08/17, 19:09 - Tahnacious: Pretty much what I was doing 🤣
03/08/17, 19:11 - Infected: Compatibility *
03/08/17, 19:12 - Circle: I have often pondered why relationships in the past have lastes longer , i do know its partly because it was looked down upon to divorce but i also believe there was a clear need being fulfilled by either party eg the man being the earner and the woman being the home maker . Please correct me if you think otherwise
03/08/17, 19:13 - Circle: also obviously people werr more willing to compromise before
03/08/17, 19:14 - Infected: I think in many instances, that is the case. I can only speak on love from the limit of my personal understanding. Love itself, the science of it apart, is a personal view based on the individuals perception and idea.
03/08/17, 19:16 - Circle: Thats true , i aim to be content in my marriage rather then floaty love bubbles so i may be very biased also i have only been married 6 years 😂
03/08/17, 19:17 - Tel: Congrats ;)
03/08/17, 19:17 - Tel: :) *
03/08/17, 19:17 - Circle: Congrats on lasting 6 years or being married 😋
03/08/17, 19:17 - Tel: Yup!
03/08/17, 19:18 - Tel: I was with someone for 6 years and then ended it. I both regret it and I'm glad
03/08/17, 19:18 - Infected: My longest relationship has been around 3 years but it was on and off. I don't think I would be content in a marriage contract. Possibly, if it were prearranged.
03/08/17, 19:20 - Circle: After the initial lust wore off i have been using my own theories to make the marriage last because in all honesty i dont believe in love ... could be i just havent had it but it does exist
03/08/17, 19:22 - Infected: I believe in the probability of love but I don't have enough experience with healthy relationships to say it is something I have any experience with.
03/08/17, 19:22 - Circle: Dont get me wrong though i do love my husband but for the reasons i mentioned earlier because i may just be selfish but i believe that relationships are based on give and take
03/08/17, 19:23 - Circle: In my experience unhealthy relationships are the most fun !
03/08/17, 19:23 - Infected: In essence, yes. Complimentary relationships would have a certain amount of give and take.
03/08/17, 19:23 - Infected: They can be fun.
03/08/17, 19:24 - Circle: They can also be volatile the next day 🤣
03/08/17, 19:25 - Infected: Yes, which is one reason I avoid relationships.
03/08/17, 19:25 - Circle: Dont you think humans need partnerds?
03/08/17, 19:26 - Infected: I have to stay in my neutral state to maintain optimum mental health. Volatile and unexpected situations tend to not help with that.
03/08/17, 19:26 - Circle: LOL not partnerds but partners
03/08/17, 19:26 - Infected: Not necessarily.
03/08/17, 19:26 - Tel: Hm, If you were able to control it and have the relationship, though - would you?
03/08/17, 19:27 - Infected: If it were a complimentary relationship, yeayes
03/08/17, 19:27 - Infected: Yes*
03/08/17, 19:27 - Tel: Need? No.. Want? Individual I guess. 

I wonder if that answer changes as you get older.. I think it is for me
03/08/17, 19:28 - Circle: Are you in a relationship tel?
03/08/17, 19:28 - Tel: Tbh that makes sense and you already kind of alluded to that. Feel like I've wasted a question.
03/08/17, 19:28 - Tel: )
03/08/17, 19:28 - Tel: Lol *
03/08/17, 19:28 - Tel: Nope
03/08/17, 19:29 - Tel: This is the longest I haven't been actually.
03/08/17, 19:29 - Infected: I am aware that I give off the vibe that I don't like anyone for any reason.
03/08/17, 19:30 - Tahnacious: Honestly while I agree that you're a little overweight if you aren't compelled to have a life partner nor compelled to live a long life I don't see any particular reason to change that. For your current needs being the way you are is fine.
03/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: Nope, didn't get that. Trying to be accurate with questions rather than asking something you've already said
03/08/17, 19:30 - Infected: It's not illogical to ask if I would participate in a relationship.
03/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: Didn't get it as in I didn't feel like that's how you came across
03/08/17, 19:31 - Infected: That's what I said.
03/08/17, 19:31 - Infected: Alright
03/08/17, 19:31 - Tel: It was more that you had already answered the question
03/08/17, 19:32 - Tahnacious: Yeah no one tells me I need to work out.  In fact when I do people often ask me why are you doing this, you're great as you are. I've even been called "twiggy" but I don't see it. I'd rather just one honest opinion saying I need to keep at it so I can be motivated to continue rather than relying on me, myself and I
03/08/17, 19:32 - Infected: Clarifying a point is rarely a bad idea.
03/08/17, 19:32 - Tel: Haha fair enough
03/08/17, 19:33 - Tahnacious: I wasn't raped and I knew self defense. I was just a lot younger and a lot smaller than my opponent, managed to wait until he let his guard down to escape though, otherwise I would've likely been murdered.
03/08/17, 19:33 - Circle: I dont think her weight has too much to do with finding a partner and i find it a little insulting that anyone would think that she should be focusing on her looks for a chance to be with a shallow ass man
03/08/17, 19:34 - Infected: It's a little unexpected in an intp group but not unexpected when you account for general human nature.
03/08/17, 19:35 - Tahnacious: I keep a dagger on me sometimes and never wear heels.
03/08/17, 19:35 - Infected: Which is why I like to poke people and observe their reactions.
03/08/17, 19:36 - Infected: I keep several weapons of different types. Mostly because I am a single mother and have the responsibility of protecting my offspring.
03/08/17, 19:37 - Tel: 😳
03/08/17, 19:37 - Circle: Ive just had a quick scroll through that convo and read a few messages im outraged at fabio n amins views , i get poking people simply to entertain yourself or get reactions but that was out of line so immature
03/08/17, 19:37 - Tel: Remind me never to cross you two..
03/08/17, 19:37 - Tahnacious: This, lol
03/08/17, 19:38 - Tahnacious: Me in a nutshell. I grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
03/08/17, 19:38 - Tel: I think society is immature tbh.. Plenty think that way of thinking is correct
03/08/17, 19:39 - Infected: Well, I was entertained.
03/08/17, 19:39 - Infected: Same, basically.
03/08/17, 19:39 - Circle: I guess ive never met anyone brave enough to actually blame the victem outloud
03/08/17, 19:40 - Infected: Echo chamber
03/08/17, 19:40 - Tel: https://youtu.be/Xw_V2kMOUgw
03/08/17, 19:40 - Tel: This is what a significant portion of society is made up of..
03/08/17, 19:40 - Tahnacious: Illegal in my country and nowhere to obtain.
03/08/17, 19:40 - Circle: 😔
03/08/17, 19:41 - Tel: Even take out the political context and make it about hillary, or Bernie, or anyone. They just spout stuff and believe it for no good reason
03/08/17, 19:42 - Tel: That's why the media is so dangerous. And ppl such as Trump. 

It legitimises this type of poor developed bs
03/08/17, 19:42 - Tel: It's unhealthy.. The election of ppl like Trump, or Brexit, is prob a sign of an unhealthy society
03/08/17, 19:43 - Infected: Politicians in general are a current sign of unhealthy society.
03/08/17, 19:43 - Circle: How do you guys quote msgs
03/08/17, 19:43 - Circle: Yes unhealthy society
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: Select the msg (click and hold with finger), then you'll see buttons up top
03/08/17, 19:44 - Circle: I enjoy reading all the conspiracy theories though🤣
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: Can't show you my finger...
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: ☝🏻
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: It looked like that
03/08/17, 19:44 - Circle: Which button is it tho
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: Tbh, I used my thumb
03/08/17, 19:44 - Tel: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 19:45 - Tel: The left one
03/08/17, 19:45 - Tel: Ish
03/08/17, 19:45 - Tel: Next to the number
03/08/17, 19:45 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 19:46 - Circle: ahhhh i got it Thank you 😘
03/08/17, 19:46 - Tel: Np! 😁
03/08/17, 19:46 - Infected: 👏🏻
03/08/17, 19:47 - Tahnacious: Ditto
03/08/17, 19:47 - Circle: Appreciate the applause
03/08/17, 19:48 - Tahnacious: I enjoyed that
03/08/17, 19:48 - Infected: So did I.
03/08/17, 19:48 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 19:49 - Circle: 😂
03/08/17, 19:51 - Tel: Just read it. Indeed enjoyable
03/08/17, 19:51 - Tahnacious: I vote this.
03/08/17, 19:51 - Infected: I would be interested.
03/08/17, 19:53 - Circle: I love that game
03/08/17, 19:53 - Circle: Have you guys ever played it in virtual reality ? Very fun
03/08/17, 19:54 - Infected: I've never played it at all
03/08/17, 19:54 - Tahnacious: Unfortunately I find the prettier the cake the worse it tastes haha
03/08/17, 19:54 - Tel: http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1AJ20F
03/08/17, 19:54 - Circle: Its very very simple but funny
03/08/17, 19:54 - Tel: Nope, not I'm VR
03/08/17, 19:54 - Tel: In*
03/08/17, 19:55 - Circle: Ahah where do you normally play?
03/08/17, 19:55 - Tel: At a friend's place; house party
03/08/17, 19:56 - Circle: ahah
03/08/17, 19:57 - Tahnacious: Relatable
03/08/17, 19:58 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I've only just read everything and caught up
03/08/17, 19:59 - Tahnacious: I do
03/08/17, 19:59 - Infected: An intp house party might be fun.
03/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it would be relatively low key I suspect which would be fairly good for my mental state
03/08/17, 20:00 - Tel: Does everyone read the info? I do, @61477394075 (at least just now) and @15015198024 seem too
03/08/17, 20:00 - Tahnacious: I managed to sleep and just woke up, haha
03/08/17, 20:00 - Tel: By info I  mean the entire chat
03/08/17, 20:00 - Tel: Yea, I figured. Hope you're feeling refreshed :)
03/08/17, 20:00 - Infected: I prefer to have an idea of what's going on.
03/08/17, 20:01 - Infected: Agreed
03/08/17, 20:01 - Tahnacious: I have
03/08/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: Finally... Yes. I got some solid hours.
03/08/17, 20:02 - Circle: I would enjoy that
03/08/17, 20:02 - Tahnacious: I feel sorry for you going through most of what happened last night.
03/08/17, 20:03 - Circle: Too many msgs i try tho
03/08/17, 20:03 - Infected: Heh.
03/08/17, 20:03 - Tel: I feel sorry for them..
03/08/17, 20:04 - Infected: I have poor short term memory. I've already forgotten it.
03/08/17, 20:04 - Tel: Lol
03/08/17, 20:04 - Tel: Methinks I need to sleep
03/08/17, 20:05 - Tel: Toodles ppl. Let me know when we can play CAH. I think that'd be fun
03/08/17, 20:05 - Tel: And D&D.
03/08/17, 20:06 - Infected: 👋🏻
03/08/17, 20:16 - Tahnacious: We will try and organise something next week, or maybe over the weekend.
03/08/17, 20:16 - Tel: 👍🏻
03/08/17, 20:17 - Infected: Sounds good
03/08/17, 20:29 - FABIO: what ias cah?
03/08/17, 20:30 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 20:30 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 20:30 - Tahnacious: Just a card game
03/08/17, 20:30 - FABIO: sounds fun
03/08/17, 20:31 - Tahnacious: It is 😁
03/08/17, 20:31 - FABIO: there is a card game me and my friends always play
03/08/17, 20:31 - FABIO: when we get together
03/08/17, 20:31 - FABIO: you have to make teams... the good. and the bad... the bad know who is bad.. the good doesnt
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: Oh yeah
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: I know the one
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: There are many variations
03/08/17, 20:32 - FABIO: it is really funny
03/08/17, 20:32 - FABIO: we are all engineers
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: But one of the more common ones is "werewolf"
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: It is just a mind game.
03/08/17, 20:32 - FABIO: so the game everytime.. ends with probability discussion
03/08/17, 20:32 - FABIO: very fun
03/08/17, 20:32 - Tahnacious: I often get away with it if I'm on the "bad team"
03/08/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: But I also get wrongly accused like 50% of the time :P
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: hahahahahahaha
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: i am the CHAOTIC player
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: i make decisions that confuses everyone
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: they hate play with me
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: hahahahah
03/08/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: Hahah
03/08/17, 20:33 - FABIO: usually they just assume im bad
03/08/17, 20:33 - Tahnacious: I can muster a decent PokerFace when required
03/08/17, 20:34 - Tahnacious: Yeah me too
03/08/17, 20:34 - FABIO: also love to play poker
03/08/17, 20:34 - FABIO: =D
03/08/17, 20:34 - Tahnacious: Until I actually am and then I mindfucj them out of it xD
03/08/17, 20:34 - Tahnacious: *mindfuck
03/08/17, 20:34 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm not great but I end up winning my money back at least
03/08/17, 20:35 - FABIO: i go for the all win
03/08/17, 20:35 - FABIO: or i get all.. or i lose my money
03/08/17, 20:35 - FABIO: =D
03/08/17, 20:35 - Tahnacious: I'm not usually a risk taker when it comes to money
03/08/17, 20:35 - FABIO: no point in saving my money
03/08/17, 20:35 - Tahnacious: In video games I always save before a gambit... Lol
03/08/17, 20:35 - Tahnacious: Because why risk it?
03/08/17, 20:35 - FABIO: ohh here we play with a fee enter... 5 BR$ and you play
03/08/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: Yeah I play usually $10 entry
03/08/17, 20:36 - FABIO: so its not much.. i like more to risky
03/08/17, 20:36 - FABIO: hahahahah
03/08/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: And after a while I get either $10-20 back
03/08/17, 20:36 - FABIO: more fun
03/08/17, 20:36 - Tahnacious: That's it
03/08/17, 20:39 - Tahnacious: I'm kind of scared of gambling really, if I ever got good at it I think I'd be denied/refused entry or hunted down or something crazy like that
03/08/17, 21:02 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
03/08/17, 21:02 - FABIO: Cs
03/08/17, 21:02 - FABIO: 🙃
03/08/17, 21:03 - Circle: Ive got a really addictive personality i so easily gey addicted so i should steer clear from gambling lol
03/08/17, 21:17 - Tahnacious: Yup
04/08/17, 00:29 - Infected: Was Life an Inevitable Outcome of Thermodynamics? http://bigthink.com/robby-berman/was-life-an-inevitable-outcome-of-thermodynamics
04/08/17, 00:29 - Infected: You guys read this yet?
04/08/17, 00:44 - Janith: Not yet. Will read now
04/08/17, 00:44 - Tahnacious: Haven't had a chance, been a busy bee
04/08/17, 00:44 - Tahnacious: Much to my disdain
04/08/17, 00:45 - Infected: I found something for you.
04/08/17, 00:45 - Infected: https://www.inc.com/mithu-storoni/what-einsteins-brain-tells-us-about-intelligence-a.html
04/08/17, 01:01 - Janith: An interesting article. The idea itself looks promising. Hopefully there will be followup experiments that shed more light on the subject
04/08/17, 01:04 - Janith: Gotta say I'm also curious about how the "God did it" crowd will try to dance around this one 😂
04/08/17, 01:07 - Infected: I look forward to reading more on this experiment as new results are shown.
04/08/17, 01:09 - Infected: The more you look at how the universe fits together and works, the less random and almost more "designed" it seems. Which is why this experiment is so fascinating. If it does go where this article hypothesized, it'll be the closest to proving intelligent design that man has come.
04/08/17, 01:10 - Infected: That does not mean there is a god nor does it mean there isn't one, though.
04/08/17, 01:10 - Tahnacious: Oooooo
04/08/17, 01:11 - Tahnacious: Left link open for later viewing
04/08/17, 01:12 - Infected: I don't want to ruin it for you but it's the most logical evidence I've encountered for going on a "diet" : p
04/08/17, 01:13 - Janith: I'm generally against assuming that we've been designed by a consciousness just because we're here and we haven't found any life that's drastically different from is yet
04/08/17, 01:14 - Janith: There could be infinite variations of the variables that made the universe existing as other universes and most of them might even harbor life. Though they obviously won't be like us
04/08/17, 01:14 - Infected: I'm not assuming one way or the other. I don't believe it's impossible but as its yet to be proven, god/gods/conscious universe is simply a theory.
04/08/17, 01:15 - Infected: An interesting one.
04/08/17, 01:16 - Janith: I know and I don't dismiss that theory either unfortunately there's no way to test something like that
04/08/17, 01:17 - Infected: That's probably why I find it so interesting.
04/08/17, 01:18 - Janith: Also there's the problem of "who created the creator"
04/08/17, 01:19 - Infected: If I believed in a sentient designer, I doubt I'd think of it in terms of current religious dictates.
04/08/17, 01:19 - Janith: I've actually toyed with the idea that our universe could be a single level in a set of universes similar to the microverse and miniverse in rick and morty but this one extending to infinity in both directions
04/08/17, 01:20 - Infected: I had the same thought when watching Men in Black.
04/08/17, 01:21 - Janith: Religion says it's an uncaused causal agent which is preposterous after their first assumption that nothing that exists can be without a cause
04/08/17, 01:22 - Infected: There is a lot about religion that contradicts itself. Abrahamic religions anyway, I haven't studied the other as much.
04/08/17, 01:23 - Janith: The problem is... It doesn't solve much. And it also creates the possibility that we're something like a car battery, with the second law of thermodynamics existing only so that the excess energy can power some higher dimensional being's car
04/08/17, 01:23 - Shaiju: What is the personality type of God would be? Schemer ? Mastermind? INTJ? Oh! God! I am lost!🙃
04/08/17, 01:24 - Janith: The ones that cap up around India are actually a little more believable than the Abrahamic variety
04/08/17, 01:25 - Infected: I wouldn't really have a problem with that, tbh. I think it would piss some people off to find out that's the meaning of life, though xd
04/08/17, 01:25 - Shaiju: Seriously?
04/08/17, 01:25 - Janith: Hinduism and Buddhism talks about cycles which does make sense but isn't testable
04/08/17, 01:26 - Infected: Reincarnation is more believable than heaven, hell, and purgatory, imo.
04/08/17, 01:26 - Janith: Me neither. Would be fun to learn that our ultimate purpose is to waste energy 😆
04/08/17, 01:27 - Infected: "You're a waste of space."

"And I'm doing that job beautifully."
04/08/17, 01:28 - Shaiju: That's generic as one would say  semitism deals with love and peace. The overall crap around Hinduism as is practised  is detestable! The core principles stand out though! Buddhism is a relatively charming one though.. :)
04/08/17, 01:29 - Infected: I always thought that pastafarianism was charming.
04/08/17, 01:29 - Janith: I think those two religions started out as intellectual philosophies about the nature of existence but eventually got wrapped up in the religious nonsense
04/08/17, 01:30 - Janith: As a pastafarian I am honored that you like my "faith" 😂
04/08/17, 01:30 - Infected: I knew I liked you for a reason.
04/08/17, 01:31 - Shaiju: Yeah..that's why I mentioned the principles stands out while the current practice is non sense! People forgot the meaning and purpose and misplaced their quest on rituals.
04/08/17, 01:31 - Janith: You guys should try reading the gospel of the flying spaghetti monster. Makes for really entertaining reading
04/08/17, 01:31 - Infected: I think that can be said of religion as a whole.
04/08/17, 01:31 - Infected: Noted
04/08/17, 01:32 - Janith: Generally when something is given to the masses it tends to get dumbed down to the point where most people who know about it have no clue what it actually is
04/08/17, 01:32 - Shaiju: Yeah... But Hinduism didn't start as a religion but as a cultural heritage. Guiding principles of life as in 'Sanathana dharma'. :)
04/08/17, 01:33 - Janith: I did not know that
04/08/17, 01:33 - Janith: Buddhism started off in a philosophical manner too right?
04/08/17, 01:34 - Shaiju: There was a feature on an experiment conducted on monkeys to study how superstitions are formed which involves banana and water pump. I forgot where I read it though. It is an eye opener!
04/08/17, 01:34 - Infected: I've heard the term but never read about it. There's just so much information to process everywhere about everything.
04/08/17, 01:35 - Janith: Oh yeah! I've read about that. Really fun experiment
04/08/17, 01:35 - Infected: That sounds familiar. Did it involve a ladder?
04/08/17, 01:35 - Janith: It's confusing, frustrating and glorious at the same time 😁
04/08/17, 01:36 - Janith: Yaaasss
04/08/17, 01:36 - Shaiju: Yep👍🏻
04/08/17, 01:36 - Infected: I love that experiment.
04/08/17, 01:36 - Shaiju: Me too....
04/08/17, 01:36 - Infected: I agree.
04/08/17, 01:37 - Janith: In that sense religion does seem to be a natural byproduct of evolution
04/08/17, 01:37 - Infected: In what sense?
04/08/17, 01:38 - Janith: We have a tendency to believe in things without really questioning them
04/08/17, 01:38 - Janith: Came to us from the primates
04/08/17, 01:39 - Janith: Nearly every religion in the world could have started out as an experiment in social control that spiraled out of control
04/08/17, 01:39 - Infected: I see your point but something about this statement sits wrong with me.
04/08/17, 01:40 - Infected: In general, that's what most religion is, a conduit for controlling the masses. It's simple and effective.
04/08/17, 01:41 - Janith: Hmm... Maybe 'evolutionary disposition' is a better term? 
Unless we really think about something we're likely to believe without questioning
04/08/17, 01:41 - Janith: Of course that's when populations are considered in general
04/08/17, 01:41 - Infected: Then I'm glad for all the poor bastards that questioned and got poisoned or burned at the stake for it.
04/08/17, 01:42 - Janith: They're the monkeys that tried to climb the ladder xD
04/08/17, 01:42 - Janith: Thanks to them we now have some bananas
04/08/17, 01:43 - Infected: So are we, in general lol
04/08/17, 01:44 - Janith: I could never understand why some people consider us being related to animals as a bad thing
04/08/17, 01:44 - Janith: Knowing everything is connected to everything else is just amazing
04/08/17, 01:44 - Infected: Everything came from somrwhere.
04/08/17, 01:44 - Infected: Somewhere.
04/08/17, 01:45 - Infected: Isn't it!
04/08/17, 01:45 - Infected: Just looking at one tree, such as the equines, and how they evolved is so amazing.
04/08/17, 01:45 - Janith: In this case we're all from the cores of dying stars!
04/08/17, 01:46 - Infected: We started out as drifting particles. How is that not fascinating?
04/08/17, 01:47 - Janith: Yes! That's actually one of the reasons I could never understand why people flocked to religion. Religious explanations lack the beauty that is reality. They're also ridiculously simplistic
04/08/17, 01:47 - Janith: Hey @15015198024 what are the specs of your pc?
04/08/17, 01:47 - Infected: Fuck all if I know. I'd have to look.
04/08/17, 01:48 - Janith: 😂
04/08/17, 01:48 - Tahnacious: This
04/08/17, 01:48 - Janith: http://spaceengine.org
04/08/17, 01:48 - Janith: See if you can run this
04/08/17, 01:48 - Janith: It's basically a 1:1 scale simulation of the universe
04/08/17, 01:49 - Janith: Takes your breath away 😍
04/08/17, 01:49 - Janith: Plus it's freeware
04/08/17, 01:49 - Infected: I've saved it for later. I have so much to look at.
04/08/17, 01:49 - Tahnacious: Before men in black and rick and Morty I'd already wondered "what if electrons and neutrons were just tiny universes or galaxies and our own universe was just a tiny part of an even bigger universe"
04/08/17, 01:50 - Infected: I like that idea. It has appeal.
04/08/17, 01:51 - Tahnacious: This
04/08/17, 01:51 - Janith: That would be beautiful
04/08/17, 01:51 - Infected: I think this conversation is actually making my mouth water 😑
04/08/17, 01:52 - Tahnacious: This, very much so
04/08/17, 01:53 - Tahnacious: Yeah I always put it down on any forms that asked for it. Also happily wear a strainer at times
04/08/17, 01:53 - Infected: I have kind of my own made up religion. I always just write down "pagan" or "other" under religion.
04/08/17, 01:56 - Janith: Out of curiosity, mind sharing some interesting points about your personal religion?
04/08/17, 01:57 - Infected: Replace "god" with the universe and "soul" with ghost particle and it might give you a vague idea. It's just something I think about.
04/08/17, 02:00 - Tahnacious: I wrote "Jedi" once
04/08/17, 02:00 - Infected: Lol I like that. I wrote down "Shamanism " a couple of times when I was younger.
04/08/17, 02:00 - Janith: I've toyed with an idea similar to the ghost particle thing.. 
Basically it's our consciousness only physically existing in some of the other spacial dimensions predicted by string theory but attached to our body via link between one of those dimensions and the dimensions we're familiar with
04/08/17, 02:01 - Infected: My concept isn't quite so complex as that. I'm a simple person ;  )
04/08/17, 02:02 - Janith: And since our consciousness can only receive information from the body that exists within these three dimensions we can only perceive a 3 dimensional universe
04/08/17, 02:02 - Infected: That makes sense.
04/08/17, 02:02 - Tahnacious: I've read this
04/08/17, 02:03 - Janith: Haha I might have got carried away while trying to make my theory compatible with the current knowledge regarding consciousness 😅
04/08/17, 02:03 - Tahnacious: Definitely wouldn't surprise me
04/08/17, 02:03 - Infected: I read an interesting article about ghost particles earlier.
04/08/17, 02:03 - Janith: They should teach that experiment in schools. To give children an idea of the effects of superstition
04/08/17, 02:04 - Janith: Ooohh show mee😁😁
04/08/17, 02:05 - Tahnacious: agreed
04/08/17, 02:06 - Infected: I think this is it. Flipboard isn't letting me access my lists.

04/08/17, 02:06 - Tahnacious: Awww cute :)
04/08/17, 02:07 - Infected: I dabbled with tarot cards at one time. I found it to be an interesting form of observation.
04/08/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: I will show my kid that before he or she enters schooling.
04/08/17, 02:07 - Tahnacious: I have a deck still from New Orleans, it is fun to play with.
04/08/17, 02:08 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:08 - Infected: Some people swore I had supernatural ability lol
04/08/17, 02:09 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:09 - Tahnacious: Nice!
04/08/17, 02:10 - Tahnacious: Hah, if you were my friend in person I'd happily sit and do readings with you
04/08/17, 02:10 - Infected: Same lol
04/08/17, 02:10 - Tahnacious: I only have one friend who is familiar with tarot, she in an INFP and she says she won't touch them anymore. Bad juujuu
04/08/17, 02:11 - Tahnacious: I'm like "pssssh"
04/08/17, 02:11 - Janith: What the heck is a juujuu😂😂
04/08/17, 02:11 - Infected: I've had a couple of "wtf" moments with it. When my predictions turn out to be correct, I'm as surprised as anyone lol
04/08/17, 02:13 - Infected: It's like a spiritual essence, I suppose. A sense of good or evil, etc.
04/08/17, 02:13 - Tahnacious: Yeah I had some creepily accurate predictions before
04/08/17, 02:14 - Tahnacious: I was shuffling randomly and two cards had fallen out, they described my situation at the time to a T
04/08/17, 02:14 - Tahnacious: I'd been shuffling for 5 mins and they just kinda popped out like "excuse me ma'am I think you were looking for us"
04/08/17, 02:15 - Infected: I told an old work friend that she would come into money. She texted me the next day and said a relative had randomly sent her a fat check. I had a momentary lapse of reason. I've had other interesting experiences with it as well. I chalk it up to subconscious logic.
04/08/17, 02:16 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:16 - Tahnacious: Yeah, that's interesting
04/08/17, 02:16 - Infected: Lovely
04/08/17, 02:16 - Janith: Aurora from upper Earth atmosphere in space Engine
04/08/17, 02:16 - Tahnacious: I find it hard to believe every crazy prediction like this comes just at random.
04/08/17, 02:17 - Janith: I spent the last half hour in a Canada-ish location staring out into space 😂
04/08/17, 02:17 - Infected: I don't think it's exactly random. I think it's a thought process that just seems magical.
04/08/17, 02:17 - Janith: Do the numbers. How many are right vs how many are wrong
04/08/17, 02:18 - Tahnacious: Probably
04/08/17, 02:18 - Infected: Observation vs likelihood of events vs common sense.
04/08/17, 02:20 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:20 - Infected: I need to write that down in my notebook.
04/08/17, 02:20 - Infected: You're getting me really interested in this simulation.
04/08/17, 02:21 - Janith: And I haven't even got to the awesome parts yet!
04/08/17, 02:21 - Janith: Still just left earth 😂
04/08/17, 02:22 - Janith: I'll head over to TRAPPIST-1 and take a few snaps
04/08/17, 02:23 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:25 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:26 - Infected: Breathtaking, really.
04/08/17, 02:28 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 02:28 - Janith: I'm in the accretion disk of Sagittarius A. Near the event horizon

04/08/17, 02:32 - Janith: Every dot there is a galaxy
04/08/17, 02:32 - Janith: I've spent days in this simulation and it never fails to take my breath away
04/08/17, 02:35 - Infected: I'm probably going to become obsessed with that.

04/08/17, 03:26 - Tel: Indeed. I would equate it to a scientist + petri dish scenario.
04/08/17, 03:26 - Infected: It seems like an elaborate experiment, doesn't it?
04/08/17, 03:28 - Tel: Lol are you talking about what I think you're talking about.. Let me find pic

04/08/17, 03:32 - Infected: Lulz
04/08/17, 03:35 - Tel: Yup, I use this as a compromise with religious folk when debating.
04/08/17, 03:39 - Infected: I suppose that works.
04/08/17, 04:15 - Circle: Ive had similar experiences, most of the time though my predictions wer just in jest but still turned out to be true .
04/08/17, 04:23 - Circle: @447903370497 thankyou for adding that picture i think it will help me so much in some of the debates i have, im hoping other personality types easily grasp this concept now
04/08/17, 04:26 - Tel: Yes hopefully! I find that repetition helps
04/08/17, 04:27 - Tel: Ppl have a tendency to forget that which doesn't fit nicely into the world they've created
04/08/17, 04:27 - Tel: Like Amin previously, they'll just divert the convo instead of thinking it through. Much easier
04/08/17, 04:28 - Circle: Hahah your right !

I guess America is full too.
04/08/17, 04:59 - Circle: I still cant believe he got elected
04/08/17, 05:06 - Tel: That plus Brexit. Go figure
04/08/17, 05:09 - Circle: I guess the general population is upset i dont blame them for being upset and angry with how things are currently , back in the day one member of the family would work and take care of the rest but now the lower and working class have no hope
04/08/17, 05:24 - Tel: Yea. I dislike how the system is set up presently too, but I still don't cut my nose off to spite my face
04/08/17, 05:25 - Tel: It's weird how the demographics voting for and against Brexit were aligned. Poor, ill educated and old against vs young, educated middle class being the starkest
04/08/17, 05:26 - Tel: Esp when the (?)only section of society to likely benefit from Brexit were the ppl who voted against it, realising how bad it'd be for the country plus everyone else
04/08/17, 05:26 - Tel: Likely not only.. But one of the main ones anyway
04/08/17, 05:26 - Tel: The - leftie luvvies or whatever we're called these days when they feel they've used the 'remoaner' phrase too much (which is quite infrequent indeed)
04/08/17, 05:27 - Tel: Trump.. Geez. That's even more insane I think
04/08/17, 05:28 - Tel: Just goes to show that Tony Blair was right.. At least in one thing - 'education, education, education'
04/08/17, 06:09 - Circle: Its very sad indeed but i cant help being a little happy that the house prices are going down seeing as i would like to buy soon 😂
04/08/17, 06:11 - Tel: haha yea I guess. It does also help out ppl wanting to buy a 2nd property though
04/08/17, 06:11 - Tel: Plus, prices will go back up when they realise demand has also fallen
04/08/17, 06:12 - Tel: On a personal note though.. good luck!
04/08/17, 06:15 - Circle: Thankyou haha

04/08/17, 10:01 - Circle: Ok maybe he didnt find it interesting enough . What would you have liked him to reply to that? Did you want to discuss the article ?
04/08/17, 10:03 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: We used to talk a lot after one of us said hi by sending something, like he commented my status

04/08/17, 10:08 - Circle: Maybe you should ignore him take some space for a while if he does like you he will get back to you and if he doesnt care then you can stop wasting your time with him
04/08/17, 10:08 - Circle: Haha yeah it happens
04/08/17, 10:08 - Spaceexplorer: Ive no idea what youll talk about

04/08/17, 10:12 - Circle: Oh haha
04/08/17, 10:12 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Wasting time with him 🤒
You right, Im just afraid how to face it
04/08/17, 10:13 - Circle: Well i guess technically the possibility of life on other planets is very high considering the size of space
04/08/17, 10:14 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Im now start to think that the earth is flat
04/08/17, 10:14 - Spaceexplorer: Hehe

04/08/17, 10:18 - Circle: Mr explorer is a man he might have some better advice
04/08/17, 10:18 - Spaceexplorer: Im starting to doubt the 'was' in 'was a dumb girl'
04/08/17, 10:19 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Thank you
04/08/17, 10:19 - Tel: if the universe is infinitely big, then the chances of aliens is infinitely large

04/08/17, 10:20 - Circle: Of course
04/08/17, 10:20 - Spaceexplorer: True...

Do you live in Mars alone all this time? 😛😛😛
04/08/17, 10:22 - Spaceexplorer: It can be argued
04/08/17, 10:22 - Circle: What do you feel when your in love ?
04/08/17, 10:22 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I dont care 😛
04/08/17, 10:22 - Spaceexplorer: 😎
04/08/17, 10:23 - Circle: I would love to hear an intp who has felt love give a description of what it feels like
04/08/17, 10:23 - Spaceexplorer: That would be awesome
04/08/17, 10:24 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Im feeling like I want to shout at him right in front of his face: I love you!
But all I do is stay silent
04/08/17, 10:24 - Circle: I dont know if you read some of yesterdays chat but i think i made it clear that i dont believe in "love"
04/08/17, 10:25 - Circle: So i would love to hear what it actually is
04/08/17, 10:25 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I didnt read anything
04/08/17, 10:25 - Spaceexplorer: That makes alot of sense...
04/08/17, 10:25 - Spaceexplorer: Have you thought of procreating...
04/08/17, 10:26 - Spaceexplorer: Mutant children
04/08/17, 10:26 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: 😂
04/08/17, 10:26 - Circle: Haha
04/08/17, 10:27 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: How can you do that to your own children? To a human being? 🤣
04/08/17, 10:27 - Circle: But i am serious i was expecting a less feely reply to what is love from an intp
04/08/17, 10:27 - Spaceexplorer: I want a child with 6 legs and two heads...
04/08/17, 10:28 - Circle: Can you give me a little more information of why or how you love or feel that way
04/08/17, 10:28 - Spaceexplorer: Maybe four hands
04/08/17, 10:28 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Thats what actually happen to me. 
I want to spend my whole time with him. I just can not say a thing, such thing to him
04/08/17, 10:29 - Circle: I have the perfect match for you
04/08/17, 10:29 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I dont know. It happened just like that, Hina
04/08/17, 10:29 - Spaceexplorer: ...
04/08/17, 10:30 - Circle: You just woke up on day with hearts floating around you ?
04/08/17, 10:30 - Circle: Ganesha
04/08/17, 10:31 - Spaceexplorer: Interesting
04/08/17, 10:31 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Yeah. Something like that.
And start to think of him all the time. Endless
04/08/17, 10:31 - Circle: But your children mighg carry the elephant gene ☺
04/08/17, 10:31 - Spaceexplorer: Hindu god
04/08/17, 10:32 - Spaceexplorer: 😂😎
04/08/17, 10:32 - Circle: @6285875702119 out of curiosity when did you first realise you are an intp
04/08/17, 10:33 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Just like the explorer wants: mutant
04/08/17, 10:33 - Circle: Yep
04/08/17, 10:33 - Spaceexplorer: Space explorer....
04/08/17, 10:33 - Spaceexplorer: I never knew you  were soooo dumb....
04/08/17, 10:34 - Spaceexplorer: Not just explorer
04/08/17, 10:34 - Spaceexplorer: Its space
04/08/17, 10:34 - Spaceexplorer: Space
04/08/17, 10:34 - Spaceexplorer: SPACE
04/08/17, 10:34 - Spaceexplorer: SPACE
04/08/17, 10:34 - Circle: Ahahaha you touched a nerve hes having a breakdown
04/08/17, 10:35 - Spaceexplorer: Finally some comfort...
04/08/17, 10:35 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Ive done mbti test twice and the result was always the same: intp. Me myself didnt really believe it. But all of the characteristics described me.
I love to be alone, reading, loving science,
04/08/17, 10:35 - Circle: Yes ive been well known to offer emotional support
04/08/17, 10:36 - Spaceexplorer: Appreciated....😎😘
04/08/17, 10:36 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: 😊☺😛
04/08/17, 10:37 - Circle: Does the guy you love like reading being alone and science ?
04/08/17, 10:37 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: What kind of space do you actually exploring anyway 😏
Why are you trying so hard to be called space explorer 😛
04/08/17, 10:38 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: He is an enfj. But he's totally smart
04/08/17, 10:38 - Spaceexplorer: Aint it simple.... Space explorer
04/08/17, 10:38 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Whatever 🤗
04/08/17, 10:39 - Circle: But does he like similar things to you does he like reading science and being alone?
04/08/17, 10:39 - Spaceexplorer: So.... "is a dumb girl"....
What do you mean by "whatever"?
04/08/17, 10:39 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: He loves science but loves to be with people
04/08/17, 10:40 - Circle: Ok so other then his extrovertedness he is similar to you
04/08/17, 10:40 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Your super nickname
04/08/17, 10:40 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I think so
04/08/17, 10:40 - Spaceexplorer: I SAID SPACE EXPLORER
04/08/17, 10:41 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Thats why we talked together a lot
04/08/17, 10:41 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: Okay...
04/08/17, 10:43 - Circle: Have you ever gotten a result that isnt intp ? Although i have no doubt you may be smart is it not possible you are not intp ? Im sure there must be other personalitys that love reading science and being alone
04/08/17, 10:44 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I ve done it twice and the results were both intp 😭
04/08/17, 10:45 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I know Im too emotional for an intp
04/08/17, 10:46 - Circle: I used to have a friend who always got intp results too when she didnt know enough about herself but as soon as she was more self aware her results changed . Shes a lovely bright intelligent woman
04/08/17, 10:48 - Circle: also im not an expert in this just my thoughts so take what i say with a grain of salt
04/08/17, 11:04 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: I was hoping to be an infp, but it still the same. The result is intp again 😪
I believe Im self aware
04/08/17, 11:05 - ‪+62 858-7570-2119‬: So this was the third time, Hina
04/08/17, 11:10 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: I believe in love. I believe the concept exist and everyone is capable of loving. Although it is much more difficult to describe love.
04/08/17, 11:11 - Spaceexplorer: I deny its existence....
04/08/17, 11:11 - Tel: The result doesn't change because you do.. the result can only change because you're answering it differently.

The MBTI is an indicator, not a test. The results are not conclusive - they merely reflect back to you how you have tended to answer the questions it contains.

The only conclusive way to know what type you are is to understand the dichotomies very well, understand the functions very well, and to be self-aware. Alternatively, you can go through it with an MBTI practitioner, who will supplement your knowledge with their own, guiding you through the process.. but, again, only you can determine your own MBTI.
04/08/17, 11:12 - Tel: re this
04/08/17, 11:12 - Tel: Re love.. good Q.
04/08/17, 11:12 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Love is more than a feeling. It is a decision of wanting the best for those around you. Sometimes love is not nice. Because true love disciplines, true love is honest. True love trusts.... And the list goes on.
04/08/17, 11:12 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Why?
04/08/17, 11:13 - Spaceexplorer: Its over rated
04/08/17, 11:13 - Spaceexplorer: I love my cat....
04/08/17, 11:13 - Tel: The thing I hate about partners is that I will feel a lot for them, and then will 'find them out'; as in I'll come to dislike certain elements. I think I'm looking for a perfection that doesn't exist.
04/08/17, 11:13 - Spaceexplorer: And my baby toe....
04/08/17, 11:13 - Spaceexplorer: Does it mean anything?
04/08/17, 11:14 - Tel: lol. You love your baby toe? That's random. Ask an astrologist..
04/08/17, 11:15 - Spaceexplorer: I still have the guts to chop it off......
What happened to all that love?
04/08/17, 11:15 - Spaceexplorer: And kill my cat....
04/08/17, 11:16 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Why would kill your cat if you truely love it?
04/08/17, 11:16 - Spaceexplorer: To find out what is love?..
04/08/17, 11:17 - Circle: True
04/08/17, 11:18 - Circle: So far the descriptions of love i hear all sound like attachment
04/08/17, 11:19 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: So you'll find out what love is by experimenting with what it is not?
04/08/17, 11:19 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Love is placing the other person's interests above your own, without losing yourself the way they fell in love with you, yet remaining firm enough not to lose yourself in them.
04/08/17, 11:19 - Spaceexplorer: Starting to make sense
04/08/17, 11:19 - Spaceexplorer: Thats too much of jargon..
04/08/17, 11:20 - Circle: i think tel explained it perfectly, he is better spoken than i
04/08/17, 11:22 - Circle: 🤢
04/08/17, 11:22 - Circle: 🤢🤢🤢
04/08/17, 11:24 - Circle: Love is the nut inside the shell love is the glow from the sun love the endless sound of waves crashing on to the coast of our mind and soul 🤢🤢🤣🤣🤣
04/08/17, 11:25 - Spaceexplorer: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
04/08/17, 11:25 - Circle: Love is the endless*

04/08/17, 11:25 - Circle: 😂
04/08/17, 11:25 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: How would you guys describe the concept of freedom?
04/08/17, 11:27 - Circle: I guess i would say its not having physical or mental restraint forced upon you by others
04/08/17, 11:27 - Spaceexplorer: 👍
04/08/17, 11:28 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Ok and how about restraints forced upon you by your own body?
04/08/17, 11:28 - Spaceexplorer: Are you free to remove it?
04/08/17, 11:29 - Circle: For example?°
04/08/17, 11:30 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Habits... Addiction... Impairments...
04/08/17, 11:30 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Involuntary actions
04/08/17, 11:30 - Circle: Do you mean mental disorders?
04/08/17, 11:31 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Freedom and nature https://g.co/kgs/QMwkRN
04/08/17, 11:32 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Not only mental disorders. For example drug addiction. When a person is addicted to drugs, are they free to choose not to use drugs? Or do they feel enslaved to their body's cravings?
04/08/17, 11:32 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Btw English is my second language, so I apologize for bad grammar 🙈
04/08/17, 11:32 - Spaceexplorer: Create an ai that voluntarily drowns you in a bucket of milk....
04/08/17, 11:33 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Lol
04/08/17, 11:33 - Circle: Addicts have placed chains on their own freedom . They chose actions that had consequences its simple really
04/08/17, 11:33 - Tel: English is my second too
04/08/17, 11:34 - Circle: In this sense the drug itself was the chain
04/08/17, 11:35 - Circle: Mine too
04/08/17, 11:35 - Spaceexplorer: True
04/08/17, 11:35 - Spaceexplorer: So the ai would also be the chain?
04/08/17, 11:36 - Spaceexplorer: Even though you created it?
04/08/17, 11:36 - Circle: No the AI is the liberator
04/08/17, 11:37 - Spaceexplorer: <Mídia omitida>

04/08/17, 11:58 - Tel: "the worst thing that came out of the 20thC"

04/08/17, 11:59 - Circle: 😏
04/08/17, 12:00 - Janith: It's true but love is like changing a baby's diapers for most NTs. Unless you're a party that's directly involved in it you're gonna find it a little gross 😂

04/08/17, 12:00 - Janith: PhD in?

04/08/17, 12:03 - Didier: Janith,Janith 😂
04/08/17, 12:03 - Didier: Maybe because she knows love?

04/08/17, 12:04 - Didier: Intp and isfj,not impossible but,I can't imagine what happens

04/08/17, 12:05 - Didier: And how do u connect?
04/08/17, 12:06 - Didier: ISFJs are definitely more sociable,aren't they?

04/08/17, 12:08 - Didier: Yup,but my brother is still and we can still connect,so that's a relief
04/08/17, 12:08 - Didier: Age is a factor,but not the biggest

04/08/17, 12:09 - Didier: Oh god Janith 😂
04/08/17, 12:09 - Didier: That's only if we r a simulation

04/08/17, 12:12 - Circle: Teaching sounds fun as long as its not small children
04/08/17, 12:12 - Didier: 😆
04/08/17, 12:12 - Didier: I think it depends on the class
04/08/17, 12:12 - Didier: U know in Singapore?
04/08/17, 12:13 - Didier: We have the Express stream,Normal Academic stream,Normal Technical stream
04/08/17, 12:13 - Didier: From scoring the best to scoring the worst
04/08/17, 12:14 - Didier: I was in the express stream but I dropped to the Normal Academic stream (because family matters and stuff)
04/08/17, 12:14 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: No I am teaching at university. I'm teaching pre-service teachers...
04/08/17, 12:14 - Didier: But I found that I liked the people in NA stream better
04/08/17, 12:14 - Circle: I wonder if the teachers get to choose what stream
04/08/17, 12:14 - Didier: And I actually found them to be more smart than the girls in express
04/08/17, 12:14 - Circle: Thats amazing well done
04/08/17, 12:14 - Didier: No,but they can decide whether to let the student stay in the stream if they score badly or dropped
04/08/17, 12:15 - Didier: And this particular teacher despised me
04/08/17, 12:15 - Didier: So u know what happened
04/08/17, 12:15 - Didier: Ironic,isn't it?
04/08/17, 12:15 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Thanks🤓
04/08/17, 12:16 - Didier: I realised that score is not a test of how smart u are
04/08/17, 12:16 - Circle: I used to have a lot of trouble with teachers they always wanted to catch me out and would pick on me because they hated that i didnt study
04/08/17, 12:16 - Didier: It can depend on how diligent u r,or whether u r in a healthy mental state at that time
04/08/17, 12:16 - Tel: This
04/08/17, 12:16 - Didier: I noticed that everyone has something they r good or bad in
04/08/17, 12:17 - Didier: Then they can specialise in different things.Why look down on people for no reason?The more we need to encourage them
04/08/17, 12:17 - Didier: Same...It's annoying tbh
04/08/17, 12:17 - Circle: Yeah i agree if everyone was the same society wouldnt work so we need these people
04/08/17, 12:18 - Didier: Yup haha
04/08/17, 12:18 - Didier: Imagine if we didn't have waitresses,chefs or janitors,sweepers
04/08/17, 12:18 - Didier: What would this world become?
04/08/17, 12:18 - Didier: That's why people have different roles
04/08/17, 12:19 - Didier: I find it stupid,no,even ridiculous to place people in different streams (according to how well they score)
04/08/17, 12:19 - Didier: Because the Normal Technical stream,everyone looks down on them here
04/08/17, 12:20 - Didier: They are thought to be doomed for life,no future,going to the worst school
04/08/17, 12:20 - Didier: But I know a few people there.I find them even better than people in "better" streams
04/08/17, 12:20 - Circle: Thats a shame
04/08/17, 12:21 - Didier: Though there are really people who are hopeless there.But it's because society didn't give them what they need.Encouragement,support
04/08/17, 12:21 - Tel: More efficient. I know so many ppl in 'low' positions who are massively under utilised. Get the robots in already. Free up that cognition.
04/08/17, 12:21 - Didier: But there are many people who are awesome there
04/08/17, 12:21 - Didier: I feel so bad for them
04/08/17, 12:21 - Didier: Because they are really looked down upon,having no chance to shine
04/08/17, 12:22 - Didier: How can u expect them to shine,when they r not given the chance tom
04/08/17, 12:22 - Didier: ?*
04/08/17, 12:22 - Circle: There would be an uprising like the luddites
04/08/17, 12:23 - Didier: Yeah,but not everyone
04/08/17, 12:23 - Didier: Many people in high positions wouldn't even wanna do the job
04/08/17, 12:23 - Didier: But if in the future,we have good robots that can work,then maybe
04/08/17, 12:23 - Didier: I see what u mean
04/08/17, 12:24 - Didier: But what I mean is we each have something we're good at
04/08/17, 12:24 - Circle: the uk also has lower middle and higher sets . I dont know if its the same for you but the lower sets dont even have the chance to get above a c grade because their test paper doesnt test above c
04/08/17, 12:24 - Didier: Like many people I know are good at customer service,meaning having to deal with the complaints of customers
04/08/17, 12:25 - Didier: It's a bit different here,but not that different I guess
04/08/17, 12:25 - Didier: But yes,same concept
04/08/17, 12:25 - Tel: Hm, it's hard to not just say 'and?' to that. Society overall will be better off.
04/08/17, 12:26 - Circle: Do you mean society should have vigorous personality tests to see which group you are suited with like the movie allegiance?
04/08/17, 12:26 - Didier: Who knows 😆
04/08/17, 12:26 - Didier: I know u want them gone lol
04/08/17, 12:26 - Didier: movie allegiance?
04/08/17, 12:27 - Didier: Something like that
04/08/17, 12:27 - Tel: I'm in a relatively snr role and I wouldn't wanna go back to working as a cashier because it's not as fulfilling for me. I don't care about the position, but I do care about the intellectual stimuli
04/08/17, 12:27 - Didier: Never watched that movie so
04/08/17, 12:27 - Circle: Sorrt its called allegiant
04/08/17, 12:27 - Didier: Not necessarily personality tests
04/08/17, 12:27 - Tel: Not so much about want (but yea, I guess I do).. It's more about liberating ppl from mundane
04/08/17, 12:27 - Didier: But find out what they r good in,let them find out themselves
04/08/17, 12:27 - Didier: Give them a chance
04/08/17, 12:28 - Tel: (nice segue back to freedom..!)
04/08/17, 12:28 - Circle: I completly agree with you i find it so difficult to enjoy work because its just not stimulating enough yet im too lazy to do anything about it
04/08/17, 12:28 - Didier: I get what u mean.It's boring isn't it 😂
04/08/17, 12:29 - Tel: Yup! It really is!
04/08/17, 12:29 - Tel: I get the need for now though
04/08/17, 12:30 - Circle: @6582280971 you should watch allegiant it suits your age range
04/08/17, 12:30 - Didier: I think I was ranting because I felt bad for the "people who can't do well"(Normal technical stream)
04/08/17, 12:30 - Tel: Snr positions will come under threat from AI too. I'm thinking of retaining into something cyber related to future proof myself.. I have the same issue as Hina re motivation though!)
04/08/17, 12:30 - Tel: Lol"
04/08/17, 12:30 - Didier: No,not just felt bad.What do u call it
04/08/17, 12:30 - Didier: I really worry for them and our society
04/08/17, 12:31 - Tel: Hm, what part makes you feel bad though? Inability or societal judgement?
04/08/17, 12:31 - Didier: And this is when I tell myself,I should become something big,president or something
04/08/17, 12:31 - Didier: Someone who can change this
04/08/17, 12:31 - Didier: For the better
04/08/17, 12:31 - Tel: This. Totally this.
04/08/17, 12:31 - Didier: I'll check it out 😃
04/08/17, 12:31 - Circle: If i had the motivation i would go into medicine . Drs will always be needed
04/08/17, 12:31 - Tel: That's why I'm coming the greasy pole. I wanna effect that type of change.
04/08/17, 12:32 - Tel: Even surgery is becoming roboticised...
04/08/17, 12:32 - Didier: I like both doctors and cyber related jobs.Can't decide
04/08/17, 12:33 - Didier: Yep,but currently,it still needs to be controlled by people right?I know bc I watched this show
04/08/17, 12:33 - Circle: Where lifes are concerned someone will always need to watch over the robots
04/08/17, 12:33 - Didier: But in Singapore,I don't think we've ever had the chance to have a female president
04/08/17, 12:33 - Didier: It's important that we have presidents both female and male
04/08/17, 12:34 - Didier: I will change that history if I can
04/08/17, 12:34 - Didier: I just have problems with speaking
04/08/17, 12:34 - Circle: Aww i miss being young enough to have dreams
04/08/17, 12:34 - Didier: It's nerve-wrecking and I can't express myself the way I want to

04/08/17, 12:35 - Didier: Difficult business
04/08/17, 12:35 - Circle: Practice makes perfect, when i was younger i faked my life through school and college pretending to be an entp
04/08/17, 12:36 - Didier: Hmm
04/08/17, 12:37 - Didier: Yeah I will practise more often,I should 😠
04/08/17, 12:37 - Tel: At the end of the day, it's algorithmic and learned. Computers will be better than Drs soon
04/08/17, 12:37 - Didier: What do u mean by inability though?
04/08/17, 12:37 - Didier: U mean sympathy?
04/08/17, 12:37 - Didier: I don't think it's mere sympathy
04/08/17, 12:37 - Didier: U can say,empathy and societal judgement
04/08/17, 12:38 - Circle: Computers are better than drs now but i just mean in the case of robot breaking mid surgery
04/08/17, 12:38 - Didier: More like shutting down 😂
04/08/17, 12:39 - Didier: That's why it's painful to watch

How many times do you get annoyed each day and perform less well?
04/08/17, 12:39 - Didier: Thinking that I can't do anything to change it for now
04/08/17, 12:39 - Tel: Robots are more reliable once the tech has been around for a while
04/08/17, 12:39 - Circle: Lol imagine ringing the helpline halfwsy through surgery and they tell you please try rebooting the robot then call us back
04/08/17, 12:40 - Didier: Yeah I'm imagining it now 😂

04/08/17, 12:40 - Circle: What purpose will we serve once ai is complete
04/08/17, 12:40 - Didier: The question is
04/08/17, 12:41 - Didier: When will it be complete?

04/08/17, 12:43 - Circle: I know i watch alot of things thats mostly what i do at work 😂
04/08/17, 12:43 - Infected: I'll be more interested in a.i. when it steps past the boundaries of repetitive tasks.
04/08/17, 12:43 - Didier: But Hina,allegiant sounds familiar.Is it related to the Divergent series?
04/08/17, 12:44 - Didier: What series is that?
04/08/17, 12:44 - Circle: Yes i think your right i think thats what it was called
04/08/17, 12:44 - Didier: But never watched it
04/08/17, 12:44 - Didier: Okay
04/08/17, 12:45 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 12:45 - Didier: Same.It seems like it'll be fun
04/08/17, 12:45 - Circle: Its not amazing but i love watching shows with alternate society's like snow piercer hunger games etc
04/08/17, 12:45 - Didier: Yes I do love them too!
04/08/17, 12:45 - Didier: Okay I will watch it then
04/08/17, 12:45 - Infected: I found them somewhat refreshing, at first.
04/08/17, 12:46 - Didier: Love dystopian shows
04/08/17, 12:46 - Circle: Dystopian society 😍😍
04/08/17, 12:46 - Circle: Me too . Now i know what love is
04/08/17, 12:46 - Circle: And now ?
04/08/17, 12:47 - Tel: Idano. Did they envisage the industries we have when they brought out tractors and displaced almost the entire workforce?
04/08/17, 12:47 - Infected: They're becoming too much.
04/08/17, 12:47 - Didier: It seems like the movie series hasn't ended?
04/08/17, 12:47 - Circle: I love books like that too eg george orwells 1984 . Its just relaxing
04/08/17, 12:48 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 12:48 - Didier: When it came out,it was popular but I didn't give it a look.Now I will
04/08/17, 12:48 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 12:48 - Circle: I may have read the books i cant remember but i do remember they tested all the people to put them into groups they belong in
04/08/17, 12:49 - Didier: It's in my readlist!
04/08/17, 12:49 - Infected: Ferenheit 451.
04/08/17, 12:49 - Didier: Yes!!
04/08/17, 12:49 - Circle: Your awesome infected
04/08/17, 12:50 - Infected: Live free or Die isn't exactly about a dystopian society but I recommend it as a book.
04/08/17, 12:50 - Circle: Was that the one they burn all the books in
04/08/17, 12:50 - Didier: Btw when u brought it up,what I meant wasn't to have tests but to allow them to pick for themselves
04/08/17, 12:50 - Didier: So I'm all good 😂
04/08/17, 12:51 - Circle: Noted 😃
04/08/17, 12:51 - Didier: I agree
04/08/17, 12:51 - Infected: Yes. I read it at a young age and it somewhat fueled my general distaste for censorship.
04/08/17, 12:51 - Infected: By John Ringo.
04/08/17, 12:51 - Infected: I believe. Let me check.
04/08/17, 12:52 - Didier: This is getting interesting
04/08/17, 12:52 - Circle: Ahah i see but ive noticed alot of people choose things they are not good at . And then of course we would have the problem of no janitors
04/08/17, 12:52 - Didier: Wanna check them all out now 😭
04/08/17, 12:53 - Didier: Yeah that's why give them time,not let them pick at a young age.Allow others to tell them what they r good at
04/08/17, 12:53 - Circle: Me too . I feel like political correctness is now censorship too
04/08/17, 12:53 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 12:53 - Didier: I think the no janitors problem can be solved
04/08/17, 12:54 - Infected: Same. Political correctness is somewhat akin to cowardice, imo.
04/08/17, 12:54 - Circle: Your right we should get to pick at 25
04/08/17, 12:54 - Didier: Yes it is.Censorship is annoying,because it's abused by political figures as well
04/08/17, 12:54 - Infected: Roombas.
04/08/17, 12:55 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 12:55 - Didier: I like ur answer haha
04/08/17, 12:55 - Circle: Roooombaaaas🤗
04/08/17, 12:55 - Didier: Never had one though 😫
04/08/17, 12:56 - Infected: I like them. Especially when googly eyes are utiluzed.
04/08/17, 12:56 - Circle: Cant afford it 😩
04/08/17, 12:56 - Didier: U have them?
04/08/17, 12:56 - Infected: They have cheaper versions.
04/08/17, 12:56 - Infected: No, never had one. Planning on it, though.
04/08/17, 12:56 - Didier: The title sounds good
04/08/17, 12:56 - Infected: I look at robot companions a lot.
04/08/17, 12:57 - Circle: Apperantly they are just not as good my friend has the i robot roomba and says theres nothing like it
04/08/17, 12:57 - Didier: 😂It seems fun
04/08/17, 12:57 - Didier: Google eyes and all
04/08/17, 12:58 - Infected: I think in some cases, such as the roomba, the name brand is probably best.
04/08/17, 12:58 - Circle: Im acctually dissapointed with how slowly its progressing
04/08/17, 12:58 - Didier: What?
04/08/17, 12:58 - Circle: Robotics
04/08/17, 12:59 - Didier: Oh yeah u're right
04/08/17, 12:59 - Circle: By now we should have robots in our house to cook and clean 😂
04/08/17, 12:59 - Didier: I'm disappointed too
04/08/17, 12:59 - Infected: Kind of want this, even though household robots aren't quite at a satisfactory level yet.

04/08/17, 13:00 - Didier: But nothing can replace my mother's cooking tbh 😪
04/08/17, 13:00 - Infected: They can definitely do more in the area of smart homes/ household robots (domestic robotics)
04/08/17, 13:00 - Didier: But it's a good idea when she doesn't cook and I'm lazy
04/08/17, 13:01 - Circle: http://www.personasynthetics.com/productrecall/ 

I was severly dissapointed when i realised this wasnt real
04/08/17, 13:01 - Infected: What about a robot that observes your mother and cooks her recipes exactly as she does? Interesting.
04/08/17, 13:01 - Didier: That's so cute!Does it actually work?
04/08/17, 13:01 - Didier: Now I have 5 things to check out 😂
04/08/17, 13:01 - Circle: Imagine
04/08/17, 13:02 - Didier: Interesting yeah.
04/08/17, 13:02 - Infected: I don't know. You can pre-order one right now. They're due out later this year.
04/08/17, 13:02 - Didier: This means that the robot will need to observe for a longer time
04/08/17, 13:02 - Didier: To make it the most accuraye
04/08/17, 13:03 - Didier: Though I don't think the robot can do it 100% accurate
04/08/17, 13:03 - Didier: If not it's like looking into her brain haha
04/08/17, 13:03 - Infected: The current trend is to keep home robots cute and nonthreatening, which makes them less functional, imo.
04/08/17, 13:03 - Didier: Oh yeah I noticed that lol...
04/08/17, 13:04 - Circle: They dont want to cause people a fear of an ai uprising
04/08/17, 13:04 - Didier: People are scared of the unconventional
04/08/17, 13:04 - Circle: Cute robots are way less threatning
04/08/17, 13:04 - Infected: I think a robot would be capable of observing someone and reconstructing a recipe exactly as someone made it. I.e. they could measure exactly how much a person's idea of a "pinch" of salt is, etc.
04/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: If not they's lose their business.But I can't wait for robots to become more complicated
04/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: Just that,I don't want dolls
04/08/17, 13:05 - Infected: Same.
04/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: Anything other than that
04/08/17, 13:05 - Didier: 😅
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: It seems really fun
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: Like how I see it in shows
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: Howl'd Moving castle too?
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: The moving castle is cool
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: If u knoe what I'm talkimg about
04/08/17, 13:06 - Didier: Howl's*
04/08/17, 13:07 - Infected: I love Hiyao Miyazaki movies.
04/08/17, 13:08 - Didier: And I can imagine human-like sex dolls in the future...They are able to move.Then people will have dolls that look like people they like.Creepy business.
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: Yeah,they are so awesome.Music,story...
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: I love them all
04/08/17, 13:09 - Infected: I wouldn't mind a "sex doll" robot but I would like for it to have capabilities beyond the visceral
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: Like inputing the voice of a person u like 😂
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: As long as the person is willing to record that
04/08/17, 13:09 - Infected: I don't like anyone.
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: Then it will be able to talk
04/08/17, 13:09 - Didier: Talk like that person
04/08/17, 13:10 - Didier: I mean it's scary if u imagine it
04/08/17, 13:10 - Didier: Someone having a doll that looks like u
04/08/17, 13:10 - Infected: A standard edition voice picked from a collection would be fine.
04/08/17, 13:10 - Didier: And use it for their own purposes
04/08/17, 13:10 - Infected: You can already buy dolls that look like people. It's not exacr, but you choose the aesthetics.
04/08/17, 13:11 - Infected: Exact.
04/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: 😂yeah
04/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: But when it gets more popular,
04/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: People will think of weird ideas
04/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: I wonder what this society will become then
04/08/17, 13:11 - Didier: When I'm gone
04/08/17, 13:11 - Infected: It'll get worse.
04/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: It's interesting yet sad to watch 😂
04/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: Bye,talk to u next time :)
04/08/17, 13:12 - Infected: 👋🏻
04/08/17, 13:12 - Didier: 👋🏻😄
04/08/17, 13:14 - Didier: Btw,if u can appreciate Hayao Miyazaki's,you definitely have feelings no?It may not be as intense as others',but it's definitely them
04/08/17, 13:14 - Didier: there*
04/08/17, 13:15 - Didier: So I feel like u don't need to worry about it if u do
04/08/17, 13:16 - Infected: I have a more developed scope of emotional processing than a standard intp, from what I understand.
04/08/17, 13:17 - Infected: INTP's are definitely capable of emotion. They simply don't know how to process it.
04/08/17, 13:17 - Didier: True,I notice that
04/08/17, 13:17 - Didier: That's why I like u all
04/08/17, 13:18 - Didier: Though y'all might be confused with emotions at times
04/08/17, 13:18 - Didier: :) 👋🏻
04/08/17, 13:18 - Infected: Emotions are an interesting concept. 👋🏻
04/08/17, 13:19 - Didier: 😄 definitely
04/08/17, 13:28 - Circle: What did you mean by beyond the visceral
04/08/17, 13:39 - Infected: Base sexual ability.
04/08/17, 13:40 - Circle: Still confused 🙄
04/08/17, 13:40 - Circle: What did you want the robot to do for you woman LOL
04/08/17, 13:41 - Circle: I mean did you mean kinky things or like
04/08/17, 13:41 - Infected: Oh, that. I thought your question was "what did I mean by visceral"
04/08/17, 13:41 - Circle: Robo should be skilled
04/08/17, 13:42 - Infected: No. I would like a robot companion capable of conversation and learning new concepts. Beyond the standard input of responses, I would like one that can adapt to new behaviors and modes of thought.
04/08/17, 13:43 - Circle: Ahhhh i see !! You want a humam robot 😃😀
04/08/17, 13:43 - Circle: Human*
04/08/17, 13:43 - Infected: Basically.
04/08/17, 13:44 - Infected: I was really fascinated with Furbys when they first came out.
04/08/17, 13:44 - Circle: Ye i get you to be honest
04/08/17, 13:44 - Circle: I want a robo friend 🤔
04/08/17, 13:45 - Circle: Yes i loved my furbee but i preferred my poochi
04/08/17, 13:45 - Infected: I still have a furby, it's in my kitchen cabinet.
04/08/17, 13:45 - Circle: Furbees looked a bit too creepy for my liking
04/08/17, 13:46 - Infected: I always loved the gremlins movie. They are cute to me. I did prefer the first edition model.
04/08/17, 13:47 - Circle: Unrelated question . How do you raise your child... i mean as an intp . Personally i fear having children because i think id be a terrible mother expecting so much off them not allowing it to be a child i guess ... and then theres the emotional support
04/08/17, 13:49 - Arne: You know it when you are in love
04/08/17, 13:49 - Infected: Emotional support isn't as difficult as you'd think. It mostly involves listening and validating their particular feeling of the moment. You have to validate them but still segway them into a more appropriate mode of behavior.
04/08/17, 13:50 - Infected: I.e. I understand how you feel, it's frustrating when someone takes your toy but hitting isn't ok. Etc.
04/08/17, 13:52 - Infected: I talk to my son likes an adult most of the time. He's very independent and he thinks for himself. At that age, it makes him quite stubborn, which is why you have to set up your role as the dominant figure. If a child thinks they can misbehave, they generally will. It's the nature of young children.
04/08/17, 13:53 - Infected: From the period of around 8 months to 4 years, it is somewhat difficult and frustrating. I don't think I'm a great parent but I don't think I'm the worst.
04/08/17, 13:53 - Infected: How?
04/08/17, 13:55 - Janith: Your Fe starts taking over and your reaction is not to kill the process 😂
04/08/17, 13:55 - Infected: Not relatable.
04/08/17, 13:56 - Janith: Be glad for that
04/08/17, 13:57 - Infected: When I was younger, I had a difficult time with relationships. I thought I was supposed to be in one because that's what normal people did.
04/08/17, 13:58 - Infected: But I ended up losing interest quickly and started to dislike whoever my partner was at the time. Eventually, I realized I'm not the type to hold romantic interest in another person.
04/08/17, 13:59 - Infected: I understand the concept of love. I understand what it is. I just don't feel it romantically.
04/08/17, 14:00 - Janith: Do you feel maternal love in the sake way other mothers do?
04/08/17, 14:03 - Infected: I do. I think it's just a little different because I process what I feel differently. I have a responsibility to my offspring and a maternal instinct to protect my child until he reaches adulthood. I have had moments where I look at my child and the feeling I have towards him is almost overwhelming. I think this must mean that I love him in the traditional sense of motherly love.
04/08/17, 14:05 - Janith: Ah okay. I read sometime back that the neural circuitry used in parental affection and romantic love overlap in certain areas
04/08/17, 14:06 - Janith: From your situation I think the overlap (if any) isn't too significant
04/08/17, 14:07 - Infected: I've never had a similar moment of overwhelming feeling towards anyone other than my child which leads me to believe that I have no real concept of what "love" is.
04/08/17, 14:07 - Infected: As it pertains to what I feel, personally. I understand the definition.
04/08/17, 14:09 - Janith: I generally think emotional things like love cannot be truly understood without experiencing them
04/08/17, 14:09 - Janith: Like trying to explain color to a blind man
04/08/17, 14:09 - Infected: There is a good example of this situation in the book "the mask"
04/08/17, 14:10 - Infected: The lead character ties color to sensory perception. Touch.
04/08/17, 14:14 - Janith: Yeah that's what it means. No way to replicate the accompanying sensations and neural connections generated from experiencing color
04/08/17, 14:14 - Janith: Sorry for any future crazy replies btw
04/08/17, 14:15 - Janith: I'm trying to get the most complex video game ever to work in a satisfactory manner
04/08/17, 14:23 - Infected: I have to venture forth out of my house, anyway.
04/08/17, 14:24 - Janith: Oh Damn.. Good luck!
04/08/17, 14:25 - Janith: Stay safe... And other assorted stuff people say
04/08/17, 14:25 - Infected: Alright.
04/08/17, 14:27 - ‪+91 91768 00222‬: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 14:27 - ‪+91 91768 00222‬: Plz enlarge
04/08/17, 14:50 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 14:51 - Lulu: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 15:59 - Circle: U sound like a great parent
04/08/17, 16:01 - Circle: Well put
04/08/17, 16:02 - Infected: Thank you. I definitely try.
04/08/17, 16:02 - Circle: @14843534493 haha
04/08/17, 16:03 - Circle: I think i fear being a lousy parent i also fear id be very stricy due to my nature but eventually when i do havr one i hope im still in contact with you to pick your brain about what i should be doing LOOL
04/08/17, 16:05 - Infected: I'm probably not going anywhere lol
04/08/17, 16:21 - Janith: This is my motivation for asking about your parenting too @15015198024 😂
04/08/17, 16:21 - Janith: I wonder who else here is an INTP parent though
04/08/17, 16:22 - Circle: I havent met any intp parents before but if infected can feel for her child im sure we all can 😂
04/08/17, 16:23 - Janith: We need more data points! 😂
04/08/17, 16:24 - Didier: Kevin,but he's not active lately
04/08/17, 16:24 - Circle: Hehe
04/08/17, 16:24 - Didier: He seems like he's having great fun with his child
04/08/17, 16:24 - Didier: I remember his telling us about it
04/08/17, 16:24 - Didier: children*
04/08/17, 16:25 - Janith: Hey Didi. ☺
Sorry bout not being able to send you anything today. I was sick
04/08/17, 16:25 - Didier: him*
04/08/17, 16:25 - Didier: It's fine
04/08/17, 16:25 - Didier: Anyway I'm tired 😂
04/08/17, 16:25 - Janith: Tomorrow definitely 😉
04/08/17, 16:25 - Didier: Get well soon 🙆🏼
04/08/17, 16:25 - Circle: Are you guys patient people in general?
04/08/17, 16:25 - Janith: (an INTP saying "definitely" amounts to a sorta probably btw)
04/08/17, 16:26 - Circle: Haha
04/08/17, 16:26 - Janith: I have managed to annoy people with my patience sometimes
04/08/17, 16:26 - Shaiju: Kind of missed👆🏻
04/08/17, 16:27 - Didier: It's weird.I can be both very impatient and patient
04/08/17, 16:27 - Circle: Im guessing patient people will do better with children
04/08/17, 16:27 - Janith: Same here
04/08/17, 16:27 - Didier: Ik,same for infp 😂
04/08/17, 16:27 - Janith: I might not have children though 😅
04/08/17, 16:27 - Circle: Why?
04/08/17, 16:28 - Janith: Unless they're made in a lab 🤓
04/08/17, 16:28 - Circle: LOL
04/08/17, 16:28 - Didier: Test tube babies
04/08/17, 16:28 - Janith: I don't get what all the fuss is about
04/08/17, 16:28 - Shaiju: Motherhood is entirely different beast.. there is saying which goes by "a mother is also born with the kid".. so it might be different I guess.
04/08/17, 16:28 - Didier: I know someone who is a test tube baby
04/08/17, 16:28 - Shaiju: *a
04/08/17, 16:29 - Circle: Out of curiosity i really want to experience maternal love and pregnancy not so much child birth .
04/08/17, 16:29 - Janith: Eeeh more like embryo grown in artificial womb carrying the first genetic material modified for a use other than fixing a disease 😅
04/08/17, 16:29 - Shaiju: So test tube is it's mother technically?
04/08/17, 16:29 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 16:29 - Didier: No,still the samw mother
04/08/17, 16:29 - Didier: Just
04/08/17, 16:29 - Didier: In a test tube
04/08/17, 16:29 - Circle: Hahs
04/08/17, 16:29 - Didier: Not in the mother
04/08/17, 16:30 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 16:30 - Janith: Will you be willing to take the baby I create? 😂
04/08/17, 16:30 - Circle: Im pretty fascinated by cloning
04/08/17, 16:30 - Didier: Same
04/08/17, 16:30 - Janith: I figure I'll need to make a bunch since you can't draw accurate conclusions from a single speciman
04/08/17, 16:31 - Shaiju: They should have kept the test tube for the kid though... He should have given a chance to see .. :) it's his mother afterall! People can be cruel sometimes!
04/08/17, 16:31 - Didier: Draw conclusions about?
04/08/17, 16:31 - Circle: Im having doubts about my own skills at raising my own child let alone someone elses hahs
04/08/17, 16:31 - Janith: Mother is not a test tube. The fetus gets implanted layer
04/08/17, 16:31 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 16:31 - Janith: *later
04/08/17, 16:31 - Didier: "U were born in a test tube."
04/08/17, 16:31 - Shaiju: Pun intended!😌
04/08/17, 16:32 - Didier: Years later in biology class...
04/08/17, 16:32 - Didier: Babies are born in the womb
04/08/17, 16:32 - Circle: I dont understand why they cant recreate the womb for the embryo
04/08/17, 16:32 - Janith: Tbh after birth I'm not sure what to do with them. I thought giving them up fit adoption would be good since throwing them in a trash can might be frowned upon
04/08/17, 16:33 - Circle: Sorry are u female?
04/08/17, 16:33 - Janith: I just need them to observe the processes involved during the formation
04/08/17, 16:33 - Janith: Nope.
04/08/17, 16:33 - Circle: Yeah i heard about people frowning about that
04/08/17, 16:34 - Janith: @6582280971 you mentioned you have memory of the time in the fetus right?
04/08/17, 16:34 - Circle: I have a feeling that intp parents would either be brilliant or very bad
04/08/17, 16:34 - Didier: Yeah 😂 U still remember
04/08/17, 16:35 - Circle: Whaaaaaat no way ?
04/08/17, 16:35 - Janith: I'm the latter 🙋‍♂
04/08/17, 16:35 - Didier: I'm not the only one
04/08/17, 16:35 - Didier: Other people online too
04/08/17, 16:35 - Circle: I fear that about myself
04/08/17, 16:35 - Janith: That's half the reason I'm considering the fetus tests 😂
04/08/17, 16:35 - Didier: 😂It's fascinating
04/08/17, 16:35 - Circle: What do you remember 😮
04/08/17, 16:35 - Janith: I want to see the stage of development at which the fetus forms thoughts
04/08/17, 16:36 - Didier: It was conpletely dark
04/08/17, 16:36 - Didier: U know when u off the lights
04/08/17, 16:36 - Circle: Yes
04/08/17, 16:36 - Didier: And u close ur eyes
04/08/17, 16:36 - Janith: A bunch of artificial womb in an MRI should work
04/08/17, 16:36 - Didier: That kind of darkness
04/08/17, 16:36 - Didier: Without any light at all
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: I was scared
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: I wanted to get out of there
04/08/17, 16:37 - Circle: Have any intps expierenced iowasca (spelling is incorrect)?
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: And I wasn't able to think in worfs
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: Words*
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: But I was able to think
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: Feel
04/08/17, 16:37 - Janith: Which is?
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: Surprisingly I was premature
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: And I have a fear or darkness
04/08/17, 16:37 - Circle: I would have thought fear develops later
04/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: Since the start
04/08/17, 16:38 - Circle: Dmt ?
04/08/17, 16:38 - Didier: Dmt?
04/08/17, 16:38 - Janith: I'm thinking of getting the pro-life crowd to fun my research into baby thoughts then stabbing them in the back actually
04/08/17, 16:38 - Didier: No I was really scared
04/08/17, 16:38 - Didier: But then I could feel other things outside
04/08/17, 16:39 - Didier: I mean
04/08/17, 16:39 - Janith: There's a theory that states that the fear of the dark is a remnant from birth
04/08/17, 16:39 - Didier: I could feel that there are other things outside
04/08/17, 16:39 - Circle: Could it have been a dream when you were verh young ?
04/08/17, 16:39 - Didier: What's pro-life about?
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: Didn't reallt bother to search
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: Really?!
04/08/17, 16:40 - Janith: Forcing women to have children they don't want to have and/can't afford to support
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: No
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: My mom told me that
04/08/17, 16:40 - Circle: There against abortions
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: I have been telling her
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: Since the very staft
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: Start*
04/08/17, 16:40 - Didier: Until now
04/08/17, 16:41 - Janith: Whoa now. It's pure speculation. No proof behind it obviously 😂
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: She thought I was joking until she realised I wasn't
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: And I remember my dreams
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: Unlike others
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: I can differentiate
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: And I still remember when I was a few months old too
04/08/17, 16:41 - Didier: My mom playing peek a boo with me
04/08/17, 16:42 - Didier: On a sofa
04/08/17, 16:42 - Circle: You could have had the dream before you learnt to speak.  Sorry im very sceptical but anythings possible
04/08/17, 16:42 - Janith: Basically I plan on having those idiots make what will probably be their only good contribution to humanity
04/08/17, 16:43 - Didier: Meaning against abortion?
04/08/17, 16:43 - Circle: Janith how r u so evil . Im hoping you are joking
04/08/17, 16:43 - Didier: Because of this weird experience,
04/08/17, 16:43 - Didier: I'm kinda finding the idea of abortion scary yet I think abortion is necessary at times
04/08/17, 16:44 - Circle: But if the fetus is thinking then isnt it murder?
04/08/17, 16:45 - Didier: Phone died
04/08/17, 16:45 - Didier: Anyway
04/08/17, 16:45 - Didier: That was what I was thinking
04/08/17, 16:46 - Janith: Borderline sociopath I am
04/08/17, 16:46 - Didier: Where did u find that speculation though?
04/08/17, 16:46 - Circle: That makes it sad
04/08/17, 16:46 - Didier: I would like to look into it
04/08/17, 16:46 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 16:46 - Janith: Stopped pretending to be a good person a while back
04/08/17, 16:46 - Didier: And how was it speculated?
04/08/17, 16:46 - Janith: Technically yes
04/08/17, 16:47 - Janith: Unfortunately I can't remember. It was years back
04/08/17, 16:47 - Didier: It didn't seem like a dream thougj
04/08/17, 16:47 - Didier: I have many dreams and
04/08/17, 16:47 - Didier: Including nightmares but
04/08/17, 16:47 - Didier: The memory of that experience was more vivid last time
04/08/17, 16:48 - Didier: I could remember details more specifically
04/08/17, 16:48 - Didier: I can still remember now
04/08/17, 16:48 - Didier: But not as specifically
04/08/17, 16:48 - Didier: As the memory becomes more distant
04/08/17, 16:49 - Didier: I didn't even know that babies are in the womb
04/08/17, 16:49 - Didier: But it felt like I was inside something
04/08/17, 16:49 - Didier: I don't know how to explain hmm
04/08/17, 16:51 - Janith: Usually I'd be skeptical too but the thing is that we just don't know how the brain functions during development in the womb
04/08/17, 16:51 - Didier: It felt like I can move but
04/08/17, 16:51 - Didier: My movements were restricted
04/08/17, 16:51 - Didier: I am trying to recall as much as possible
04/08/17, 16:52 - Didier: Same
04/08/17, 16:52 - Didier: This is unlike any memory I had so
04/08/17, 16:52 - Didier: And I've also thought about whether it's possible it's a dream but
04/08/17, 16:53 - Didier: I have a very good yet very bad memory it's weird
04/08/17, 16:54 - Didier: It doesn't feel like it
04/08/17, 16:54 - Didier: Wait let me search up about the speculation
04/08/17, 16:55 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 16:55 - Didier: That it explains this
04/08/17, 16:56 - Didier: So u can say if my memory is true,I was already quite developed in the womb
04/08/17, 16:57 - Circle: But why would a fetus be scared of the dark if its never seen light?
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: I don't know
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: To me
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: It's just scary
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: There was nothing
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: And it's dark
04/08/17, 16:57 - Didier: I felt alone yet
04/08/17, 16:58 - Didier: I feel that there's something else outside
04/08/17, 16:58 - Didier: It was a piece of nothingness,just plain black
04/08/17, 16:58 - Circle: I also thought babies dint open their eyes until they r born
04/08/17, 16:58 - Didier: Yeah
04/08/17, 16:58 - Didier: I never opened my eyes
04/08/17, 16:58 - Didier: Probably that's why it's black
04/08/17, 16:59 - Circle: If you did open yours then you would have felt a whole lot of amniotic fluid in them
04/08/17, 17:00 - Circle: It would be black even if u did open because ther isny aany light
04/08/17, 17:00 - Didier: And I remember that I've never seen light at that time
04/08/17, 17:00 - Didier: I didn't know how's light like
04/08/17, 17:00 - Didier: But when I was conscious,all I see was black
04/08/17, 17:00 - Didier: And I was scared
04/08/17, 17:01 - Didier: It was jet black
04/08/17, 17:01 - Janith: @447544834100 remember that humans have a natural tendency to fear the unknown
04/08/17, 17:02 - Didier: See,not necessarily with my eyes
04/08/17, 17:02 - Didier: U know when
04/08/17, 17:02 - Didier: U close ur eyes
04/08/17, 17:02 - Didier: And the black u see
04/08/17, 17:02 - Circle: Surely the psychological reason behind fear is caused my some sort of stimulation for the chemicals to be realised.
04/08/17, 17:02 - Didier: Yeah I remember thinking
04/08/17, 17:03 - Didier: Fearing the unknown
04/08/17, 17:03 - Didier: But my thoughts has no words at all
04/08/17, 17:03 - Didier: They were just thoughts/feelings
04/08/17, 17:03 - Didier: It's weird
04/08/17, 17:04 - Circle: The unknown in a fetuses case would be whats outside not what it began with. Eg children in war torn countries are less scared of bomb blast noises because they become desensitized
04/08/17, 17:04 - Didier: And sure enough,since childhood,I am afraid of the dark
04/08/17, 17:04 - Janith: That's why I really want to do that experiment. An artificial womb with a fetus would be perfect for observing brain activity during development
04/08/17, 17:04 - Didier: As if I was already scared before that
04/08/17, 17:05 - Didier: I'm scared with both
04/08/17, 17:05 - Didier: But how can u be so sure we are not afraid with what we begin with?
04/08/17, 17:05 - Didier: For example
04/08/17, 17:05 - Didier: If we begin with something that's not scary,of course we won't be afraid
04/08/17, 17:06 - Circle: What your saying sounds like we should fear day light . But we dont becausr we see it everyday
04/08/17, 17:06 - Didier: If we begin with abuse,we will be afraid
04/08/17, 17:07 - Didier: But it's not as if they weren't scared when they first started
04/08/17, 17:07 - Janith: Heliophobia
04/08/17, 17:07 - Didier: They just got desensitized
04/08/17, 17:07 - Circle: Lots of children that wer sexually abused for long periods of time become promiscuous adults because that becomes their norm
04/08/17, 17:07 - Arne: Might be one of the reasons that I am afraid of the night. There is these days so much light in the air when it's night that it isn't really dark anymore. So when it is... It is scary
04/08/17, 17:07 - Didier: No that's not what I mean
04/08/17, 17:08 - Didier: What I'm saying is the start
04/08/17, 17:08 - Didier: It doesn't mean they weren't afraid at the start
04/08/17, 17:08 - Didier: Anyone would be
04/08/17, 17:09 - Circle: Hmm im sorry i still domt believe it dont take it personally i just feel like its very possible as a baby someone jokingly put you in a cupboard where it was dark and your mistaking it for being a fetus . 
I really want to believe you but i cant im sorry
04/08/17, 17:09 - Didier: I'm afraid of the darkness though I see it everyday
04/08/17, 17:10 - Didier: It's fine.I said it,expecting people not to believe it sometimes
04/08/17, 17:10 - Circle: Your scared because you cant see in the dark but if you had never seen you wouldn't br scared
04/08/17, 17:11 - Didier: How can u be so sure because I've never seen it,I wouldn't be scared?
04/08/17, 17:11 - Didier: It's possible to be or not be scared
04/08/17, 17:12 - Circle: I dont think its possible to have fear without any stimulation
04/08/17, 17:12 - Arne: Everytime you recall, the memory is a little different.
04/08/17, 17:12 - Didier: I know that
04/08/17, 17:13 - Circle: I just cant get my head around why someone would fear the only thing they do know instesd of the unknown of being outsidr
04/08/17, 17:13 - Didier: I read psychology 😂
04/08/17, 17:13 - Didier: But it's true I do fear it in that way
04/08/17, 17:14 - Arne: I have said this before. But it must have in that the "experience" you had, a corner of Truth. Or how you say this
04/08/17, 17:14 - Didier: Even though this event may not have happened,but I can see a fatal flaw in ur logic @447544834100.You made a few assumptions
04/08/17, 17:14 - Circle: It cant be a fear of the unknown because you said you wanted to get out. Yet you did not know whats outside
04/08/17, 17:15 - Didier: The stimulation is the darkness itself
04/08/17, 17:15 - Circle: The only feasable thing is that you wer a baby and a traumatic incident like being put in a cupboard is what your remembering
04/08/17, 17:15 - Didier: But in the womb,I was scared of what may be outside and the dark both
04/08/17, 17:15 - Didier: No it felt like I can move but my movements were quite restricted
04/08/17, 17:16 - Didier: And it didn't feel hard
04/08/17, 17:16 - Circle: But you said so yourself that you wanted to go out. And out is the real unknown
04/08/17, 17:16 - Didier: I don't remember it as traumatic though
04/08/17, 17:16 - Circle: You could have been swaddled in a blanket
04/08/17, 17:17 - Didier: Both are the unknown
04/08/17, 17:17 - Didier: Not that restricted
04/08/17, 17:17 - Didier: It felt restricted but not that restricted
04/08/17, 17:17 - Circle: Loosly swaddled then
04/08/17, 17:18 - Arne: Bruh
04/08/17, 17:18 - Arne: Hina
04/08/17, 17:18 - Circle: ?
04/08/17, 17:18 - Arne: ..
04/08/17, 17:18 - Didier: Sorry but ur logic is flawed.Just because someone starts with something,doesn't mean that they don't fear it at that time.
04/08/17, 17:19 - Didier: It's possible to fear or not fear it
04/08/17, 17:19 - Didier: Depending on what it is
04/08/17, 17:19 - Arne: You are just searching for something you cant find
04/08/17, 17:19 - Didier: How it is
04/08/17, 17:19 - Didier: How it feels
04/08/17, 17:19 - Circle: How do you mean
04/08/17, 17:19 - Didier: Because of this memory,I would like to work for it
04/08/17, 17:19 - Arne: Like she said: your logic is flawed at this point
04/08/17, 17:20 - Didier: Find out about the fetus' brain development
04/08/17, 17:20 - Circle: What is the psychology behind fear ?
04/08/17, 17:20 - Didier: It's fascinating
04/08/17, 17:20 - Didier: How much is it developed at that point?
04/08/17, 17:20 - Didier: We still don't know exactly,but what we know is that the fear exists.
04/08/17, 17:21 - Circle: Do you think all fetuses fear the dark and are having a bad time in there ? Or is it just you?
04/08/17, 17:21 - Didier: There's something our brain associates with with what we r afraid of
04/08/17, 17:21 - Didier: I'm not the only one remembering being in the womb
04/08/17, 17:21 - Arne: Didier, you wanna be president or scientist?
04/08/17, 17:22 - Didier: They may not have feared the dark,I don't know but
04/08/17, 17:22 - Didier: What I know is that my fear of the dark existed from the very start
04/08/17, 17:22 - Didier: And I don't know how early,but very early
04/08/17, 17:23 - Circle: Hmm i think we should just agree to disagree because we both dont have any proof .
04/08/17, 17:23 - Didier: 😂 Can't decide
04/08/17, 17:23 - Infected: Afternoon.
04/08/17, 17:23 - Didier: I would have to think about the priorities
04/08/17, 17:23 - Circle: Hello infectdd
04/08/17, 17:23 - Infected: Hello.
04/08/17, 17:24 - Didier: That's why I should research more 😂
04/08/17, 17:24 - Didier: I just don't have enough information
04/08/17, 17:24 - Arne: It has to do with the earlier days of the human. When we had only our instincts.
04/08/17, 17:24 - Didier: But if I were to listen to my heart,scientist
04/08/17, 17:25 - Circle: If only we could see inside each others brain
04/08/17, 17:25 - Didier: Hi infected
04/08/17, 17:25 - Infected: Hello.
04/08/17, 17:25 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 17:25 - Arne: Cool,  at least both are very memorable
04/08/17, 17:25 - Didier: Oh yeah.
04/08/17, 17:25 - Infected: I wish I could take my brain apart and study it while still being able to survive.
04/08/17, 17:25 - Didier: I think that's how feelings come about
04/08/17, 17:26 - Didier: Feelings involve instincts,before we even think
04/08/17, 17:26 - Circle: Yeah it would be cool
04/08/17, 17:26 - Arne: Even if it won't be those two, I know for sure you gonna do some great things.
04/08/17, 17:26 - Didier: 😂Same
04/08/17, 17:26 - Didier: I would be dead though...
04/08/17, 17:27 - Tel: Less used to, rather than unable?
04/08/17, 17:27 - Tel: Lol!
04/08/17, 17:27 - Didier: People either look down on me or call me smart in school.I may not have a great job,but I believe I will do some great things.
04/08/17, 17:27 - Infected: More accurate.
04/08/17, 17:27 - Didier: I think my affiliation with people will affect my future
04/08/17, 17:28 - Tel: I think that this is similar to how I would do it, based on how I manage my staff (yes, I'm calling them my children.. Haha)
04/08/17, 17:28 - Infected: It effected mine. I wanted to be a marine biologist.
04/08/17, 17:28 - Circle: Well dont listen to people that put you down they will eat your creativity
04/08/17, 17:28 - Infected: Instead, eh.
04/08/17, 17:29 - Tel: Lol!
04/08/17, 17:29 - Didier: Who's Circle? 😂
04/08/17, 17:29 - Circle: Its me hina LOL
04/08/17, 17:29 - Didier: Instead,what is it? 😂
04/08/17, 17:29 - Infected: I have no idea how to be a parent. I'm winging it, basically. The kid still lives.
04/08/17, 17:30 - Tel: Yea. 'definitely, unless another more likely scenario pops up. But definitely until then.'
04/08/17, 17:30 - Arne: Yeah
04/08/17, 17:30 - Infected: I'm a hermit that's about half mentally retarded.
04/08/17, 17:30 - Didier: Ok hehe
04/08/17, 17:30 - Infected: This
04/08/17, 17:30 - Tel: Lol, am sure you're amazing. Sounds it from what you say and how you communicate here.
04/08/17, 17:31 - Circle: I second this
04/08/17, 17:31 - Didier: Not a stay at home mom right?
04/08/17, 17:32 - Circle: Didier i dont know why bug i imagine you look like salena gomez 🤣
04/08/17, 17:32 - Didier: No way 🤣
04/08/17, 17:33 - Circle: LOL
04/08/17, 17:33 - Circle: My imagination is crazy right i even imagine her talking while i read your messages haha i must be psyco
04/08/17, 17:34 - Infected: Yes.
04/08/17, 17:34 - Didier: Do I somehow remind u of her? 😂
04/08/17, 17:34 - Didier: Yes it is crazy
04/08/17, 17:34 - Circle: No its a just a very uneducated feeling haha
04/08/17, 17:35 - Didier: What?
04/08/17, 17:35 - Circle: I mean i really have no basis for thinkinh that my subconscious just put it there
04/08/17, 17:36 - Didier: Oh okay I got it right
04/08/17, 17:36 - Didier: Hmm
04/08/17, 17:37 - Circle: Im guessing u look nothing like her then 🤣
04/08/17, 17:37 - Tel: ?
04/08/17, 17:37 - Infected: I usually imagine a portly old male professor when reading @6582280971  posts. Even though I know she's quite young and a female.
04/08/17, 17:37 - Tel: What is iowasca??
04/08/17, 17:37 - Didier: Wow great imagination people
04/08/17, 17:37 - Arne: Didier is a natural beauty
04/08/17, 17:37 - Didier: I shall become a Selena Gomez who became a professor
04/08/17, 17:38 - Didier: How about that 😉
04/08/17, 17:38 - Arne: At least from the inside
04/08/17, 17:38 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 17:38 - Arne: 😉
04/08/17, 17:38 - Circle: Haha thats hilarious.  Weirdly most people think im male when writing but i feel like i write quite feminine
04/08/17, 17:38 - Didier: But yes I'm kinda fat
04/08/17, 17:38 - Circle: Im intrigued now
04/08/17, 17:38 - Infected: People often think I'm a male.
04/08/17, 17:39 - Didier: Same hair and maybe face shape
04/08/17, 17:39 - Didier: Diff facial features
04/08/17, 17:39 - Didier: I can't believe u r reading everything 😂
04/08/17, 17:39 - Circle: I also originally thought that
04/08/17, 17:39 - Didier: Thanks 😃
04/08/17, 17:39 - Infected: See.
04/08/17, 17:40 - Didier: I'm not fat fat but
04/08/17, 17:40 - Tel: Hm, maybe entirely different, but I get sensations (very, very infrequently) which I associate with when I was extremely small, but have no memory of.. If that makes any sense at all. I wouldn't even be able to describe it without it sounding odd.. Like, my thumb is meant to be bigger than it is is prob as good as I can do. #oddthoughtoftheday
04/08/17, 17:40 - Arne: 🤔, interesting
04/08/17, 17:40 - Infected: I wonder how it comes about that we imagine someone to be male/female based solely upon how they type responses to posts.
04/08/17, 17:40 - Didier: Big thighs
04/08/17, 17:41 - Circle: Ayahuasca is a herbal thing that people drink for the dmt to have enlightening experiences . Old shamans
04/08/17, 17:41 - Didier: Your thumb is meant to be bigger as it is?
04/08/17, 17:42 - Didier: I think it's our built up portrayal of male and female traits
04/08/17, 17:42 - Didier: The wat they speak
04/08/17, 17:43 - Circle: I really dont know therr must be some logic
04/08/17, 17:43 - Didier: way
04/08/17, 17:43 - Infected: The earliest thought that I can remember is that I'm from somewhere else and at some point I awakened as this being. Entirely strange. It was like a light bulb turned on. I don't remember being a "person" before that.
04/08/17, 17:43 - Tel: Ppl can inherit fear. Well, at least, it's proven in rodents.
04/08/17, 17:43 - Didier: From experiences maybe?
04/08/17, 17:43 - Circle: Aww man i wish i had some memmories like that i think i blanked out most of my childhood
04/08/17, 17:44 - Tel: 👋🏻
04/08/17, 17:44 - Didier: If people thought that u r male instead of female,that person must have rarely met females who speak like u
04/08/17, 17:44 - Circle: Fascinating
04/08/17, 17:44 - Infected: 👋🏻
04/08/17, 17:44 - Infected: Possibly.
04/08/17, 17:45 - Tel: I was wondering too!! Why the change @447544834100?
04/08/17, 17:45 - Infected: Most of my human interactions are online.
04/08/17, 17:45 - Didier: Tel is still reading those messages! 😂
04/08/17, 17:45 - Tel: Lol. And no definition of iowasca!! Frustrating?!?
04/08/17, 17:46 - Circle: I changed it because i think like infected i would prefer not to have my name on display even though its a bit late now
04/08/17, 17:46 - Arne: Tru
04/08/17, 17:46 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 17:46 - Didier: U have it now
04/08/17, 17:46 - Didier: Come back Tel!@
04/08/17, 17:46 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 17:46 - Didier: Same,we have something in common
04/08/17, 17:47 - Tel: It's a weird feeling. No logic whatsoever. No insight into it at all. Next time I feel it, I'll write it down. I can't remember the last time, though, so might be a while.. 

That said, I'm Gna be hella drunk next week (festival), so maybe that'll help me regress... Haha 😂
04/08/17, 17:47 - Infected: I don't like for people I have a light association with to know my personal details. It must stem from my propensity towards paranoia.
04/08/17, 17:47 - Tel: Interesting.. Any other context?
04/08/17, 17:47 - Tel: Inherit as in they are born with it based on the experiences of their ancestors.
04/08/17, 17:48 - Tel: I'll look up the research.
04/08/17, 17:48 - Tel: Nearly caught up.. You guys type a lot.. More than even me..
04/08/17, 17:48 - Circle: Im quite paranoid myself but i didnt even realise my name was on display until it was too late. Although i have no problem with keeping my own pictures on display wierd right
04/08/17, 17:49 - Tel: How'd I miss that?!? I even remember the pic. Just thought it was random I think.
04/08/17, 17:49 - Infected: It's hard to explain as these are thoughts from my childhood. This particular memory stands out more than others.
04/08/17, 17:49 - Didier: For experiences,I was talking about the female-malw thing haha
04/08/17, 17:49 - Tel: I think I've heard of that. Is it in Latin America or something? That, or something similar, caused my friend to come home, quit his successful city job, and become a photographer.. Because he loved it.
04/08/17, 17:49 - Tel: Kudos to him I guess.
04/08/17, 17:49 - Infected: I'm rarely random. To myself, anyway.
04/08/17, 17:49 - Didier: But how do u know it's inherited from the experiences of our ancestors?
04/08/17, 17:50 - Tel: 😂😂😂
04/08/17, 17:50 - Didier: It's fascinating to think about it
04/08/17, 17:50 - Infected: Have you read about inherited memory?
04/08/17, 17:50 - Circle: Yes . Some people end up for the worse though sad really
04/08/17, 17:50 - Tel: True. I should have known that. Noted ;)
04/08/17, 17:51 - Infected: : )
04/08/17, 17:51 - Didier: Not really
04/08/17, 17:51 - Didier: Ok search time
04/08/17, 17:51 - Arne: Hina ❤ if I am righttt
04/08/17, 17:51 - Didier: Tel remember to search the rodent thing!
04/08/17, 17:52 - Circle: What?
04/08/17, 17:52 - Tel: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.newscientist.com/article/dn24677-fear-of-a-smell-can-be-passed-down-several-generations/amp/

This isn't the one I read before, but is similar.
04/08/17, 17:52 - Tel: ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
04/08/17, 17:52 - Infected: My mother has dreams that she is 100% certain are inherited memories from her ancestors. I like to imagine how that would be possible vs improbable.
04/08/17, 17:53 - Didier: Haha tel
04/08/17, 17:53 - Tel: The one I read was about shocks + a courted box I think. The offspring wouldn't / didn't like entering the same coloured box. Fascinating.
04/08/17, 17:53 - Didier: Hmm I had this weird nightmare before
04/08/17, 17:53 - Didier: Unlike any other nightmare
04/08/17, 17:53 - Didier: I was shot with many arrows
04/08/17, 17:53 - Didier: I think I died
04/08/17, 17:54 - Didier: How does she know though?What is it about?
04/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: That's interesting.
04/08/17, 17:54 - Circle: Dreams are interesting in itself especially lucid dreams
04/08/17, 17:54 - Tel: https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/21/study-of-holocaust-survivors-finds-trauma-passed-on-to-childrens-genes

Interesting! Re humans too.. Though not quite as scientific, perhaps, as the mice one
04/08/17, 17:54 - Infected: Some lady that looks vaguely like her that dies in a horrible way.
04/08/17, 17:55 - Tel: You shot the arrows wrong, then?
04/08/17, 17:55 - Tel: 😂
04/08/17, 17:55 - Arne: Is your mom religious?
04/08/17, 17:55 - Infected: I die in nearly all of my dreams. I chalk it up to an overactive subconscious.
04/08/17, 17:55 - Didier: No,I was shot
04/08/17, 17:55 - Tel: (the joke is at the illogical consistency rather than the aftermath.. :p)
04/08/17, 17:55 - Circle: Agreed
04/08/17, 17:56 - Tel: Oooo. I read wrong. Damn.
04/08/17, 17:56 - Didier: Suddenly
04/08/17, 17:56 - Tel: Mean mum!
04/08/17, 17:56 - Infected: She used to be then she decided that religion was an abomination to the natural order.
04/08/17, 17:56 - Tel: Wow. I'm confusing things. Timeout for Terry..
04/08/17, 17:56 - Didier: I've never died in my dreams except once I think
04/08/17, 17:56 - Didier: It just ended therr
04/08/17, 17:56 - Circle: I think religion was the substitute for governments back in the day LOL
04/08/17, 17:57 - Tel: Yup. That's what I think. It's a good way to control ppl.
04/08/17, 17:57 - Didier: Now we know ur name is Terry
04/08/17, 17:57 - Infected: I have really vivid dreams. I tend to die horribly/ painfully. Usually ripped apart by various forms of monsters. I think this is the subconscious manifestation of my mental illness.
04/08/17, 17:57 - Didier: 😏
04/08/17, 17:58 - Didier: Yeah same
04/08/17, 17:58 - Infected: Agreed. People who are afraid up to a certain point are easier to control. Religion breeds fear.
04/08/17, 17:58 - Tel: Yea. Embarrassingly it's short for my nan's name, Teresa. Couldn't just have a 'normal' male life and be taken the mick out of because it was derived from Terence, eh..
04/08/17, 17:59 - Didier: Wow.I have many nightmares but it usually involves other people
04/08/17, 17:59 - Didier: My dreams are quite vivid too
04/08/17, 18:00 - Tel: Interesting. Many others have nightmares? 

I used to have more, but has significantly decreased in the last months / years.
04/08/17, 18:00 - Circle: My dreams often involve me taking care of a baby
04/08/17, 18:00 - Didier: 😂Terry sounds like...
04/08/17, 18:00 - Arne: The most dreams I do remember had a shade of  war
04/08/17, 18:00 - Didier: I have more nightmares now than I have before
04/08/17, 18:00 - Didier: And I know why
04/08/17, 18:01 - Circle: I also dresm alot aboug being in a plane and emergency landings
04/08/17, 18:01 - Didier: What mental disorder do u have though Infected?
04/08/17, 18:01 - Infected: The earliest nightmare that I can recall was when I was around 12/13. I would have the same one every night. The school bus would stop at this certain road down the street from my house. A figure of shadow would walk onto the bus and stab me in the stomache. It's quite an odd feeling.
04/08/17, 18:01 - Circle: Y
04/08/17, 18:01 - Tel: Care to elaborate?
04/08/17, 18:01 - Didier: What?😂
04/08/17, 18:02 - Circle: Im a wierdo lol horrible nightmares
04/08/17, 18:02 - Tel: Think mine was falling from a bridge. Used to have that a lot when I was in my teens.
04/08/17, 18:02 - Didier: Life and developing mental illness
04/08/17, 18:02 - Infected: A few months later it was discovered that a pedophile lived on that road. He had molested several of the neighborhood children and shot himself in the head at the very point where the bus stopped in my dream.
04/08/17, 18:02 - Didier: Family problems
04/08/17, 18:02 - Didier: School,and friendship problems
04/08/17, 18:02 - Didier: Abuse
04/08/17, 18:03 - Didier: That's weird
04/08/17, 18:03 - Didier: I have very weird dreams too
04/08/17, 18:03 - Didier: But not dreams like urs
04/08/17, 18:03 - Didier: Wow.
04/08/17, 18:03 - Didier: U know precognition dreams?
04/08/17, 18:04 - Didier: I only had 1 so far
04/08/17, 18:04 - Didier: And it shocked me...
04/08/17, 18:04 - Infected: I would hope that people don't often have dreams like mine lol
04/08/17, 18:04 - Arne: What is that?
04/08/17, 18:04 - Tel: Hm, sorry to hear Dids. Am glad you're in this group, though.. Good place to let ya hair down with similar folk ;)
04/08/17, 18:04 - Didier: I developed many theories when I was with my friends
04/08/17, 18:04 - Didier: I can't remember exactly but
04/08/17, 18:05 - Circle: Anyway guys im going to bed cant wait to wake-up to about 2000 messages 🤣👋
04/08/17, 18:05 - Tel: Where you dream something before it happens. Like a soothsayer maybe.. 

Hm, suddenly inarticulate much?
04/08/17, 18:05 - Didier: They are dreams but they happen later on in real life
04/08/17, 18:05 - Infected: I think precog is something that your mind is aware of but it isn't in focus in your thoughts. That's how I explain some of my dreams and strange insights.
04/08/17, 18:05 - Didier: They are usually not exactly the same
04/08/17, 18:05 - Tel: N'nyt!!
04/08/17, 18:05 - Didier: But something similar happens
04/08/17, 18:05 - Didier: And the similarity is shocking
04/08/17, 18:06 - Arne: Hmm
04/08/17, 18:06 - Didier: Byee👋🏻
04/08/17, 18:06 - Infected: It's pretty strange, true.
04/08/17, 18:06 - Arne: Interesting. Never had that
04/08/17, 18:06 - Arne: Only some deja vu's
04/08/17, 18:06 - Didier: I was thinking
04/08/17, 18:06 - Didier: What if our lives are loops
04/08/17, 18:06 - Didier: It keeps on happening
04/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: Ditto I think. Or maybe my Si is so useless I didn't notice I being played out.. 😉
04/08/17, 18:06 - Tel: It*
04/08/17, 18:06 - Infected: People think I'm a psychic at times and it sits wrong in my head.
04/08/17, 18:07 - Didier: That's why we have deja vus and precognition dreams
04/08/17, 18:07 - Arne: That would be shocking Didier, I remember something about a movie, which had that concept
04/08/17, 18:07 - Didier: Lol
04/08/17, 18:07 - Tel: Minority reports?
04/08/17, 18:07 - Arne: Idk Tel,
04/08/17, 18:07 - Didier: I've always wanted to watch it but never
04/08/17, 18:08 - Didier: But minority report has that concept?
04/08/17, 18:08 - Tel: Yup
04/08/17, 18:08 - Infected: This reminds me of the first season of a TV show. Something about witches at an Academy stuck in a time loop.
04/08/17, 18:08 - Arne: Don't know the name. It was about a girl I thought, who lived everyday the same day
04/08/17, 18:09 - Infected: That could be 100 first dates lul.
04/08/17, 18:09 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 18:09 - Infected: Groundhogs day is also similar. Time loops are a running theme in media.
04/08/17, 18:09 - Didier: N every time it happened,our memory resets
04/08/17, 18:10 - Didier: But somehow there's a flaw
04/08/17, 18:10 - Didier: And we we have a feeling that it happened before
04/08/17, 18:10 - Didier: Because it did
04/08/17, 18:10 - Infected: I imagine so. It would be difficult to completely wipe a memory.
04/08/17, 18:10 - Didier: Who knows what happens before and after birth anyway?
04/08/17, 18:10 - Didier: death*
04/08/17, 18:11 - Didier: U know that feeling
04/08/17, 18:11 - Didier: When u remember something but u don't know what
04/08/17, 18:11 - Didier: Then u found out u actually know that something
04/08/17, 18:11 - Tel: http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/intp_survival

Save the link and read later.. Looks hilarious from my initial read
04/08/17, 18:11 - Infected: I like the different arrays of theories on this topic.
04/08/17, 18:11 - Didier: Same concept
04/08/17, 18:13 - Infected: Haha #2. Kill the INTJ's
04/08/17, 18:13 - Tel: 😂😂😂😂
04/08/17, 18:14 - Didier: That is funny 😂
04/08/17, 18:17 - Infected: This is brilliant.
04/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: "On their solitary journey they will often be mistaken for ISTP Vigilantes and asked to solve the problems of small helpless towns.  But instead of defeating the scourge, they will design a carefully thought-out system that will solve the problem permanently.  Alas, it will be too complicated for the simple-minded townsfolk to understand"

😂😂😂
04/08/17, 18:22 - Tel: Lmao
04/08/17, 18:23 - Tel: "Assuming that the other survivors do not drive the INTP off by complaining about their new party member’s “addiction” to the computer or the usual INTP smell, the INTP will plod quietly along in back, making an occasional joke that nobody gets" 
🤣
04/08/17, 18:24 - Tel: I'll stop posting.. But do recommend reading. And for other typos. I imagine they're funny too.
04/08/17, 18:28 - Didier: 😂
04/08/17, 18:29 - Tel: The 2nd one is even better I think. Hilarious
04/08/17, 18:30 - Infected: This is perfect 👍🏻
04/08/17, 18:33 - Infected: "Sometimes, the group will even ignore the INTP and not suffer, which will annoy the INTP more than if the whole party were eaten by monsters." 

Relatable
04/08/17, 18:34 - Tel: Lol yes, totally
04/08/17, 18:34 - Tel: I had a go at my footie mgr for allowing someone to take a penalty that I had earned despite this other guy not being a regular in the team and, therefore, it being of no use
04/08/17, 18:35 - Tel: His response was 'but he scored'. I was like 'that's besides the point!'
04/08/17, 18:35 - Tel: Hahahaha
04/08/17, 18:37 - Infected: I'm glad I'm not the only one making preparations for the inevitable break down of society.
04/08/17, 18:39 - Infected: I'm actually formulating a plan to build an underground bunker that is entirely self sustainable. Therefore, no matter what the issue, you wouldn't have to be above ground to experience it with the rest of the populace.
04/08/17, 18:40 - Tel: Haha!
04/08/17, 18:41 - Tel: Is that quite an American thing to do?
04/08/17, 18:41 - Tel: I only ever hear about it in Americans
04/08/17, 18:42 - Arne: When you wanna have this finished?
04/08/17, 18:44 - Infected: Finished? Probably never, tbh. I'm still working on how to make a proper air filtration unit that can be adapted for practically any scenario. Also, I'm working out exactly how many people this system could support. I'm all for bringing my kid and my mom but I'm on the fence about my brothers.
04/08/17, 18:45 - Infected: It probably is but I think that everyone should have an apocalypse plan. Seems like the logical thing, to me.
04/08/17, 18:47 - Tel: My apocalypse plan = be better than others at surviving. I run faster than most, so zombies shouldn't be an issue..
04/08/17, 18:48 - Infected: Also, I'd have to account for the unintended interlopers that hear of my plan and force their way through the door at the last moment. I know you can sustain 4 people on about 1,000 Sq ft of land but we'd be underground which would mean hydroponics which would mean a contained ecosystem.
04/08/17, 18:48 - Tel: If a nuke gets dropped, we'll, I'm either Gna survive or I'm not. Whether I have a bunker or not is irrelevant, this close to London I'd prob be dead  before I knew it if I was Gna die. Else I'd shut my windows, wait out the fallout, and survive
04/08/17, 18:49 - Tel: Hydroponics would just be fun to do and watch afterwards. Can imagine that being relaxing.
04/08/17, 18:49 - Infected: I have read a few good articles on surviving nuclear fallout.
04/08/17, 18:49 - Tel: Yea I've seen a couple
04/08/17, 18:50 - Infected: Fish tanks, basically.
04/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: If you can get somewhere v safe (bunker) within a minute of external exposure, do it. 
If not, stay in a house. 
If neither.. Well, just run for fun.
04/08/17, 18:50 - Tel: Fish tanks?
04/08/17, 18:52 - Infected: Contained ecosystem. You have very large fish tanks. The vegetation is planted in grids over the tanks with filtration systems in place to take the dirty water through the plants and back into the tanks. You would probably at least want another protein, though. Chickens would be relatively easy. They can eat fish guts, baked egg shells, etc. They really just need a comfortable environment. They can stink, though.
04/08/17, 18:53 - Infected: The problem is determining the size of the system. And it would need to be in place before the fall out.
04/08/17, 18:55 - Tel: Hm, you seem to have a motivation for doing it.. Something I totally don't. Means it's harder for me to engage in that I think.
04/08/17, 18:55 - Tel: Interesting to gain insight into your approach and thoughts though
04/08/17, 18:55 - Infected: You can force grow plants through the winter, especially in a contained atmosphere, however you would want to be able to produce enough food for storage in case of emergency shut down. It all comes down to the problem of determining how many people you are willing to have in your bunker. Which, is my problem.
04/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: I would say that insects are probably more sensible than chickens, etc
04/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Ad a source of protein, I ran
04/08/17, 18:56 - Infected: It's just something I think about.
04/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: Mean*
04/08/17, 18:56 - Tel: As*
04/08/17, 18:57 - Infected: Insects would probably be more feasible to maintain. I'll make a note of that.
04/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: They'd improve your plants via the soil.. Chickens might be useful in terms of nitrogen in the excrement at least, and bones etc when discarded (presuming not eaten)
04/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: But take up more slave
04/08/17, 18:58 - Tel: Space *
04/08/17, 18:59 - Infected: I was thinking that, it's why I ended up with chickens rather than gunea pigs or something. Also, chickens have multiple usage.
04/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: Electricity.. Your now generator? Solar panels / exercise bikes (or similar) that feed a battery.. Bikes have dual purpose of exercise
04/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: True re chickens. Eggs are yum
04/08/17, 19:00 - Tel: They're costly in terms of water though I think
04/08/17, 19:01 - Tel: So you'll need a good water supply
04/08/17, 19:01 - Infected: I like the idea of bikes. I was considering some type of tension driven generator along with solar panels. I have to be prepared for the eventuality that any systems on surface would become inoperable with no feasible way to repair them.
04/08/17, 19:03 - Infected: The water supply is where I'm stuck. Condensation systems probably wouldn't put out enough water for my purposes besides the surface inevitability.
04/08/17, 19:03 - Tel: Where in America are you? Diff places req diff solutions. If soil area, can you dig down? Any nearby waterways? How high above the water table are you?
04/08/17, 19:04 - Tel: If desert area.. Ya, good luck
04/08/17, 19:04 - Tel: Lol
04/08/17, 19:04 - Infected: Arkansas. Lots of clay soil but also a lot of waterways.
04/08/17, 19:04 - Infected: Southern united states.
04/08/17, 19:04 - Tel: Anything can be contaminated though. You'll have to have a good supply of radiation tablets (whatever they're called) if nuclear
04/08/17, 19:05 - Infected: Iodine tablets
04/08/17, 19:05 - Tel: Ya, that sounds familiar
04/08/17, 19:05 - Tel: A geiger counter would be useful
04/08/17, 19:05 - Tel: Southern.. Prob less snow then, else I'd say build a reservoir for it.
04/08/17, 19:06 - Tel: Prob less rain, too
04/08/17, 19:06 - Infected: I'm trying to imagine long term scenarios such as nuclear fallout but I'm also thinking of ridiculous ideas such as zombie apocalypse.
04/08/17, 19:06 - Infected: Yes to both.
04/08/17, 19:07 - Tel: Hm, dehumidifiers produce a decent amount of liquid per day
04/08/17, 19:08 - Infected: There is also a chance for dust cloud due to yellow stone erupting. I'm also thinking of a massive earthquake, which our area is overdue for.
04/08/17, 19:08 - Tel: Add in a filtration system..
04/08/17, 19:08 - Infected: Excellent idea. I'll have to add that to my research.
04/08/17, 19:09 - Tel: Dust cloud. Hm, that's v short term though
04/08/17, 19:09 - Tel: No?
04/08/17, 19:09 - Tel: Plus, you'd get warning re yellow stone no?
04/08/17, 19:09 - Tel: Earthquake is also v short term. That's more about structural integrity and immediate survivability I think
04/08/17, 19:10 - Infected: It's just one of the scenarios that is most likely prepared for along with the earthquake.
04/08/17, 19:10 - Tel: Dust cloud can last a long time, but has to be super volcano levels from the little I know
04/08/17, 19:11 - Tel: Tbh, if dust cloud, then hydroponics underground would be decent enough with a  water filtration system and a decent, reusable filtered mask
04/08/17, 19:11 - Infected: I'd like to include as many precautions as imaginable and cross reference by what precautions can be used for multiple scenarios.
04/08/17, 19:11 - Tel: Ya sound philosophy
04/08/17, 19:12 - Tel: Oh. Have you ensured WiFi?
04/08/17, 19:12 - Tel: :p
04/08/17, 19:12 - Tel: Might wanna get one of those p2p apps, if that's what they're called
04/08/17, 19:13 - Infected: I haven't figured out a way to keep WiFi if the power grids go down.
04/08/17, 19:13 - Tel: Where msgs transmit via phones without a network
04/08/17, 19:13 - Tel: So stragglers can transmit. Maybe they'll expand the range of phones some day..
04/08/17, 19:13 - Infected: An in home system wouldn't be too difficult but contact with the outside world might eventually become necessary.
04/08/17, 19:14 - Tel: Hm, there must be a way to generate a connection to the Internet yourself with an antenna or something. I know nothing, but it just makes sense..
04/08/17, 19:14 - Tel: Nonsense or sense, I don't know (but I also didn't specify)
04/08/17, 19:15 - Infected: That's one area I need to do more research on. My main focus was on sustaining environment and food source.
04/08/17, 19:15 - Tel: Lasers would be an easy primitive-modern way of communicating. They're uber powerful and cheap these days
04/08/17, 19:15 - Tel: Compost bin. Need one of those. Insects can use it to to give you good soil, and you can eat the insects
04/08/17, 19:15 - Tel: Win win win
04/08/17, 19:16 - Tel: You'll need a source of carbon to go. With your nitrogen heavy compost tho
04/08/17, 19:16 - Infected: I have compost on my list already.
04/08/17, 19:16 - Tel: Dno where you'd get a sustainable source of carbon if underground
04/08/17, 19:16 - Infected: I hadn't thought of that tbh
04/08/17, 19:17 - Tel: Carbon and nitrogen are needed for good compost
04/08/17, 19:17 - Tel: Nitrogen from food stuffs, carbon from wood /paper / dry waste, basically
04/08/17, 19:18 - Tel: Ash helps a bit I think.. But I put ash into my compost a month or so ago and the ants didn't like it. Haven't checked recently tho
04/08/17, 19:18 - Infected: I was planning to have dwarf fruit bearing trees and woody vines. I was going to add the trimmings to the compost : p
04/08/17, 19:18 - Tel: Least I think they didn't like it. It's not like I surveyed them..
04/08/17, 19:18 - Tel: Ah nice, good thinking
04/08/17, 19:19 - Tel: Need to make sure you have enough ground to avoid over farming
04/08/17, 19:19 - Tel: And you'll also need to rotate crops to make good use of the source and avoid being too aggressive
04/08/17, 19:19 - Infected: I have several books on composting and sustainable gardening but they're mostly written in layman's terms.
04/08/17, 19:19 - Tel: Not definitive gardening advice, but it's what I read
04/08/17, 19:20 - Tel: Ah cool. Good stuff
04/08/17, 19:20 - Tel: What else..
04/08/17, 19:21 - Tel: If growing fruit, you may need pollinating insects. Hm.
04/08/17, 19:21 - Infected: I have a really good book on this subject. The name of the method escapes me but I believe it originates from a professor / gardener that worked at a university in California
04/08/17, 19:21 - Tel: Oo cool
04/08/17, 19:22 - Tel: What other areas do you have probs with?
04/08/17, 19:23 - Tel: I'd recommend some decent board games. Being bored isn't fun
04/08/17, 19:23 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
04/08/17, 19:23 - Infected: Which is why I'm looking at ways to develop a self sustaining (mostly, with human intervention ) ecosystem and also fruit tree varieties that self pollinate.
04/08/17, 19:24 - Tel: Nice, clever. One step ahead you are ;)
04/08/17, 19:24 - Tel: At least one.. ;)
04/08/17, 19:24 - Infected: I'm going to have a media room lol I didn't mention it because I thought it would be obvious. Entertainment is necessary even if you are essentially waiting to die.
04/08/17, 19:25 - Tel: Haha wicked

04/08/17, 19:27 - Tel: I haven't made a move to become PM, either, but it's always a good thing to plan for it anyway I find ;)
04/08/17, 19:27 - Tel: This is why INTPs need ISTJ subordinates

04/08/17, 19:28 - Infected: I research a lot of things for no real reason other than "what if" and because I like information.
04/08/17, 19:29 - Tel: Yea, makes sense. I do something similar
04/08/17, 19:29 - Tel: Constantly scouring news sources for info. I get a bit lost after looking the 3rd or 4th time that day and finding nothing new.. Lol
04/08/17, 19:29 - Infected: I have also contemplated how to build up my own country and other ridiculous things.
04/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: Oo nice
04/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: Wouldn't say ridiculous. Just fantastical. Totally diff
04/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: I enjoy those type of day dreams
04/08/17, 19:30 - Tel: It's challenging, but somehow fulfilling
04/08/17, 19:30 - Infected: I like ridiculous. It tends to interrupt the monotony.
04/08/17, 19:31 - Tel: Well, mentally stimulating
04/08/17, 19:33 - Infected: I'm working on learning a lot of things right now. I'm reading about chess, learning sign language and building up my math skills so that I can get deeper into physics, which is a hobby of mine. I've learned enough about the philosophical way the world works. I'd like to focus more on specifics.
04/08/17, 19:35 - Infected: I'm kind of ass backwards to most people. The specific how's were kind of back burner to me until I figured out the why.

05/08/17, 00:32 - Shaiju: Ha ha .. think he is missing the point... Bad audience if that was all he intended! 😉
05/08/17, 00:33 - Janith: Want me to kick him?

05/08/17, 00:36 - Shaiju: Can give him benefit of the doubt for now... Let him explain if he can... But the post lacked logical accuracy and suggests that he may not be an INTP afterall...
05/08/17, 00:37 - Janith: My thoughts exactly
05/08/17, 02:19 - Infected: Legitimiate business people don't often use "no scam alert" in their sales pitch.
05/08/17, 02:26 - Circle: 😂
05/08/17, 02:27 - Infected: 👋🏻
05/08/17, 03:12 - Circle: Morning 👋

05/08/17, 03:14 - Infected: Fine.
05/08/17, 03:14 - Infected: How are you?
05/08/17, 03:16 - Tel: Heard of Simon Sinek? Check his Ted talk 'start with why'. I like the whole 'reason before detail' side too; Simon puts even that into a concept.
05/08/17, 03:18 - Infected: I'll look it u now.
05/08/17, 03:18 - Infected: up.
05/08/17, 03:18 - Circle: I love this idea for a bunker . In the uk therr arnt as many survivalist.  My brother absolutely adores this kind of thing has all these cool gadgets
05/08/17, 03:18 - Infected: 😑
05/08/17, 03:19 - Infected: It's fun to think about stuff.
05/08/17, 03:19 - Circle: Thats very true , have you joined tge survivalist forums?
05/08/17, 03:20 - Infected: no.
05/08/17, 03:22 - Infected: Watching it now.
05/08/17, 03:29 - Infected: Odd. I would never buy an Apple product.
05/08/17, 03:30 - Circle: I did have an iphone and still have my ipad. But its really not worth it i much prefer samsung
05/08/17, 03:30 - Tel: Indeed.
05/08/17, 03:31 - Infected: Same. I understand the point of the lecture, though. I thought it was a strange example.
05/08/17, 03:31 - Tel: It's illogical to buy inferior goods for inflated prices.
05/08/17, 03:32 - Tel: Well, not strange if you consider that it still manages to sell a feck load of products that are inferior to others
05/08/17, 03:32 - Tel: Selling an awesome product is easy.. They've managed to carve out a loyal following based on something other than logic
05/08/17, 03:33 - Tel: Ppl 'just like' apple and are therefore loyal
05/08/17, 03:34 - Circle: Haha
05/08/17, 03:34 - Infected: I understand that. I just never cared for it.
05/08/17, 03:34 - Circle: When i originally bought it i did think apples quality was second to none but didnt aprove of the inflated price for software
05/08/17, 03:37 - Infected: For me, the "why" of things don't necessarily have anything to do with what I believe.
05/08/17, 03:38 - Tel: Yea, the step forward to IPhone 4 was impressive, as was the initial iPad
05/08/17, 03:38 - Infected: This is kind of making my eyes cross, tbh. I understand it butI'm cringing a bit
05/08/17, 03:38 - Circle: Yes i bought the iphone 4 . But now apple is nothing but a shell
05/08/17, 03:38 - Tel: How dya mean?
05/08/17, 03:39 - Tel: Interesting reaction
05/08/17, 03:39 - Infected: Because I don't approach information to find something to believe in.
05/08/17, 03:40 - Tel: I think it's more a subconscious thing
05/08/17, 03:42 - Infected: I read or look or hear something and I ask myself, why is that interesting.
05/08/17, 03:43 - Infected: possibly.
05/08/17, 03:57 - Infected: Do you guy's think you're the type of person that can stand on the (ex.) beidge of the Starship Enterprise, looking at an undiscovered part of space and FEEL the enormity of what you're looking at?
05/08/17, 03:59 - Circle: I can't control my emotions tbh sometimes something small is amazing to me and other times what seems amazing to others does nothing for me LOL
05/08/17, 04:00 - Infected: Same.
05/08/17, 04:01 - Circle: But i would love to be there😃
05/08/17, 04:01 - Infected: I asked because I suddenly had that thought and my initial reaction was that I'd like to be that type of person but I'm probably not.
05/08/17, 04:01 - Infected: I agree. I'd like to experience that situation lol

05/08/17, 04:06 - Circle: Morning all
05/08/17, 04:07 - Infected: That would be great. For now, you'd have to have a Vr + Alexa + Google type of interface. Hologramesque technology for an entire room isn't feasible for a home system, atm. Not for the general populace, anyway.

05/08/17, 04:50 - Janith: That's how we learn most games 😂
05/08/17, 04:51 - Janith: Are you using free roam or piloting a ship?
05/08/17, 04:54 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 05:00 - Janith: Maybe that's how you were able to land.
05/08/17, 05:00 - Janith: I never tried landing on a star using a ship 😂
05/08/17, 05:01 - Infected: I was on free roam when I landed on the star
05/08/17, 05:02 - Infected: I'm currently randomly spinning in space lol
05/08/17, 05:02 - Janith: 😅😂 maybe I just suck at this Sim
05/08/17, 05:02 - Janith: Yeah most ships are hard to control
05/08/17, 05:02 - Janith: They also have speed limits
05/08/17, 05:03 - Janith: Fortunately there's a convenient 'warp factor' to help speed things up
05/08/17, 05:04 - Tel: Well, I definitely love being on rooftop bars looking over the city and 'feeling' it. I think it's the running loose of my imagination which is nice tbh
05/08/17, 05:04 - Infected: Well, I figured out hot to stop the ship and move it where I want it to go.
05/08/17, 05:04 - Infected: ooooo
05/08/17, 05:05 - Tel: Any good?
05/08/17, 05:05 - Infected: I'm not a city person but rooftops are nice.

05/08/17, 05:08 - Janith: In my experience, if it's made by Blizzard, it's good 😂
05/08/17, 05:08 - Janith: The main problem is that a lot of Blizzard games are addictive af
05/08/17, 05:09 - Tel: Downloading now. Presuming is a game IRL too?
05/08/17, 05:09 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Hearthstone could be addictive yes.

05/08/17, 05:26 - Circle: I wonder if they read all the messages though
05/08/17, 05:27 - Shaiju: I don't think so... Even the most active participant may not be able to manage that... :)
05/08/17, 05:27 - Shaiju: It's mostly sneak peak!
05/08/17, 05:28 - Circle: Thats true but surely they would just leave if they dont read the messagez or type
05/08/17, 05:30 - Shaiju: Logical.... after all we are introverts and like to live in our caves.. :)

05/08/17, 07:28 - Circle: Hahaha love it
05/08/17, 07:28 - Tel: Oo, actually, I think I might be writing a book analysis! It seems that it's an actual story
05/08/17, 07:29 - Tel: I wasn't very good at critical analysis back then, though.. Far too descriptive.

05/08/17, 07:45 - Didier: Everyone actually has all the functions.It just depends on which is more dominant

05/08/17, 11:35 - Circle: Id be a little scared to see what ilegal activities they are doing 🤣
05/08/17, 11:37 - Infected: Can't be much weirder than the guys that grow human ears on rats.
05/08/17, 11:37 - Infected: If they aren't working on human clones, I'll give you 5 whole dollars lol
05/08/17, 11:37 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Chickens with 6 wings
05/08/17, 11:38 - Circle: Is that illegal
05/08/17, 11:38 - Infected: Purpose?
05/08/17, 11:38 - Circle: 🤢
05/08/17, 11:38 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: More efficient food
05/08/17, 11:38 - Infected: The ear rats? I don't think so.
05/08/17, 11:39 - Circle: Although i do like hotwings
05/08/17, 11:39 - Infected: Chicken wings aren't that great, imo.
05/08/17, 11:41 - Circle: I disagree
05/08/17, 11:41 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Homogenous animals with all the best human senses... They'll find out what works and what doesn't, then develop biological/bionic prosthetics/addons to enhance human senses.

05/08/17, 11:42 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Efficiency isn't about greatness; more about getting the most bang for your buck
05/08/17, 11:42 - Infected: I like boneless chicken bc lazy.
05/08/17, 11:42 - Infected: I agree.
05/08/17, 11:43 - Infected: I'm not sure if I agree. I'll have to think about this.
05/08/17, 11:44 - Infected: It seems like efficiency should have better reasoning behind it than a good deal at the super market.
05/08/17, 11:45 - Infected: I would like to see a six winged chicken, though. Sounds interesting.
05/08/17, 11:46 - Spaceexplorer: I want a talking master splinter rat.
05/08/17, 11:47 - Circle: I have to say increasing profit margins is efficient.  For someone atleast
05/08/17, 11:48 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: I may change this statement later, but commenting on great things wasn't the main topic. For the purpose of discussing 2-winged chickens raised on poultry farms, it would be more efficient (regardless of greatness) to raise 6-wing, or even 8-wing chickens. (however many wings the bird's heart pumping could support/handle)
05/08/17, 11:48 - Infected: http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-use-stem-cells-grow-human-ear-rats-back-371176
05/08/17, 11:50 - Circle: Agreed
05/08/17, 11:50 - Circle: I wish i could unsee that . Thankyou infected
05/08/17, 11:51 - Infected: I can see the point behind your argument. I can agree on the subject of profit margins/ poultry farms. It just seems somewhat pointless to me. Not that I'm not a fan of pointless. I'm working myself around to disagreeing with my own opinion. Lol
05/08/17, 11:51 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Wow, hadn't heard that story and now I can't unsee it either xD
05/08/17, 11:51 - Infected: Not the weirdest thing I've ever read about, tbh.
05/08/17, 11:52 - Infected: Did you see the reanimated meat sack?
05/08/17, 11:53 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Uhh what do you mean by "meat sack" 🙄 I have a few things in mind... Frankenstein's reanimated meat sack?
05/08/17, 11:53 - Circle: You get double the wings on ine chicken i think thatd the point
05/08/17, 11:55 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Yeah we like thinking of pointless ideas because it would ideally be fun to see improvements on anything, not just on only improving things we see a point in
05/08/17, 11:55 - Janith: Are we talking about 4 winged chickens? 😃
05/08/17, 11:56 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: 2 * X = 6 where X= double
05/08/17, 11:56 - Infected: No, let me find the link.
05/08/17, 11:56 - Janith: Doesn't x=3?
05/08/17, 11:57 - Infected: I over generalized with the term "meat sack"
05/08/17, 11:57 - Janith: COOOOLLL
05/08/17, 11:57 - Janith: Do you have a link by any chance @15015198024
05/08/17, 11:57 - Janith: ?
05/08/17, 11:58 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: It should but maybe circle thought double had double meanings (it means double of something and 3 at the same time)
05/08/17, 11:59 - Janith: I think @447544834100 meant triple? 😅
05/08/17, 12:00 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: We could try going for 12-wings, but the small heart might not pump blood efficiently through the veins to give the hefty number of wings their tasty muscle meat
05/08/17, 12:00 - Infected: I'm looking for it.
05/08/17, 12:01 - ‪+1 (440) 391-8695‬: Two pairs of lungs and hearts needed to be grown in these bionic 12-winged chickens... Oh stem cells where are you?!
05/08/17, 12:11 - Janith: Can't we just grow wings using stem cells?
05/08/17, 12:12 - Janith: Just program the stem cells to make the wing area. We could grow them in conditions simulating embryonic fluid
05/08/17, 12:12 - Infected: Likely. Scientists are growing steaks in labs now. I found that to be interesting. I'm not sure of the method.
05/08/17, 12:12 - Infected: I'm getting aggravated because I can't find the article I'm looking for.
05/08/17, 12:13 - Circle: LOL sorry im at work multitasking very badly
05/08/17, 12:14 - Shaiju: Yeah..I have read about it. They already have produced the first lab grown meat.
05/08/17, 12:14 - Janith: The human brain is actually incapable of multitasking if both tasks are cognitively demanding
05/08/17, 12:15 - Circle: In that case i did pretty well 🤣
05/08/17, 12:29 - Infected: It wasn't an article loool

05/08/17, 12:31 - Infected: It's somewhat difficult to fully give brain function to two things at the same time. Ime, anyway.
05/08/17, 12:32 - Janith: http://www.snopes.com/the-modular-body-videos/
05/08/17, 12:32 - Circle: Yes but surely the amount of wings on that chicken shouldnt have been to hard
05/08/17, 12:33 - Infected: The video debunks the "experiment" I still found it to be interesting.
05/08/17, 12:34 - Infected: I'd like to see someone actually do it, tbh.
05/08/17, 13:57 - Tel: Dangerous?
05/08/17, 13:58 - Tel: I mean more as in lack of regulation / state ownership / responsibility, meaning a scientific 'Rupert Murdoch' type person can come into existence
05/08/17, 13:59 - Tel: Science needs freedom, sure, but not another mogul exerting control on the world
05/08/17, 14:00 - Shaiju: You guys have lot of energy.. how do you guys manage this streak? I am getting exhausted lately. I wanted to engage and discuss a lot but my cave calls me back!
05/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Maybe because something is exhausting u
05/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: Find out what is doing that
05/08/17, 14:01 - Didier: It's the same for me too
05/08/17, 14:02 - Didier: School is exhausting me
05/08/17, 14:02 - Didier: When u get rid of it,u will have energy for it
05/08/17, 14:02 - Shaiju: It's true too... It's my Fi but can't help... 😔
05/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: Fi?
05/08/17, 14:03 - Didier: Not Fe?
05/08/17, 14:04 - Shaiju: Fe...lol l can't even concentrate...
05/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: Hmm what does it do that exhaust u?
05/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: Looking for an Fi user would help
05/08/17, 14:05 - Shaiju: I think that I am trying to over compensate it by being funny..
05/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: That's why Fe complements Fi
05/08/17, 14:05 - Didier: If used correctly
05/08/17, 14:05 - Shaiju: Yeah....it might..

05/08/17, 14:06 - Tel: ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
05/08/17, 14:06 - Didier: I get along with INFJ,who has all opposite functions
05/08/17, 14:06 - Shaiju: Yeah.. that's what I do usually.
05/08/17, 14:07 - Shaiju: No known INFJ around..
05/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: I noticed that me,an INFP,who has Si as their third function can't be with people with stronger Si (1st or 3rd function).It tires me.
05/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: 2nd*
05/08/17, 14:07 - Didier: They are too caught up in their past.INFPs can be too,but we still look forward to the future
05/08/17, 14:08 - Shaiju: I know the reason but I don't know what to do about. It's like I am  feigning ignorance about my own turmoil.
05/08/17, 14:08 - Didier: Hmm how does ur Fe exhaust u though?
05/08/17, 14:09 - Didier: I can give some advice
05/08/17, 14:09 - Didier: As an Fi user

05/08/17, 14:11 - Didier: Take ur time to type since u r tired
05/08/17, 14:11 - Shaiju: That's so thoughtful..it's mostly to do with love... How do you deal with something strange like that? Like say this girl that I might have feelings is already with some one else.. it's tough..
05/08/17, 14:12 - Didier: Wait,u r male?
05/08/17, 14:12 - Shaiju: Yes..

05/08/17, 14:14 - Didier: But I can understand how u feel
05/08/17, 14:15 - Didier: Love is not strange but requires u to bear it
05/08/17, 14:15 - Didier: I know the feeling

05/08/17, 14:27 - Didier: And I understand the feeling of heartbreak
05/08/17, 14:27 - Janith: Cause nearly all my stuff is on my laptop which I didn't bring
05/08/17, 14:27 - Didier: We can always talk
05/08/17, 14:28 - Didier: Is ur phone enough?
05/08/17, 14:28 - Janith: You INFPs are amazing human beings ❤
05/08/17, 14:29 - Didier: But we always don't have the information when we need it most 😭
05/08/17, 14:29 - Janith: Technically yes but it's fucking depressing staring at this tiny little screen for the whole day 😂
05/08/17, 14:29 - Didier: We are basically misunderstood lol
05/08/17, 14:30 - Didier: Doesn't anyone else have a computer there
05/08/17, 14:30 - Janith: Maybe that's why an INFP INTP pair would work well. INTPs tend to have more info than they know what to do with 😂
05/08/17, 14:31 - Shaiju: +1
05/08/17, 14:31 - Janith: I totally forgot about that 😂
05/08/17, 14:31 - Didier: That's good
05/08/17, 14:31 - Janith: Thanks Didi! 😁
05/08/17, 14:31 - Didier: Btw Shaiju
05/08/17, 14:31 - Didier: U seem awesome too
05/08/17, 14:32 - Didier: I can see that u r feeling a bit down lately
05/08/17, 14:32 - Didier: But don't let that stop u
05/08/17, 14:32 - Didier: No problemo
05/08/17, 14:33 - Janith: @6582280971 have you considered being a psychologist?
05/08/17, 14:33 - Didier: Yes
05/08/17, 14:33 - Didier: Always wanted to be one
05/08/17, 14:33 - Janith: You seem to enjoy helping people figure out their problems
05/08/17, 14:33 - Didier: I do
05/08/17, 14:33 - Shaiju: Seriously?
05/08/17, 14:33 - Didier: I sincerely want to help them
05/08/17, 14:33 - Janith: You'd make a great counselor 😊
05/08/17, 14:33 - Didier: Of course
05/08/17, 14:34 - Didier: Haha but I want to become a psychologist,not a counselor so that I can make a great impact on people's lives
05/08/17, 14:34 - Didier: I feel that the world needs more psychologists like that
05/08/17, 14:34 - Didier: I wanna be there for them and make friends
05/08/17, 14:34 - Didier: Just that it's difficult if u r not in a job like that
05/08/17, 14:34 - Janith: Try to get into it. From what I've gathered INFPs would make great psychologists
05/08/17, 14:35 - Didier: Sadly,people often look down on us for that
05/08/17, 14:35 - Didier: They don't know until they've seen that side of ours
05/08/17, 14:35 - Janith: Sorry. I meant to say psychologist that time. Brain fart 😋
05/08/17, 14:35 - Didier: We may be introverted but we can be outgoing
05/08/17, 14:35 - Didier: Haha
05/08/17, 14:35 - Didier: But I'll try
05/08/17, 14:36 - Didier: It seems not only fun but helpful
05/08/17, 14:36 - Shaiju: Only if I was..🤔😌
05/08/17, 14:36 - Didier: It might be kinda draining listening to sad stuff all the time but
05/08/17, 14:36 - Shaiju: Ha ha
05/08/17, 14:36 - Didier: Worth the sacrifice?
05/08/17, 14:36 - Didier: Haha,don't say that because u are
05/08/17, 14:36 - Janith: In my experience, medicine is a field through can can use as many INFPs as possible
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: Really?
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: I've thought of it before
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: Any job that can help people
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: Like doctors and lawyers
05/08/17, 14:37 - Janith: The more patient oriented side of course
05/08/17, 14:37 - Janith: My mom is an INFP and a pediatrician
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: Cool
05/08/17, 14:37 - Shaiju: Yeah.. compassion is their second nature!
05/08/17, 14:37 - Didier: I nearly forgot about that
05/08/17, 14:37 - Janith: She loves her job and she's great at it
05/08/17, 14:38 - Janith: It seems like a perfect fit for her
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: Sounds great
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: Do yall have a good relationship?
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: Shaiju
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: U should look out for
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: More people like us
05/08/17, 14:38 - Didier: Make some good friends
05/08/17, 14:38 - Janith: And my brother is an INFP too and I see that he could make for a good medical professional too
05/08/17, 14:39 - Didier: Though I say this,I don't really carry it out 😅
05/08/17, 14:39 - Didier: Wow,so many INFPs in ur family!
05/08/17, 14:39 - Janith: You can be compassionate too man
05/08/17, 14:39 - Didier: Do yall fight?
05/08/17, 14:40 - Didier: Btw I'm so sorry Shaiju if I couldn't help u enough
05/08/17, 14:40 - Didier: But I'll try my best
05/08/17, 14:40 - Didier: U can always tell me anything really
05/08/17, 14:40 - Janith: I tend to lean on the more Vulcan side of INTP so they tend to find my lack of emotions strange sometimes 😂
05/08/17, 14:40 - Didier: Vulcan?
05/08/17, 14:40 - Janith: @918123428275 how long have you liked this girl?
05/08/17, 14:41 - Didier: Oh yeah
05/08/17, 14:41 - Janith: Spock? Star trek? The perfect INTP in fiction 😂
05/08/17, 14:41 - Didier: Oh 😂
05/08/17, 14:41 - Didier: So,do yall fight?
05/08/17, 14:42 - Janith: Not really. Me and my brother get along famously
05/08/17, 14:42 - Didier: Wow,sounds awesome
05/08/17, 14:42 - Janith: And I'm only at my grandparents cause my mom wanted us to go on a family trip
05/08/17, 14:42 - Didier: XD
05/08/17, 14:43 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 14:43 - Didier: Not surprised but
05/08/17, 14:43 - Janith: I don't generally like the idea of trips but I figured the gain in my mom's emotional stats would be worth it
05/08/17, 14:43 - Didier: It sucks here
05/08/17, 14:43 - Didier: What do u mean?
05/08/17, 14:44 - Didier: I'm so glad yall get along
05/08/17, 14:44 - Didier: I can never get along with my isfj sister
05/08/17, 14:44 - Janith: Cost benefit analysis 😅
05/08/17, 14:44 - Didier: However,I get along with my infp best friend,we are similar yet very different though
05/08/17, 14:45 - Janith: I usually judge my actions based on perceived gain vs loss
05/08/17, 14:45 - Didier: I get it
05/08/17, 14:45 - Didier: It's a thinking function haha
05/08/17, 14:46 - Janith: And I'm usually an emotional brick wall so I thought I'd try to spend some family time with my mom
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: I can do that but I don't carry it out in the end (inferior Te)
05/08/17, 14:46 - ‪+91 94261 53395‬: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 14:46 - Janith: Problem is I don't know what to do 😅
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: Emotional brick wall?
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: Lol
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: Just have fun together
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: Tell them u wanna have fun with them
05/08/17, 14:46 - Didier: We'll be happy
05/08/17, 14:47 - Janith: I'm not messing with you, I really don't know how to do that 😅
05/08/17, 14:47 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 14:48 - Didier: Just tell them.When u do that,u don't even have to do anything lol
05/08/17, 14:48 - Didier: Do u tell them about mbti?
05/08/17, 14:48 - Janith: Basically when I'm at home my face is either 😐 or 😴
05/08/17, 14:48 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 14:49 - Janith: Yeah they know. My mom doesn't like that I try to categorize people like that 😂
05/08/17, 14:49 - Janith: You've watched terminator 2?
05/08/17, 14:49 - Didier: Nope
05/08/17, 14:49 - Didier: Why? 😂
05/08/17, 14:50 - Janith: Dammit you young folk. I can't even make a movie reference 😂
05/08/17, 14:50 - Didier: I wish I was in a family of INFPs.It sounds like a lot of fun and more peace
05/08/17, 14:50 - Didier: 😂too bad Janith
05/08/17, 14:50 - Didier: 3 years difference
05/08/17, 14:50 - Didier: U can be my sibling
05/08/17, 14:51 - Didier: How old is ur brother?
05/08/17, 14:51 - Janith: It really is nice... Except for my father who is ISTJ 😂
05/08/17, 14:51 - Janith: 15😂
05/08/17, 14:51 - Janith: Aren't you 15 too?
05/08/17, 14:52 - Didier: ISTJ married to INFP?How is it?
05/08/17, 14:52 - Didier: How is he like
05/08/17, 14:52 - Didier: Yes 😂
05/08/17, 14:52 - Didier: I can be ur sister haha
05/08/17, 14:52 - Janith: If it wasn't for media I wouldn't know love was a part of marriage
05/08/17, 14:53 - Didier: I'm just so curious.Not just curious,I wanna know
05/08/17, 14:53 - Janith: Then it's a 5 year difference ya young hooligan! 😂
05/08/17, 14:53 - Janith: Part of me is gonna love being old and wrinkly 😂
05/08/17, 14:53 - Didier: 5!Ok fine haha
05/08/17, 14:54 - Didier: I thought it's the opposite?
05/08/17, 14:54 - Shaiju: 😳
05/08/17, 14:54 - Didier: Lol...
05/08/17, 14:54 - Didier: How old is Shaiju then?
05/08/17, 14:54 - Shaiju: Guess?
05/08/17, 14:55 - Janith: Oh no. If there's love in my parents marriage it's hidden better than the ice wall around the flat Earth
05/08/17, 14:55 - Janith: No worries man. I plan to be dead before that 😂
05/08/17, 14:55 - Janith: 15😬
05/08/17, 14:55 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 14:55 - Shaiju: Linkin park?uh?😂
05/08/17, 14:56 - Shaiju: I was not born yet..
05/08/17, 14:56 - Janith: Nah. Chester beat me to 41. I'll have to reschedule
05/08/17, 14:56 - Janith: Oh oj
05/08/17, 14:56 - Didier: So basically they don't love each other?How did they even marry then
05/08/17, 14:56 - Janith: *oj
05/08/17, 14:56 - Janith: **OK 😂
05/08/17, 14:57 - Janith: Tell me when you're born 😊
05/08/17, 14:57 - Janith: Arranged marriage
05/08/17, 14:57 - Didier: Eh
05/08/17, 14:57 - Didier: Isn't ur mom unhappy then?
05/08/17, 14:58 - Shaiju: Oh! Didier life is too different on the other side of the planet!
05/08/17, 14:58 - Didier: I can see ISTJ and INFP getting along but the question is how much
05/08/17, 14:58 - Janith: I was one unlucky proposal away from the sweet ecstacy of non-existence!
05/08/17, 14:58 - Janith: She's the kinda infp that's rarely unhappy
05/08/17, 14:58 - Janith: I considered her a role model at one point because of that
05/08/17, 14:58 - Didier: Unhappy about the marriage maybe?
05/08/17, 14:59 - Didier: Cool...
05/08/17, 14:59 - Shaiju: I haven't decided yet... :)
05/08/17, 14:59 - Didier: Janith,so many references
05/08/17, 14:59 - Didier: I like ur jokes but
05/08/17, 14:59 - Didier: I don't have enough info for references lol
05/08/17, 14:59 - Didier: So,u haven't told me about their ISTJ and INFP chemistry
05/08/17, 15:00 - Janith: My mom doesn't seen to care. Honestly my father isn't around most of the time and she has a mental case and another infp leeching off her at home plus she's doing her dream job 😂
05/08/17, 15:00 - Didier: R u 14 then Shaiju?
05/08/17, 15:00 - Janith: Oh right sorry. I forget 😅
05/08/17, 15:01 - Janith: They remind me of two close friends 😂
05/08/17, 15:01 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 15:02 - Didier: *friends*
05/08/17, 15:02 - Didier: Haha
05/08/17, 15:02 - Janith: From what I've been able to gather from the my mom she had tried to be the usual wife but my father kept being cold so she gave up
05/08/17, 15:03 - Didier: Lol I can see an infp doing that in an arranged marriage
05/08/17, 15:03 - Janith: But I understand how she isn't unhappy. She's really busy most of the time and I'm perfectly happy when I'm busy too
05/08/17, 15:03 - Didier: Ok that's good
05/08/17, 15:04 - Didier: So they aren't the usual husband and wife but
05/08/17, 15:04 - Didier: More like friends?
05/08/17, 15:04 - Janith: She's never had a vacation that's lasted over 4 days!
05/08/17, 15:04 - Janith: Discounting maternity leave I think
05/08/17, 15:04 - Didier: Btw Janith,I haven't told u  that u r funny right
05/08/17, 15:05 - Janith: Long long ago in a galaxy far far away I thought I spied a  flicker of love in their behavior but it was never seen again
05/08/17, 15:06 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 15:06 - Janith: Oh you have. Many times. But I won't ever say no to an opportunity to inflate my ego 😂
05/08/17, 15:07 - Janith: Sorta why I have a hard time with relationships myself I think but whatever 😂
05/08/17, 15:07 - Janith: I have you guys and video games!
05/08/17, 15:07 - Janith: And science!!
05/08/17, 15:07 - Didier: So how is an INFP mother with an INTP mental case and INFP son
05/08/17, 15:08 - Didier: It just sounds cool
05/08/17, 15:08 - Janith: What more could a guy want 😌
05/08/17, 15:08 - Didier: And rare
05/08/17, 15:08 - Didier: You sound like u can have a relationship when u r up for it
05/08/17, 15:09 - Didier: So don't be disheartened if u r 😉
05/08/17, 15:09 - Janith: It's so fun that I have considered capitalizing on the obvious comedy show going on in out house on multiple occasions
05/08/17, 15:10 - Janith: No promises. If I can get an implant like Tony stark I'm definitely jumping at the chance 😉
05/08/17, 15:10 - Janith: Shit... I'm doing the references again. Sorry 😅
05/08/17, 15:10 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 15:10 - Didier: It's so sad I don't ger references at times lol
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: Feels like I missed something good
05/08/17, 15:11 - Janith: On a side note.. Comedian is one of my top 3 career choices
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: Wow
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: Woohoo
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: I'll support u!
05/08/17, 15:11 - Janith: Right behind scientist and professional hitman 😂
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: U should work towards that and
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: Learn about even more types of humour
05/08/17, 15:11 - Didier: Won't go wrong I guess
05/08/17, 15:12 - Didier: *behind* 😂
05/08/17, 15:12 - Didier: Why a hitman though?I would like that too,seems so cool
05/08/17, 15:12 - Didier: I can't even choose
05/08/17, 15:12 - Janith: True.. I could write a paper, take up a contract on any competing scientists and still make it in time for open mic night at the local... Something
05/08/17, 15:12 - Didier: But so far my top is psychologist
05/08/17, 15:13 - Janith: I'm borderline sociopathic. I like killing people
05/08/17, 15:13 - Didier: Some kind of scientist or doctor
05/08/17, 15:13 - Janith: But cleanup is usually required if you want to be a serial killer and not get caught
05/08/17, 15:13 - Didier: Sounds so cool 😂 It's like superman during the day and night (if u get mt reference)
05/08/17, 15:13 - Didier: my*
05/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: If you're a hitman then the brunt of the investigation goes toward the person who hired you
05/08/17, 15:14 - Janith: Mild mannered scientist by day, cold blooded killer by night
05/08/17, 15:14 - Didier: U sure u r borderline sociopathic? U seem so awesome lol
05/08/17, 15:15 - Didier: But my favourite character might be a sociopath too
05/08/17, 15:15 - Didier: What's the difference betweena sociopath and psychopath anyway?
05/08/17, 15:15 - Janith: Awesome because I'm borderline. I don't have ASPD but I do tick a lot of boxes
05/08/17, 15:16 - Janith: Psychopaths cannot process guilt. They have a hard time learning from past mistakes
05/08/17, 15:16 - Janith: They're kinda impulsive
05/08/17, 15:16 - Janith: Most of the time psychopaths are born
05/08/17, 15:16 - Didier: Then my fav character is a sociopath
05/08/17, 15:17 - Didier: So how about sociopaths?
05/08/17, 15:17 - Janith: Sociopaths tend to be a product of upbringing more than genetics
05/08/17, 15:17 - Janith: They don't feel empathy and they're not good at forming meaningful relationships
05/08/17, 15:18 - Janith: Who is your favorite?
05/08/17, 15:18 - Janith: Sherlock?
05/08/17, 15:18 - Didier: Haven't watched Sherlock haha
05/08/17, 15:18 - Didier: Wanted to but
05/08/17, 15:18 - Didier: From an anime,he is called Makishima Shougo
05/08/17, 15:18 - Didier: The anime is Psycho-pass
05/08/17, 15:18 - Didier: Awesome anime.You might wanan check it out
05/08/17, 15:19 - Didier: wanna*
05/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: Shit. I gotta watch that
05/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: Saving your message 😊
05/08/17, 15:19 - Didier: It's talkative,no doubt an anime for intuitives 😂
05/08/17, 15:19 - Didier: 😉
05/08/17, 15:19 - Shaiju: So it's by nurture than nature!..
05/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: Well... More like lack of nurture 😂
05/08/17, 15:19 - Janith: But yeah
05/08/17, 15:20 - Janith: They're both dangerous but in different ways
05/08/17, 15:20 - Didier: An intp in a family of infps though.They must be like ?? at times
05/08/17, 15:20 - Didier: How if ur infp mom with ur infp bro tho
05/08/17, 15:20 - Janith: Psychopaths are dangerous cause they're unpredictable
05/08/17, 15:21 - Didier: is*
05/08/17, 15:21 - Janith: Sociopaths cause they're calculated
05/08/17, 15:21 - Didier: What is wrong with me and typos these days
05/08/17, 15:21 - Didier: Oh.Does that mean that
05/08/17, 15:22 - Didier: Sociopaths are careful and do plan while psychopaths don't?
05/08/17, 15:22 - Didier: From what I seen
05/08/17, 15:22 - Janith: My brother spent nearly an hour trying to figure out why I was interested in killing people in a game that actually made them feel like actual people
05/08/17, 15:22 - Didier: They take calculated risks unlike psychopath
05/08/17, 15:22 - Didier: Something like that
05/08/17, 15:23 - Janith: My mom frustrates my brother. Because my brother has a strong thinking function too and he might turn into an NT later on
05/08/17, 15:23 - Didier: Haha.I'm imaginging which of ur top three jobs are u most fit for now
05/08/17, 15:23 - Didier: Will be able to decide more in the future
05/08/17, 15:24 - Janith: Yeah. An interesting scenario would be if a sociopath could direct the killings of a psychopath
05/08/17, 15:24 - Janith: Would be an awesome cover
05/08/17, 15:24 - Didier: Meaning controlling a psychipath to kill?Good idea!
05/08/17, 15:24 - Janith: Scientist. I like experiments 🤓
05/08/17, 15:25 - Janith: Killing people is fun and all but even that can get monotonous after a while
05/08/17, 15:25 - Didier: A funny scientist 🤔
05/08/17, 15:25 - Didier: A scientist that not only creates experiments but also jokes
05/08/17, 15:25 - Janith: Whereas playing with experiments is amazing always
05/08/17, 15:25 - Didier: And uses the results from his experiemtns to kill people
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: Use his funnt charisma to deceive people
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: Haha
05/08/17, 15:26 - Janith: Richard Feynman like 😁
05/08/17, 15:26 - Janith: Except for that part 😂
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: funny*
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: Lol ok...
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: It sounds cool omg
05/08/17, 15:26 - Didier: Make this all into a book
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: Then this scientist is a sociopath
05/08/17, 15:27 - Janith: Hey Didi I gotta get to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow?
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: Controlling a psychopath to kill
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: His way of being a hitman
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: Kk!
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: Same anyway
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: See ya
05/08/17, 15:27 - Janith: Seems like a comic series more than just a book 😅
05/08/17, 15:27 - Didier: 😂
05/08/17, 15:27 - Janith: Good night 😊
05/08/17, 15:28 - Didier: If it's a book,it will become very dark
05/08/17, 15:28 - Didier: Sweet dreams
05/08/17, 15:28 - Janith: No don't worry
05/08/17, 15:28 - Janith: I'll be writing it
05/08/17, 15:28 - Didier: 🕶
05/08/17, 15:28 - Janith: I'll put flowers on the corners of the pages
05/08/17, 15:28 - Didier: While the story is dark
05/08/17, 15:28 - Didier: So evil muahahahaha
05/08/17, 15:29 - Janith: Belladonna of course 😉
05/08/17, 15:29 - Didier: 😂Nice!
05/08/17, 15:29 - Didier: Good night!
05/08/17, 15:37 - Didier: I can imagine that this would be a very cool book
05/08/17, 15:37 - Circle: I think most intps can be quite calculated especially when it comes to emotional things
05/08/17, 15:38 - Didier: Then he use his findings of being a hitman for his experiements...
05/08/17, 15:38 - Didier: For example?
05/08/17, 15:40 - Circle: Sociopathic tendencies . Or like when we dont feel the same emotions as most people so sometimes (alot of the time) i have observed peoples reactions to think so prethink how im going to react or what i should say . That kind of thing
05/08/17, 15:40 - Circle: Reactions to things*
05/08/17, 15:41 - Didier: Does that mean that other Ts may have sociopathic tendencies too?
05/08/17, 15:41 - Didier: Though Idk to what degree
05/08/17, 15:41 - Circle: I really don't know about others to be honest...
05/08/17, 15:41 - Didier: Oh I see what u mean
05/08/17, 15:42 - Circle: But i know when i waa younger id enjoy manipulating people just to see how people think .
05/08/17, 15:43 - Didier: Just to see how people think?Like?
05/08/17, 15:43 - Circle: Their reactions to certain things . Or simply to see of they will do what i want them to by planting seeds etc
05/08/17, 15:44 - Didier: Every personality type are manipulative in their own way,just that NTs tend to be more manipulative from what I've seen online
05/08/17, 15:45 - Circle: I think intps and entps are fairly good at it
05/08/17, 15:45 - Didier: Maybe intjs too
05/08/17, 15:45 - Didier: Idk about entjs
05/08/17, 15:45 - Didier: But I guess so
05/08/17, 15:46 - Circle: Yeah maybe . My brother is an infj . I think he could theoretically be manipulative but not practically
05/08/17, 15:47 - Didier: is*
05/08/17, 15:47 - Didier: Yep
05/08/17, 15:47 - Didier: I have an infj friend too
05/08/17, 15:47 - Didier: So I think u r right
05/08/17, 15:49 - Circle: i dont know why i took great pride in munipulation . I cringe now but at the time i thought i was pretry cool.
05/08/17, 15:49 - Didier: Lol...How did u thoughts about it change?
05/08/17, 15:49 - Didier: ur*
05/08/17, 15:51 - Circle: I dont really know . I think i just became more mature . I loved making people do what i want with my mind . Whereas now i believe its unethical taking advantage of people
05/08/17, 15:52 - Didier: Maybe something changed ur view a lot?
05/08/17, 15:52 - Didier: For u to know that it's unethical
05/08/17, 15:53 - Didier: Like something happened
05/08/17, 15:54 - Circle: I can only think my empathy grew over time
05/08/17, 15:55 - Didier: Yeah.I think several things contributed to that over time
05/08/17, 15:55 - Didier: It's fascinating to know how much it can change
05/08/17, 16:32 - Spaceexplorer: http://personalitygrowth.com/the-things-that-make-each-personality-type-sad-and-how-they-can-cope/
05/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: Very true
05/08/17, 16:37 - Didier: And remember when I talked about the Normal Technical stream here in Singapore?
05/08/17, 16:38 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 16:58 - Circle: That sucks but its great you guys care so much
05/08/17, 17:39 - Infected: Relatable
05/08/17, 17:44 - Infected: Being an INFP sounds nice but rather exhausting, tbh. Caring about everything all the time is mentally draining.
05/08/17, 18:24 - FABIO: as if intp dont do that....
05/08/17, 18:25 - FABIO: "INTJs may not be the most emotional people" HAHAHAHAHA
05/08/17, 18:25 - FABIO: WHAT A FUCKING LIE
05/08/17, 18:26 - Didier: Yeah.It's a blessing and a curse
05/08/17, 18:27 - Infected: INTP's can be very caring people. My intention wasn't to say they/we aren't. I think the basis of what we care about and how we care about things/ people is just different.
05/08/17, 18:28 - Infected: INTJ's are kind of explosive, imo.
05/08/17, 18:28 - Didier: ?
05/08/17, 18:28 - Didier: Yes they are
05/08/17, 18:28 - FABIO: they are one of the most emotional types
05/08/17, 18:28 - FABIO: i know
05/08/17, 18:28 - Didier: Not most but they definitely are more emotional intp
05/08/17, 18:28 - FABIO: intps are soft outside.. and hard inside... intjs are hard outside. and really soft flufly and etc.. on inside
05/08/17, 18:29 - Didier: Fi is their third function
05/08/17, 18:29 - Didier: emotional than*
05/08/17, 18:30 - Infected: I'm watching MBTI videos today. I watched an interesting one about evolving a healthier set of functions in INTP as related to how Neo escapes from the Matrix.
05/08/17, 18:30 - FABIO: did he???
05/08/17, 18:30 - FABIO: did he really escape the matrix?
05/08/17, 18:30 - FABIO: 👀

05/08/17, 18:39 - Infected: Hello
05/08/17, 18:40 - FABIO: didnt
05/08/17, 18:40 - FABIO: liked the video
05/08/17, 18:40 - FABIO: too slow
05/08/17, 18:40 - FABIO: :/
05/08/17, 18:43 - Infected: It was but I enjoyed the comparison. I liked the Matrix when I was young(er)
05/08/17, 18:44 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 18:44 - FABIO: ITS TIME.. TO STOP
05/08/17, 18:44 - FABIO: PLEASE
05/08/17, 18:44 - FABIO: STOP
05/08/17, 18:45 - FABIO: <Mídia omitida>
05/08/17, 18:45 - Infected: Oh fff- Siri is just more pleasant to listen to on a day to day basis.
05/08/17, 18:46 - FABIO: if... the things were oposite...
05/08/17, 18:46 - FABIO: and woman worked hard.. and men would stay at home daddys
05/08/17, 18:46 - FABIO: WE WOULD NEVER... burn our bras.. to the RIGTH to work
05/08/17, 18:46 - FABIO: we are not dumb at this level
05/08/17, 18:49 - Infected: I agree. I haven't met many men that would rather work if they had a significant other to support them. That may have to do with my geographical location and the particular psychology of people living in this area.
05/08/17, 18:50 - FABIO: i doubt....
05/08/17, 18:50 - FABIO: in brazil is the same
05/08/17, 18:51 - FABIO: The earliest special-purpose mechanical washing device was the washboard, invented in 1797 by Nathaniel Briggs of New Hampshire.[2][3]
05/08/17, 18:52 - FABIO: a washing machine.. is a mens invention
05/08/17, 18:52 - FABIO: i dont need... any better argument
05/08/17, 18:52 - FABIO: than that
05/08/17, 18:52 - Shaiju: Home daddy...I would have loved it except for the diapers and screaming....😂
05/08/17, 18:52 - FABIO: stay all day home.. drinking bear... watching tv... whatever
05/08/17, 18:53 - FABIO: no men.. would wish for the rigth to work
05/08/17, 18:53 - Shaiju: Ideal home...👍🏻
05/08/17, 18:53 - FABIO: beer*
05/08/17, 18:53 - Shaiju: + INTP chat shows! :D
05/08/17, 18:54 - FABIO: hhahahaha
05/08/17, 18:54 - Infected: I think we'll all be better off when our benevolent robot overlords take over and put us in "human zoo's"
05/08/17, 18:54 - FABIO: work.. is a robots job
05/08/17, 18:54 - FABIO: no men should work
05/08/17, 18:54 - FABIO: soon.. this will be true
05/08/17, 18:54 - Infected: I agree but what about cost of living?
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: i think... the creative and recreation.. will take over the world very soon.
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: 10 years ago
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: we wouldnt have a youtuber profession
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: things are changing
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: =D
05/08/17, 18:55 - FABIO: we dont need as many handy work...
05/08/17, 18:56 - FABIO: recreation and creative work.. is growing in need.
05/08/17, 18:56 - FABIO: basic income?
05/08/17, 18:56 - FABIO: dont know.... i only know the robot side..
05/08/17, 18:56 - FABIO: hahahaha
05/08/17, 18:57 - Infected: Lol its an interesting idea, anyway.
05/08/17, 18:57 - FABIO: capitalism.. is loosing its space...
05/08/17, 18:57 - FABIO: i hope
05/08/17, 18:57 - FABIO: with robots.. no point in exploring human work
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: at least we can hope for the best
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: hahahha
05/08/17, 18:58 - Infected: Even if robots did all menial labor, there would still be jobs available for humans.
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: creative ones
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: yes.
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: i think many new professions
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: will soon be
05/08/17, 18:58 - FABIO: like youtuber.
05/08/17, 18:59 - Infected: I like to call those "alternative professions"
05/08/17, 18:59 - FABIO: think of it... its been years we dont need those cashiers at markets
05/08/17, 18:59 - FABIO: at least here in brazil.. we still use them
05/08/17, 19:00 - Infected: Robots are capable right now of being cashiers, house keepers, factory workers, etc.
05/08/17, 19:00 - FABIO: farming
05/08/17, 19:00 - FABIO: tottally easy to automate farming
05/08/17, 19:01 - Infected: I mean, do we really need people to dip dildos in latex and set them to dry? No.
05/08/17, 19:01 - Infected: The technology is already out there, it's just not in large scale use.
05/08/17, 19:01 - FABIO: yes
05/08/17, 19:01 - FABIO: and dont know why
05/08/17, 19:01 - FABIO: if i made a market
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: tottally would automate it
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: everything
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: from repository... cleaning.. chashiers
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: would need something like 5 people
05/08/17, 19:02 - Infected: I think this is why we need a test society.
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: to run a big market
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: you know a job i think will be grow large...
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: coffe shopps
05/08/17, 19:02 - FABIO: =D
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: everyone i know.. love coffe shopps
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: i personally
05/08/17, 19:03 - Infected: That's already a fairly large market.
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: had one in my town.. i would spend something like 5 yours a week
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: there
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: here is not.. yet
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: i live in a small town.. form brazil
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: 80k people
05/08/17, 19:03 - FABIO: from*
05/08/17, 19:04 - Infected: I think leaving menial tasks to robots would open up the ability for people to enter into more technical and scientific fields as well as creative ones.
05/08/17, 19:04 - FABIO: yes.
05/08/17, 19:04 - FABIO: even politics can be autmated
05/08/17, 19:04 - FABIO: dont need people running a country... at least not all this
05/08/17, 19:05 - FABIO: an ia.. and a really few people.. could do it
05/08/17, 19:05 - Arne: Yeah, could. But people want to have the control. So probably will this take some more time
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: here in brazil
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: we have a really bad case of theft
05/08/17, 19:06 - Infected: I don't see why politics is such a wide spread field right now. I think that most of what they are supposed to be doing is common sense and adding the human factor into it is what causes such dissention
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: corruption
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: so some programers made a bot... to watch over politics
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: see if they spend money wrong...
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: it has no legal efect yet... but is already built
05/08/17, 19:06 - FABIO: hahahahaha
05/08/17, 19:06 - Arne: Haha
05/08/17, 19:07 - FABIO: a robot can easly administrate a country
05/08/17, 19:07 - FABIO: with human help... but still
05/08/17, 19:07 - FABIO: the bureaucracy
05/08/17, 19:07 - FABIO: is tottally not needed
05/08/17, 19:08 - FABIO: i saw one program... here in brazil.. a guy made a entyre system.. to help police investigations
05/08/17, 19:08 - FABIO: its really amazing
05/08/17, 19:09 - Infected: Do you have more information on this?
05/08/17, 19:09 - FABIO: it decryphers. scan. do all the IT job needed.. in an investigation... with multthread and compartilization... so.. lets say its sunday. and the investigation dp.. is closed
05/08/17, 19:09 - FABIO: they can leave the PCS on.. and the program will run. scaning and shit.. when they came back.. is all set
05/08/17, 19:09 - FABIO: will try to find again
05/08/17, 19:09 - FABIO: the guy posted in github
05/08/17, 19:10 - Infected: This is interesting.
05/08/17, 19:11 - FABIO: https://github.com/lfcnassif
05/08/17, 19:12 - FABIO: https://github.com/lfcnassif/sleuthkit
05/08/17, 19:12 - FABIO: this part.. ins in english
05/08/17, 19:12 - FABIO: they used it in the "lava jato" operation
05/08/17, 19:12 - FABIO: that debunked lots of politics
05/08/17, 19:12 - FABIO: =D
05/08/17, 19:13 - FABIO: it really helped speed up the investigation
05/08/17, 20:02 - FABIO: best thing in life...

05/08/17, 20:05 - FABIO: why?
05/08/17, 20:10 - FABIO: is anyone here

05/08/17, 20:13 - FABIO: not what you expected....
05/08/17, 20:15 - FABIO: you know how people say that love is overwhelming.. addictive and shit.... dont know if it is only to me.. but it is not

05/08/17, 20:17 - FABIO: no rush.. no worries. just you and the confy chair
05/08/17, 20:18 - Tahnacious: This happens to me a lot.
05/08/17, 20:20 - FABIO: but perhaps.. love deppedns more on you and the other person... mine is setled.. i have no worries.. so it fells like this
05/08/17, 20:20 - FABIO: perhaps.. with a different person.. it would be different
05/08/17, 20:20 - FABIO: i mean.. if i loved a different person
05/08/17, 21:43 - Tahnacious: Yes

06/08/17, 02:25 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 02:26 - Infected: I take sleep aids. I used to smoke weed but it is getting difficult to find a weed man. That's probably mostly bc of my personality but still.
06/08/17, 02:26 - Infected: Lul I saw that one.
06/08/17, 02:27 - Janith: 😂 btw is weed legal in your state?
06/08/17, 02:27 - Infected: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 02:28 - Janith: https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/03/global-ocean-circulation-appears-to-be-collapsing-due-to-a-warming-planet/#5f0816b0f6f4
06/08/17, 02:28 - Infected: Almost. Technically, yes. They're still working on the rules for dispensaries. We can ask our Dr's about the cards but that's about it.
06/08/17, 02:30 - Circle: Lucky you its not legal anywhere here but you can still find it anywhere.  Weed would not be my first choice if others didnt have come downs 🤣
06/08/17, 02:31 - Infected: Weed was always my first choice but then I'd make second, third, and fourth choices then I'd lose a couple of days.
06/08/17, 02:32 - Circle: Enjoyable
06/08/17, 02:32 - Janith: I guess I'm lucky. When it came to meds my first option not only helped but it's side effects provided an added benefit too 😂
06/08/17, 02:32 - Circle: And whats that?^^
06/08/17, 02:33 - Infected: Seemingly but no. I had issues. Lol Being sober is much better for my mental health but every 3 - 4 months, my enfp friend urges me into a "girls night"
06/08/17, 02:34 - Infected: Yes, explanations are needed.
06/08/17, 02:37 - Janith: What's what? 😅
06/08/17, 02:37 - Infected: Your first option. Don't play coy
06/08/17, 02:38 - Janith: I'm not. I was legitimately confused 😅
And its setraline
06/08/17, 02:40 - Infected: Zoloft, right? I know because I just googled it. Sounds good
06/08/17, 02:40 - Janith: Yeah. Really helps
06/08/17, 02:41 - Infected: 👍🏻
06/08/17, 02:41 - Infected: That's good.
06/08/17, 02:41 - Janith: The only side effect I'm experiencing is the loss of libido but that's not really a problem when you're forever alone 😎
06/08/17, 02:42 - Infected: Yeah, I think romantic awkwardness is a problem for a lot of intp's
06/08/17, 02:43 - Janith: Definitely is. We tend to try to use Ti for everything
06/08/17, 02:44 - Janith: When you're dealing with an almost exclusively emotional set of conditions like those in relationships that can lead to problems
06/08/17, 02:44 - Janith: Which is why in my experience it's always been more enjoyable dating other NTs
06/08/17, 02:45 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 02:45 - Infected: Healthy minded NT's are the best. It's more of a comfortable relationship than the up & down roller-coaster that is feeler types.
06/08/17, 02:45 - Infected: 😂 that's wrong
06/08/17, 02:46 - Janith: Exactly. Plus the frequent debates and intellectual discussions are just glorious 😍
06/08/17, 02:47 - Janith: Wrong but just so ridiculously funny 😂
06/08/17, 02:47 - Tahnacious: Kind of explains me
06/08/17, 02:48 - Janith: Honestly I'm not that interested in the romantic aspects of relationships. I just really enjoy having an intellectual companion
06/08/17, 02:48 - Infected: Ditto. I was really promiscuous for several years. When in my "right mind" I go years between sexual encounters.
06/08/17, 02:48 - Infected: Conversation is definitely one of the better aspects of companionship.
06/08/17, 02:49 - Janith: Why is that though? @61477394075 and @15015198024
06/08/17, 02:49 - Janith: I haven't been able to look into it too much so I don't know the psychological processes involved
06/08/17, 02:49 - Infected: Promiscuity is basically just having sex with almost anyone for no good reason.
06/08/17, 02:50 - Janith: No I know that. But why the correlation between abuse and promiscuity
06/08/17, 02:51 - Infected: From what I understand, it's a way to "take back control" for someone who has been abused physically/mentally.
06/08/17, 02:51 - Janith: Because from a surface perspective you'd think it would cause the opposite. That they'd be repulsed by the idea of it
06/08/17, 02:52 - Janith: Ah okay. I guess I should research the underlying structures a little more
06/08/17, 02:52 - Infected: You feel powerless in a way after something like that so you decide to take back the sexual power by engaging in risky sexual encounters. It's also a temporary bandaid to somewhat "numb" the mental anguish.
06/08/17, 02:52 - Tahnacious: I want this
06/08/17, 02:53 - Infected: Agreed.
06/08/17, 02:53 - Janith: Ah okay. That definitely makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up 😊
06/08/17, 02:54 - Janith: Why not just take dmt?
06/08/17, 02:54 - Infected: No problem. For the most part, it's something that can be overcome. It just takes a lot of processing.
06/08/17, 02:56 - Infected: I see that it's found in many plant and animal species. How is it made?
06/08/17, 02:57 - Janith: I'm not sure. Will check now
06/08/17, 03:00 - Tahnacious: I can recall a nightmare from when I was about 3
06/08/17, 03:01 - Janith: What was that nightmare?
06/08/17, 03:01 - Infected: I always find people's dreams to be very interesting.
06/08/17, 03:01 - Janith: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine

The Wikipedia page on dmt is quite interesting
06/08/17, 03:02 - Janith: Same. Wish we knew more about the process of dreaming though
06/08/17, 03:02 - Infected: I'll read it tomorrow. Thank you for the information
06/08/17, 03:02 - Janith: It's strange how crazy some dreams are
06/08/17, 03:03 - Infected: I agree.
06/08/17, 03:04 - Infected: I once had a dream about a sentient alien spacecraft that looked like a steam punk hot air balloon. It was actually really fun.
06/08/17, 03:04 - Janith: Okay now that's cool
06/08/17, 03:05 - Infected: It was. One of the rare not completely horrible dreams lol
06/08/17, 03:05 - Tahnacious: I want to do this. Can I have a bunker next door?
06/08/17, 03:06 - Janith: The closest I can come to that is a dream where I was on the moon of am unknown planet, just lying down on the barren surface and staring up at a wormhole generator 😂
06/08/17, 03:06 - Infected: absolutely. I was actually brainstorming an intp test city on my way home from the bar.
06/08/17, 03:06 - Tahnacious: My plan is to raid supermarket, head to my parents house the decide from there. Either head to Alice springs or Tasmania.
06/08/17, 03:06 - Infected: That's a fantastic dream.
06/08/17, 03:07 - Janith: I'm probably gonna die in a zombie apocalypse
06/08/17, 03:08 - Infected: I'll forget to hoard food and die trying to steal cookies from a biker gang, or something.
06/08/17, 03:08 - Janith: If there's no chance I'll be able to carry out my research in molecular biology then I don't really see much point in struggling to survive
06/08/17, 03:08 - Janith: It definitely was. I wish I had more dreams like that
06/08/17, 03:09 - Janith: Most of the time I just don't dream
06/08/17, 03:09 - Janith: I swear most INTPs are gonna die because of some really dumb reason like that
06/08/17, 03:09 - Infected: Side effect of your medication or long standing issue?
06/08/17, 03:09 - Janith: Long standing. I very rarely dream
06/08/17, 03:10 - Janith: Though I did once dream of boxing against bugs bunny in wrestle mania
06/08/17, 03:10 - Infected: It's the likeliest scenario I can come up with at the moment lol
06/08/17, 03:11 - Janith: I'm just gonna starve to death cause I forgot to eat while searching for a way to charge my laptop 😂
06/08/17, 03:11 - Infected: Childhood dream? I had a dream when I was a child that the Predator alien lived in the tree beside my families home.
06/08/17, 03:11 - Janith: 14 or 15 😅
06/08/17, 03:12 - Janith: I really like bugs okay?
06/08/17, 03:12 - Infected: A homemade solar panel large enough to run a laptop, hot plate, and fan/heater is remotely inexpensive.
06/08/17, 03:12 - Infected: Bugs or bugs bunny? Lol either way, that's pretty cool.
06/08/17, 03:13 - Janith: Sweet! Will your bunker have solar power like that too?
06/08/17, 03:13 - Janith: Bugs bunny. I am not a fan of arthropods
06/08/17, 03:13 - Janith: Not just the "gross" ones btw, I don't really like butterflies either 😂
06/08/17, 03:14 - Infected: Yes but I'm working on a second auxiliary power source as surface power will inevitably fail and I don't want to die just because I may not be able to fix some minor issue.
06/08/17, 03:14 - Infected: Bugs are amazing.
06/08/17, 03:15 - Janith: In that case can I join you in your bunker?
06/08/17, 03:15 - Infected: Sure lol
06/08/17, 03:15 - Janith: I promise to be a productive member of the group
06/08/17, 03:15 - Janith: Just the rest of the time I need to be gaming or reading 😂
06/08/17, 03:16 - Janith: I swear the first thing we need to do is download all the books in whatever servers haven't immediately died in the apocalypse
06/08/17, 03:16 - Infected: I'm going to have a media room/ library but the entire bunker should have power so feel free to bring your own equipment for personal use.
06/08/17, 03:17 - Janith: They are.. But I don't like that entire phylum for some reason 😅
06/08/17, 03:17 - Janith: We could start a new NT only colony!
06/08/17, 03:17 - Tahnacious: God there's still so much reading to do T_T
06/08/17, 03:18 - Janith: But we should keep the NFs and other types in separate areas
06/08/17, 03:18 - Infected: If I ever actually put this plan in motion, my goal is to have it fully functional before an apocalypse scenario lol
06/08/17, 03:18 - Janith: We'll need sensors to get civilization running again
06/08/17, 03:19 - Infected: Lol
06/08/17, 03:19 - Janith: Or you know.... Don't😅
06/08/17, 03:20 - Tahnacious: I have it, played for a bit, haven't had time to get back in to it
06/08/17, 03:20 - Infected: There will be separate wings but community bathrooms may be an issue for some lol its more economical but people like their own space. I'm not planning on having a huge bunker, though. I'm trying to keep it under 20.
06/08/17, 03:21 - Janith: In that case it'll be 20 NTs. The other types aren't that important anyway 😂
06/08/17, 03:22 - Infected: They aren't 100% necessary lol
06/08/17, 03:22 - Janith: I would love to make large scale bunker plans
06/08/17, 03:22 - Janith: Like in Fallout
06/08/17, 03:22 - Janith: The door to your bunker should open like the vault in Fallout o
06/08/17, 03:23 - Janith: *4
06/08/17, 03:23 - Janith: It would be epic!
06/08/17, 03:25 - Infected: I draw sketches all the time lol it's going to have multiple layers. I'm not planning on more than 3 layers. 
1. Safety zone/sterilization area
2. Living areas/ kitchen (cafeteria style) and community areas/ secondary power
3. Food and water production. I might switch it up at some point.
06/08/17, 03:25 - Janith: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 03:26 - Janith: Have you played Fallout shelter?
06/08/17, 03:26 - Infected: No
06/08/17, 03:27 - Janith: Basically a game where you do what we're talking about
06/08/17, 03:27 - Infected: My phone is dying and my feet are cold. I'll see you guys in a few hours 👋🏻
06/08/17, 03:27 - Infected: Sounds cool
06/08/17, 03:27 - Janith: Haha alright. See you later 😊
06/08/17, 03:29 - Didier: I'm sure we'll still need psychologists
06/08/17, 03:29 - Didier: So I'm good
06/08/17, 03:29 - Didier: Haha
06/08/17, 03:30 - Janith: Definitely. Odds are the demand for psychologists would rise
06/08/17, 03:31 - Janith: As more and more people fall into suicidal depression because they lost their jobs and with it what little sense of purpose they had
06/08/17, 03:33 - Didier: What happens to the Idealists? 😂
06/08/17, 03:33 - Didier: Oh yeah...
06/08/17, 03:34 - Janith: Dammit. I forgot you read past conversations 😅
06/08/17, 03:34 - Didier: 😏
06/08/17, 03:34 - Didier: Not all but yeah
06/08/17, 03:34 - Didier: 😏Come on
06/08/17, 03:35 - Didier: So what happens to us?
06/08/17, 03:35 - Didier: I think that we are needed to keep the place happy
06/08/17, 03:35 - Didier: Without any sensors,it'll work better
06/08/17, 03:38 - Didier: Btw I noticed something
06/08/17, 03:38 - Didier: Type compatibility is important in counselling too
06/08/17, 03:38 - Didier: I had a psychologist last time,just one,and it didn't help
06/08/17, 03:39 - Didier: I think he was an xSTJ (I'm very sure about the TJ)
06/08/17, 03:39 - Didier: We were just on different pages
06/08/17, 03:40 - Tahnacious: Relatable
06/08/17, 03:41 - Janith: Ssshhhh😂
06/08/17, 03:41 - Janith: And yeah definitely
06/08/17, 03:41 - Didier: Don't know whether it's I or E because it's a one on one session
06/08/17, 03:42 - Didier: Hey Janith
06/08/17, 03:42 - Didier: So what was ur plan 🌚
06/08/17, 03:42 - Janith: Do you have problems romantic relationships too?
06/08/17, 03:42 - Janith: Well.... Technically it was infected's plan 😇
06/08/17, 03:43 - Janith: Maybe we could put the NFs on ice and you guys could wake up in the future
06/08/17, 03:43 - Didier: So what happens to us?I'm still curious 😂
06/08/17, 03:43 - Didier: Wake up in the future?
06/08/17, 03:43 - Didier: 🤔🤔🤔
06/08/17, 03:43 - Janith: We'll handle the technical aspects of post apocalyptic society and ones things are relatively calm we'll wake you up
06/08/17, 03:44 - Didier: 😂 Sounds good
06/08/17, 03:44 - Didier: I'll wake up from a deep slumber
06/08/17, 03:44 - Didier: To see a futuristic worls
06/08/17, 03:44 - Didier: D
06/08/17, 03:44 - Janith: Though there's a good chance we'll all be riding velociraptors with laser eyes
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: Oo
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: Velociraptors seem scary enough
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: But that's fun for sure
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: Then what happens to the SPs?
06/08/17, 03:45 - Janith: Definitely!
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: SPs are fun-loving people with energy
06/08/17, 03:45 - Didier: I like them better than SJs
06/08/17, 03:46 - Didier: They help us to get out of our world
06/08/17, 03:46 - Janith: The ESFPs pretty useless
06/08/17, 03:46 - Didier: And just breathe fresh air
06/08/17, 03:46 - Didier: I two ESFPs.They are really nice.Just can't connect on a deeper level
06/08/17, 03:46 - Didier: They are quiet yet sociable
06/08/17, 03:46 - Janith: The ESxJs should be useful for running the more tedious aspects of society
06/08/17, 03:46 - Didier: know*
06/08/17, 03:47 - Janith: Because they don't have a deeper level 😂
06/08/17, 03:47 - Didier: They are good to have fun with all in all
06/08/17, 03:47 - Didier: Good to die together
06/08/17, 03:47 - Janith: My cousin is ESFP
06/08/17, 03:47 - Janith: I've had deeper conversations with scripted game characters
06/08/17, 03:48 - Didier: They love going out 😂
06/08/17, 03:48 - Didier: I think SPs will be used when we need to get out of our shell
06/08/17, 03:48 - Janith: We can send an ESFP outside periodically to check whether radiation levels in the environment are safe enough 😃
06/08/17, 03:49 - Didier: Lol.Isn't that...dangerous? 😂
06/08/17, 03:49 - Janith: Why would we need to do that? 😅
06/08/17, 03:49 - Janith: We can just make mech shells around ourselves and he giant robots
06/08/17, 03:49 - Janith: *be
06/08/17, 03:49 - Janith: Maybe 😇
06/08/17, 03:49 - Didier: Okay then.SPs will be a colony alone
06/08/17, 03:50 - Didier: And we can visit if we need to
06/08/17, 03:50 - Janith: Why would we tho? 😅
06/08/17, 03:50 - Didier: Sensors are good when I need someone to accompany me for a roller coaster lol
06/08/17, 03:50 - Janith: Get a couple of ENTPs and INTPs
06/08/17, 03:50 - Janith: They're better 😂
06/08/17, 03:51 - Didier: Do yall like roller coasters?
06/08/17, 03:51 - Tahnacious: To me 80k is a big city, I grew up in place with a population of 15. Not 15k, 15.
06/08/17, 03:51 - Janith: I luuuuuvv them
06/08/17, 03:51 - Janith: Whaaaaattt
06/08/17, 03:51 - Janith: How??
06/08/17, 03:52 - Didier: But I'm thinking that
06/08/17, 03:52 - Janith: Were you born in a village stricken by a plague?
06/08/17, 03:52 - Didier: Between the NTs,there can be fights
06/08/17, 03:52 - Tahnacious: I have but that is because I used an n64 emulator
06/08/17, 03:52 - Didier: xNTJs with xNTPs?
06/08/17, 03:52 - Janith: We call them debates xD
06/08/17, 03:53 - Janith: Perfect match
06/08/17, 03:53 - Didier: Idealists are fine with one another I guess
06/08/17, 03:53 - Didier: Knew it xD
06/08/17, 03:53 - Didier: But I thought with NTJs it can turn into a fight
06/08/17, 03:53 - Didier: If yall are unhappy with each other
06/08/17, 03:53 - Didier: There can be a war?
06/08/17, 03:54 - Didier: Because I'm sure they want to be the leader
06/08/17, 03:54 - Janith: Well... The debates get aggressive but it's still debating
06/08/17, 03:54 - Janith: Just that NTJs are less likely to disprove their own arguments after a while 😂
06/08/17, 03:55 - Didier: Yes that's for sure
06/08/17, 03:55 - Didier: Be prepared xNTPs.
06/08/17, 03:56 - Tahnacious: I used to be on that
06/08/17, 03:56 - Didier: But one thing I can imagine will remain is Art
06/08/17, 03:56 - Tahnacious: This
06/08/17, 03:56 - Didier: I noticed that no matter which type,they'll be someone who likes art
06/08/17, 03:57 - Didier: And since we each have our own colony,
06/08/17, 03:57 - Didier: Every year,there'll be diff types going up for the art competition between types
06/08/17, 03:57 - Didier: there'll*
06/08/17, 03:57 - Tahnacious: I was incredibly promiscuously minded growing up, just never had anyone to act it out on. Still am a little
06/08/17, 03:57 - Janith: How'd that work for you?
06/08/17, 03:57 - Tahnacious: But nothing compared to what I was
06/08/17, 03:58 - Tahnacious: Didn't, I have a gene that blocks SSRIs from working.
06/08/17, 03:58 - Circle: I can see why it helps but i never understood the recreational factor for taking it
06/08/17, 03:58 - Tahnacious: Was on it for 8 years with no effect. Took a genetic test later and found out why
06/08/17, 03:58 - Janith: Well shit. That's a shame
06/08/17, 03:59 - Didier: Wow,why 8 years though?
06/08/17, 03:59 - Didier: They didn't notice?
06/08/17, 03:59 - Janith: Are on anything now?
06/08/17, 03:59 - Didier: As u've said before,placebo effect?
06/08/17, 04:01 - Circle: I fear it because of the so called "ego death" somepeople never recover from one dose
06/08/17, 04:01 - Janith: What's that?
06/08/17, 04:01 - Didier: That is what I was going to ask
06/08/17, 04:02 - Tahnacious: I was in a park with lots of trees all in a row (I can actually place the park when I'm awake, it's one I used to go to as a toddler) and I was playing with my "best friend" who was a robotic dog, we were playing some kind of chase game bobbing and weaving through trees and then suddenly from the sky a claw domes down and grabs my friend and chucks him on a conveyer belt, which continues moving away. I call out but he seems unconscious. Then I too am picked up by a great metal claw and dropped on the conveyer belt. Ahead I see my friend being moved along towards a giant set of spiky, crunching metal teeth. My friend is grinded up in to scrap metal and I find myself moving closer and closer to the teeth, as they're over my head I woke up.
06/08/17, 04:04 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 04:04 - Circle: How amazing would that be
06/08/17, 04:04 - Janith: Now that's a crazy dream. I wonder how the brain makes stuff like that up.
06/08/17, 04:04 - Tahnacious: I very much had the opinion that I was useless, after some sexual abuse as a child I thought maybe it could be the one thing I'd be good at, maybe it would be the one thing I would be accepted for. If I make a man happy then he won't hurt me. I think maybe it is what forced me to develop my Fe so harshly. I became obsessed with pleasing others.
06/08/17, 04:04 - Didier: That is our xNxPs time to shine
06/08/17, 04:05 - Tahnacious: This too
06/08/17, 04:05 - Didier: Btw,what mbti types were the dictators?
06/08/17, 04:05 - Didier: I really wanna know
06/08/17, 04:05 - Janith: Read that book 🙌
06/08/17, 04:06 - Tahnacious: That sounds heavenly actually.
06/08/17, 04:07 - Didier: Okay haha.After my exams
06/08/17, 04:08 - Janith: Interesting. That does explain why I see your Fe way more than your Ti in the group
06/08/17, 04:09 - Janith: If enough of us gathered capital and made some investments we could probably make that a reality
06/08/17, 04:09 - Janith: Though considering our introverted nature I wonder if there's much of a point in trying it
06/08/17, 04:09 - Tahnacious: I have issues with leaving people who I have no logical reason to be with, or finding someone who feels the same way I do, or just a general obsession with being accepted as a whole
06/08/17, 04:10 - Circle: I used to . Now i always fear the worst
06/08/17, 04:10 - Tahnacious: The NF I like is 8 years older than me so I could live with him being in stasis for a few years, sure.
06/08/17, 04:11 - Janith: Same here. I guess parental interactions do have a notable effect on a child's relationships
06/08/17, 04:11 - Tahnacious: Love em. Can't get enough
06/08/17, 04:12 - Circle: Wierdly i was too but have not suffered any sexual abuse
06/08/17, 04:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah there is no love between my parents, it is more like boss and employee
06/08/17, 04:13 - Janith: In all honesty the only reason I'm not has to be the lack of opportunity in the past
06/08/17, 04:13 - Circle: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 04:14 - Janith: That's troublesome because we have no way of getting a real idea of what a romantic relationship should be. The media is unrealistic and our partners are useless in that regard
06/08/17, 04:14 - Tahnacious: I was groomed a lot and it kind of scarred me permanently. I became less scared of actual sex too. Before it got bad I was very shy and had no hope of interacting with a male, afterwards I became just blunt about I wanted. I practically went up to guys who I liked and asked them for sex.
06/08/17, 04:15 - Tahnacious: Never worked, they were weirded out 😅
06/08/17, 04:16 - Janith: All things considered that was convenient... Right? 😅
06/08/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: Exactly, which is why most people are horrified at my past relationships 🤣
06/08/17, 04:16 - Tahnacious: In hindsight I'm kind of glad they were, I wouldn't want to carry STDs from having too many partners
06/08/17, 04:16 - Circle: Agreed
06/08/17, 04:16 - Janith: What's there to be horrified about? If you don't mind me asking
06/08/17, 04:17 - Circle: Your fairly young right?
06/08/17, 04:18 - Janith: Ego death sounds pretty useless 😅
06/08/17, 04:18 - Janith: 19
06/08/17, 04:18 - Tahnacious: A lot of people could just see me being used and abused, completely loveless relationships in where I was just a sex dispenser and a cook/cleaner for no gain.
06/08/17, 04:19 - Circle: I found that too
06/08/17, 04:19 - Tahnacious: I think a lot of them assumed I wanted romance too, I didn't know what it even was.
06/08/17, 04:19 - Janith: Yikes.
06/08/17, 04:20 - Circle: You still got time then 😂
06/08/17, 04:20 - Tahnacious: I think one mans response was "I don't want a girlfriend right now" which confused me because I was thinking I don't want to be your girlfriend, I just want your cock.
06/08/17, 04:20 - Tahnacious: Yeah, it wasn't fun at all. I've been yelled at and hit in relationships too
06/08/17, 04:21 - Circle: I couldnt understand romance and always thought tv versions are fake
06/08/17, 04:21 - Tahnacious: Once to the point where I broke down crying because it was just too much stress... Normally I handle such things with a straight face.
06/08/17, 04:21 - Janith: I actually kinda doubt it. When I get to college I'm aiming straight for my degree 😁
06/08/17, 04:21 - Tahnacious: I wasn't sure if TV was an accurate portrayal and I'll assume it isn't unless I experience otherwise
06/08/17, 04:21 - Janith: I guess guys have a hard time understanding that cause of stereotypes
06/08/17, 04:22 - Tahnacious: Probably, it was frustrating...
06/08/17, 04:22 - Circle: Im glad youve broken out of it
06/08/17, 04:22 - Janith: TV always seemed fake. People had too much free time in TV and wasted it doing nothing 😂
06/08/17, 04:22 - Tahnacious: I have my virginity stolen but I didn't find anyone else willing to have sex with me till I was 18 >.<
06/08/17, 04:23 - Tahnacious: Yeah, haven't had sex in yonks 🤣
06/08/17, 04:23 - Tahnacious: I like to think I deserve better
06/08/17, 04:23 - Janith: Curious. How old are you now?
06/08/17, 04:23 - Janith: You definitely do.
06/08/17, 04:23 - Tahnacious: Hopefully one day I'll have realistic expectations based upon my virtues as a person
06/08/17, 04:23 - Tahnacious: 25
06/08/17, 04:24 - Janith: And I'm not just trying to spew motivational bullshit here
06/08/17, 04:24 - Tahnacious: That is appreciated
06/08/17, 04:24 - Circle: Quite surprising i had no problem looking back i think older guys clearly took advantage and the younger ones just wanted sex
06/08/17, 04:24 - Circle: You definatley do
06/08/17, 04:25 - Janith: How old are you now @447544834100?
06/08/17, 04:25 - Tahnacious: I didn't really leave the house much honestly. I kept talking to boys online until one decided to actually come meet me and voila
06/08/17, 04:25 - Janith: We should run a poll or something to see the age distribution in this group
06/08/17, 04:25 - Circle: 26
06/08/17, 04:26 - Janith: So we have between around 15 and 30
06/08/17, 04:26 - Didier: It does.I have read a few articles before and I myself agree with it too.That's why,parents,never destroy ur children's life
06/08/17, 04:26 - Circle: Haha i had to leave the house fot school n college
06/08/17, 04:27 - Janith: Imago Theory is one
06/08/17, 04:27 - Tahnacious: I think I'm back on track but I want to have an F partner so that the relationship is indeed a loving one so that if I have a child they won't struggle like I did in that capacity
06/08/17, 04:28 - Tahnacious: I left for school but went entire days without talking to people. Had a crush on a guy there once, got pushed to try and talk to him and he told me to fuck off because he didn't like me.
06/08/17, 04:29 - Tahnacious: I sat at the back of class then as soon as it was over I dashed for the library to hide
06/08/17, 04:29 - Circle: I think children really pick up on everything.  So when your f parter says i love you im sure they will note how you cringe
06/08/17, 04:29 - Janith: Good plan
06/08/17, 04:29 - Tahnacious: I don't really cringe when people tell me they love me
06/08/17, 04:29 - Tahnacious: I cringe when they hug me
06/08/17, 04:29 - Circle: That sucks. I was faking being an entp in those days
06/08/17, 04:30 - Tahnacious: Depending on the person >_>
06/08/17, 04:30 - Maureen: there is no love like a live for a child.
06/08/17, 04:30 - Tahnacious: Outside of school in my theatre group I faked being an entp
06/08/17, 04:30 - Tahnacious: I was all Ne
06/08/17, 04:30 - Janith: Me too. I think I have personal space issues
06/08/17, 04:30 - Circle: I cringe when im expected to have an emotional response . Especially when complimented
06/08/17, 04:31 - Tahnacious: If it is someone I love and they hug me once a day then that is acceptable
06/08/17, 04:31 - Tahnacious: More than that and I feel smothered
06/08/17, 04:31 - Janith: Ne is our savior in social situations
06/08/17, 04:31 - Didier: What r ur parents' types?
06/08/17, 04:31 - Circle: Ooo check you out theatre group
06/08/17, 04:31 - Tahnacious: Yeah I cringe when complimented sometimes like ugh now I know you are expecting me to react but I honestly feel nothing right now... Fuck... try and muster something vaguely convincing
06/08/17, 04:32 - Maureen: I love my niece to the moon and back and she feels that. she doesn't want me to leave, she wants me to go with her, she falls asleep when I'm with her (she's high need)
06/08/17, 04:32 - Tahnacious: Haha yeah, I'm actually thinking of going back there soon
06/08/17, 04:32 - Didier: F doesn't mean he'll be a good parent.I suggest u look for an NF
06/08/17, 04:33 - Tahnacious: Still trying to type them but I think my mum is an ENTJ and my dad possibly an INTP, he definitely comes off with Ti dominant and healthy Si
06/08/17, 04:33 - Circle: Thats pretty much how it goes . Also because i never believe what they say
06/08/17, 04:33 - Janith: Same. Looking back it's quite an entertaining situation 😂
06/08/17, 04:33 - Tahnacious: Yeah 😅
06/08/17, 04:33 - Tahnacious: Well yeah, I have one in mind.
06/08/17, 04:33 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 04:34 - Maureen: what helped me was a classmate telling me: "I wouldn't say it of I didn't mean it"
06/08/17, 04:34 - Janith: Well guys I'm out of candy so I no longer have a valid reason for not being productive. I'll see you later 👋
06/08/17, 04:34 - Tahnacious: Awww haha seeys
06/08/17, 04:35 - Didier: See ya Janith 👋🏻
06/08/17, 04:35 - Circle: I wouldnt believe the class mates sincerity i learned early on that people dont mean what they say . Also i know there are so so many people in the world better looking smarter better everything
06/08/17, 04:35 - Tahnacious: I can't help but think some people need to compliment others to feel like they're nice people or whatever... Like they search for something positive and just blab it
06/08/17, 04:35 - Circle: Cya
06/08/17, 04:36 - Maureen: bye 👋🏻
06/08/17, 04:36 - Didier: I know many people don't mean what they say but I mean it
06/08/17, 04:36 - Didier: When I give compliments,it must be true because I don't like lying about them
06/08/17, 04:36 - Circle: Exactly
06/08/17, 04:36 - Tahnacious: Yeah
06/08/17, 04:36 - Didier: It comes from the heart for me
06/08/17, 04:37 - Didier: What did I wanna say
06/08/17, 04:37 - Circle: Same but thats why people often think im cold
06/08/17, 04:37 - Didier: And I don't flatter people.I like to tell them the truth
06/08/17, 04:37 - Tahnacious: Yeah I'm not prone to flattery
06/08/17, 04:37 - Didier: My family who have Fe have no problem with flattery but I can't flatter people
06/08/17, 04:37 - Maureen: well that was my first response.
_compliment_
me: seriously?
_I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it_

and since this classmate was an honest one I somehow believed her
06/08/17, 04:38 - Circle: Lucky you . Im such a doubtful person anyway
06/08/17, 04:38 - Didier: For me,it's not because of that.I wanna tell them the truth,which is what they're good at
06/08/17, 04:39 - Didier: I notice the positive side of them
06/08/17, 04:39 - Didier: And I compliment to encourage them so that they can do better
06/08/17, 04:39 - Circle: You sound lovely
06/08/17, 04:40 - Didier: But yeah I see y u all are doubtful
06/08/17, 04:40 - Circle: I do occasionally use flattery fot ulterior motives
06/08/17, 04:40 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: I agree
06/08/17, 04:40 - Didier: I think that flattery is just an Fe thing
06/08/17, 04:40 - Didier: I could personally never do it
06/08/17, 04:40 - Didier: Yes!
06/08/17, 04:42 - Circle: How old r u anja
06/08/17, 04:42 - Maureen: in the school I worked the kids have a special area in their note book for appreciations and compliments. the parents have to see it because they have to sign the notebook every week and the main teacher sees it and can react proper to it
06/08/17, 04:42 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: I just saw some of the conversations now. Interesting about the sexual discussion. I was sexually abused too. I am doing research now about child trafficking for sexual exploitation.
06/08/17, 04:42 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: 30
06/08/17, 04:43 - Didier: Sign the notebook every week?
06/08/17, 04:43 - Didier: Then is it used properly?
06/08/17, 04:43 - Maureen: yes, if not the kid gets punished
06/08/17, 04:43 - Didier: Yeah,I forgot to mention that compliment is a way to show that u appreciate their points
06/08/17, 04:44 - Maureen: not hard, they won't get certain privileges or lose them
06/08/17, 04:44 - Circle: @27729498259 r u female or male
06/08/17, 04:45 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Female, from South Africa. Married to an ISFJ. 

And you?
06/08/17, 04:46 - Circle: We had something similar in our planners for detentions though ... which i signed myself of course
06/08/17, 04:46 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Is this behaviorism?
06/08/17, 04:46 - Didier: But I don't get why the parents have to see it.It's a very personal thing between the children.I understand why the teacher might have to see it just in case though.So,does it actually work?
06/08/17, 04:47 - Circle: Im 26 female. 
Always wanted to visit south africa . Infact id like to visit the whole world once in my life . But comfort means too much to me so i cant afford it
06/08/17, 04:48 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: I also want to visit the whole world! Where are you from? 

I've been to the Netherlands, Russia and Canada.
06/08/17, 04:48 - Didier: What's that about?
06/08/17, 04:49 - Maureen: it's not a private notebook. it's a notebook from school where kids write down what they did, what their weekly study goals are, what their deadlines are (because they work free of the system), what's to know about festivities or else. there is a teacher-unit where the teacher can write down a note for the parents, and this appreciation-unit
06/08/17, 04:50 - Circle: I currently reside in the uk . Ive been to france holland dubai pakistan turkey Canada america
06/08/17, 04:51 - Circle: Also visited morroco long time ago
06/08/17, 04:51 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: You should definitely visit South Africa. If you want you can ask me more about where to go, I'll recommend Cape Town. It is beautiful. Oh and Durban if you want to swim in the ocean.
06/08/17, 04:52 - Didier: I see...
06/08/17, 04:52 - Maureen: I also want to see the whole world and I've been to lots of countries in the EU.

I'm from Germany and I've been to Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, the netherlands, France, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, Spain, (and Chile)
06/08/17, 04:52 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 04:52 - Circle: I will ask you as soon as i have the money ! I also really eant to visit china singapore and barbados
06/08/17, 04:53 - Didier: It's my dream to travel around the globe too.Wow that's a lot of European countries.
06/08/17, 04:53 - Didier: Any plan for Asian countries?
06/08/17, 04:53 - Didier: Both are awesome
06/08/17, 04:53 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: To come to South Africa should be cheaper for you. Our currency weak compared to the Euro
06/08/17, 04:54 - Maureen: I can reach most countries by car. so Switzerland and france is definitely a day trip for me
06/08/17, 04:54 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: I hope to at least set my foot on each continent! So definitely I would love to visit Asia
06/08/17, 04:54 - Didier: Singaporean here 🙋🏻
06/08/17, 04:54 - Maureen: sure, I really want to see Nepal and Mongolia
06/08/17, 04:55 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 04:55 - Didier: Japan and Korea are great!U all must visit them too!
06/08/17, 04:55 - Circle: I think the flights cost  bit more though 😔
06/08/17, 04:56 - Circle: Awesome
06/08/17, 04:56 - Maureen: UK doesn't have Euro
06/08/17, 04:56 - Didier: Oh and reply to ur question @27729498259,it's not behaviourism
06/08/17, 04:57 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Yes, unfortunately 😕. 

I hope to visit Ukraine next year. My husband is originally from Ukraine
06/08/17, 04:57 - Circle: Oh yes you did say . My sister adores singapore ever since hearing her descriptions ive always wanted to see it for myself
06/08/17, 04:57 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Okay what is it?
06/08/17, 04:57 - Didier: Adore?Haha
06/08/17, 04:58 - Circle: Have you been ?
06/08/17, 04:58 - Didier: I just wanna make them feel better and more confident about themselves.It's a way to show that I care for them too
06/08/17, 04:58 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: Aaah I see. Ok
06/08/17, 04:59 - Didier: Yep.They are a must!Awesome culture...
06/08/17, 04:59 - Maureen: so my with list for my world trip (in that order):
germany
France
England
Ireland
Iceland 
Greenland
Canada
USA
Costa Rica 
Colombia
Ecuador
Chile
Easter Island or Tahiti
New Zealand 
Australia 
Papua Neuguinea 
China
Nepal
Mongolia
Russia
UAE
Kenya
Namibia
Spain
06/08/17, 04:59 - Circle: Yes shes a real feeler LOL
06/08/17, 05:00 - Tahnacious: Infps tend to be relatively optimistic from my observations
06/08/17, 05:00 - Didier: Wow u even have a list...
06/08/17, 05:00 - Didier: How about South East Asia?
06/08/17, 05:00 - Didier: No,we are very pessimistic too
06/08/17, 05:00 - Maureen: China?
06/08/17, 05:00 - Tahnacious: Possibly. I do it in excess for people I have a strong romantic connection with.
06/08/17, 05:00 - Didier: We are the most optimistic and pessimistic people.That's idealists for u
06/08/17, 05:01 - Didier: We spread positive energy because we want the world to be a better place
06/08/17, 05:01 - Didier: China is nice.Their food is delicious!
06/08/17, 05:01 - Didier: And their history too
06/08/17, 05:02 - Maureen: I want to visit a former flat mate there
06/08/17, 05:02 - Tahnacious: It is the opposite in my old school, there's a section for comments but it is only used for complaints. Parents have to see the complaint and sign off on it. Usually it's  "not paying attention in class" "didn't do homework" "failed miserably at XXX exam"
06/08/17, 05:02 - Didier: We just haven't shown u the very dark side 😉
06/08/17, 05:03 - Circle: 😂
06/08/17, 05:03 - Tahnacious: That too
06/08/17, 05:03 - Maureen: that's a reason for teachers to talk to the parents in private
06/08/17, 05:03 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 05:03 - Circle: @4915127175996 how old are you ?
06/08/17, 05:05 - Didier: And there's a reason why infps might seem positive.If we are not,we'll be pessimistic and that's miserable if the sadness if for forever.
06/08/17, 05:05 - Maureen: the punishment is getting a dash on a list. with that dash they won't get a stone and they need to collect stones for privileges.
privileges are working outside of the study room. eighter in the hallway or outside
06/08/17, 05:05 - Maureen: 24
06/08/17, 05:05 - Didier: So we r the most pessimistic people u can find.U can share both ur sadness and happiness with us.
06/08/17, 05:05 - Didier: is*
06/08/17, 05:05 - Didier: pessimistic and positive*
06/08/17, 05:06 - Tahnacious: Yeah here it was a matter of if you suck everyone knows.
06/08/17, 05:06 - Didier: We always get disappointed because of people
06/08/17, 05:06 - Didier: That's where our pessimism comes from
06/08/17, 05:06 - Didier: So u can imagine how pessimistic we can be
06/08/17, 05:07 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 05:07 - Tahnacious: I doodled all over my book
06/08/17, 05:07 - Tahnacious: Still have it
06/08/17, 05:07 - Didier: Cool...I always doodle
06/08/17, 05:07 - Tahnacious: Yeah, I just realised how INTP my writing sounds
06/08/17, 05:08 - Maureen: I still have my doodles from school
06/08/17, 05:08 - Tahnacious: This was back in 2003 lol
06/08/17, 05:08 - Tahnacious: That diary is 14 years old haha
06/08/17, 05:08 - Circle: Same i used to do it all the time

06/08/17, 05:10 - Tahnacious: Yup ^^
06/08/17, 05:10 - Circle: Yeah never dound lessons stimulating enough except for chemistry but thats because me teacher was amazing we would constantly go off topic and he would say "your going to get me in trouble one of these days . You know i have a whole class that needs attention"
06/08/17, 05:10 - Didier: Have a good day guys
06/08/17, 05:11 - Circle: Oh yes i forgot to watch the new episode
06/08/17, 05:11 - Didier: Sounds amazing!My chemistry teacher is really boring and that's how I'm failing it...
06/08/17, 05:11 - Didier: She's very loud and noisy too
06/08/17, 05:12 - Didier: Tbh,I'm not sure whether she's a thinker or feeler but,she's a sensor for sure.
06/08/17, 05:12 - Circle: Sucks
06/08/17, 05:12 - Didier: Yeah it is 😂
06/08/17, 05:12 - ‪+27 72 949 8259‬: 👋🏼 you too
06/08/17, 05:12 - Didier: My ears hurt

06/08/17, 05:12 - Didier: Bye guys
06/08/17, 05:13 - Tahnacious: My wifi is being a bitch and I'm running out of phone data
06/08/17, 05:13 - Tahnacious: Suggestions? I've tried turning it on and off again
06/08/17, 05:13 - Didier: Turn off the wifi and turn it on again
06/08/17, 05:13 - Tahnacious: I've installed a program to try and track the problem to no avail
06/08/17, 05:13 - Circle: Ring the Wi-Fi company 😂
06/08/17, 05:14 - Tahnacious: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 05:14 - Didier: Wait
06/08/17, 05:14 - Didier: I missed ur 2nd msg
06/08/17, 05:14 - Tahnacious: I think it is the second one down

06/08/17, 05:14 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 05:14 - Maureen: I still refuse to believe S is dead...
06/08/17, 05:14 - Maureen: so I have to see it
06/08/17, 05:14 - Maureen: now
06/08/17, 05:14 - Tahnacious: I refused to believe Ned Stark was dead until half way through season 2
06/08/17, 05:15 - Maureen: I don't watch got
06/08/17, 05:15 - Circle: What s died ??
06/08/17, 05:15 - Tahnacious: Takes a lot for me to accept a character is dead because Disney exists
06/08/17, 05:15 - Maureen: end of episode 8
06/08/17, 05:15 - Circle: Your missing ouy

06/08/17, 05:16 - Tahnacious: I can deliver spoilers for GOT :P
06/08/17, 05:17 - Didier: I'm not an expert at those things but maybe u can go to a friend's house and use their wifi? 😂
06/08/17, 05:17 - Circle: Oh nooo i havent watched it yet 😩 what a shame
06/08/17, 05:17 - Didier: Someone u r comfortable with
06/08/17, 05:17 - Tahnacious: That would involve leaving the house... So no 🤣
06/08/17, 05:17 - Maureen: I thought only last episode
06/08/17, 05:18 - Maureen: well last night's episode
06/08/17, 05:18 - Circle: Ive been a bit busy with work just checked my net flix it so happens that i stopped watching at episode 5
06/08/17, 05:19 - Maureen: I'm so sorry
06/08/17, 05:19 - Circle: Ive been watching suits instead i hate waitinh for episodes
06/08/17, 05:20 - Circle: Its ok il probably still watch it
06/08/17, 05:20 - Circle: Sistraa
06/08/17, 05:20 - Maureen: 😘
06/08/17, 05:21 - Circle: ☺
06/08/17, 05:21 - Maureen: technically s isn't Sarah's mom but Sarah is s's aunt
06/08/17, 05:21 - Maureen: and kira isn't s's granddaughter but cousin
06/08/17, 05:21 - Maureen: 😂😂😂
06/08/17, 05:22 - Circle: Technically its sarahs sister actually
06/08/17, 05:22 - Maureen: no because they see kendall as sister
06/08/17, 05:23 - Circle: Oh i thought kendal was the mother technically
06/08/17, 05:23 - Circle: Her dna
06/08/17, 05:23 - Maureen: she's the mother of s
06/08/17, 05:24 - Circle: Didnt they use her dna to form the clones thats why they wanted her alive
06/08/17, 05:24 - Maureen: yes and thus she's a sister
06/08/17, 05:24 - Didier: About idealists.Since we want to be in a better place,if we r not optimistic ourselves,how can this world be a nice place?
06/08/17, 05:24 - Didier: I suck at explaning but well
06/08/17, 05:24 - Maureen: not mother. siblings share more dna as parents
06/08/17, 05:24 - Circle: Ahah i see
06/08/17, 05:24 - Didier: If u search online,it will say that we r pessimists and optimists haha
06/08/17, 05:25 - Maureen: so, I'm off
06/08/17, 05:25 - Maureen: 👋🏻
06/08/17, 05:25 - Circle: Cya later
06/08/17, 05:26 - Tahnacious: Lol ok
06/08/17, 05:34 - Didier: I just noticed something about Si and pessimism.Si makes u dwell on the past.Those with a higher level of Si are more likely to be pessimistic.They think of themselves as just being realistic,but I can see through it that it's not,it's just pessimism.Often times,I'm fine with pessimism but their approach annoys me to hell.U won't understand until u mean unhealthy people with a high level of Si.
06/08/17, 05:35 - Didier: meet*
06/08/17, 05:35 - Didier: They use their Si in a wrong way and it turns into a vicious cycle.Self-sabotaging basically.
06/08/17, 05:37 - Didier: It's more likely that the feelers engage themselves in this vicious cycle though.That being said,they are more prone to it.
06/08/17, 05:38 - Didier: Those with high levels of Si are ESTJ,ISTJ,ISFJ,and ESFJ
06/08/17, 05:38 - Didier: I looked up online and even ISTJs call themselves realistic pessimists
06/08/17, 05:39 - Didier: From what I've seen,ISFJs and ESFJs are more likely to end up in undesirable outcomes than ISTJ and ESTJ
06/08/17, 05:39 - Didier: I would have to know more about the ISTJ and ESTJ to come up with even more conclusions though
06/08/17, 05:40 - Didier: Also,these types with a high level of Si,I noticed that if they have a bad past,they are likely unable to come out of their shell.Their subjective perspective doesn't help too
06/08/17, 05:45 - Didier: Especially ISFJs and ESFJs.I've looked at their cognitive functions.ISTJs will grow to be critical of people,whereas ISFJs will be wary of people.The feelers are most likely to suffer miserably,looking at their functions and the order
06/08/17, 05:46 - Didier: Don't mind me 😅 Just coming up with observations
06/08/17, 05:47 - Tahnacious: That's interesting
06/08/17, 05:47 - Tahnacious: I thought I was more realistic than pessimistic
06/08/17, 05:47 - Tahnacious: But I guess I can be both 😅
06/08/17, 05:47 - Didier: Yup u can be
06/08/17, 05:47 - Didier: They r related anyway
06/08/17, 05:48 - Tahnacious: My modem is pissing me the fuck off
06/08/17, 05:48 - Tahnacious: I blame my isp
06/08/17, 05:48 - Tahnacious: But it has been out all day
06/08/17, 05:48 - Didier: Just that people with higher levels of Si are usually more pessimistic than realistic
06/08/17, 05:48 - Tahnacious: Ahhh ok
06/08/17, 05:48 - Didier: I get the feeling 😂
06/08/17, 05:48 - Didier: Do something else?
06/08/17, 05:48 - Tahnacious: I can't watch anything
06/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: I can't do much at all without internet except chat and do household chores
06/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: But most are done
06/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: Even chatting is internet
06/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: But at least it doesn't kill my usage
06/08/17, 05:49 - Tahnacious: I only have a little over a gig left
06/08/17, 05:49 - Didier: Not even TV?
06/08/17, 05:50 - Tahnacious: Nope
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: Eh
06/08/17, 05:50 - Tahnacious: My TV doesn't have a connection
06/08/17, 05:50 - Tahnacious: Just power and ps4
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: Ps4 maybe? 😂
06/08/17, 05:50 - Tahnacious: With games that require online connection hah
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: Sometimes I notice that
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: It works better with other devices
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: Just not the phone.Weird
06/08/17, 05:50 - Didier: I don't have a PS4 though
06/08/17, 05:51 - Tahnacious: Eh, the internet light is off
06/08/17, 05:51 - Didier: Maybe this is a time for u to sleep
06/08/17, 05:51 - Didier: Or just go out and get something to eat
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: U can eat and sleep any time u want 😉
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: Its only 7pm
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: U dun necessarily have to go out tho
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: And I don't go out to get food, I only cook it myself
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: Saves $$$
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: How about cooking
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: I'm not super hungry
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: Haha
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: But I do eat sometimes out of boredom
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: Baking will take time
06/08/17, 05:52 - Tahnacious: Yup...
06/08/17, 05:52 - Didier: I know people who sleep at that time
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: I know, usually those people are me
06/08/17, 05:53 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: But I went almost a week with no sleep so I hibernated
06/08/17, 05:53 - Didier: Just think of interesting stuff before u sleep
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: Hmmm
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: Usually that doesn't help me much
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: If it is interesting I'll go on a tangent
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: Then I'll have a question in mind
06/08/17, 05:53 - Tahnacious: "I wonder if..."
06/08/17, 05:54 - Tahnacious: Then I need to Google it lol
06/08/17, 05:54 - Didier: Lol...
06/08/17, 05:54 - Didier: Kill the urge
06/08/17, 05:54 - Didier: Leave it for the next day
06/08/17, 05:54 - Tahnacious: I stay up all night just because I try to sleep then think of something and ocd have to know
06/08/17, 05:54 - Didier: I notice it helps me to sleep if I close my eyes and never open it
06/08/17, 05:54 - Didier: If I do open it,then shit
06/08/17, 05:54 - Tahnacious: 🤣 yeah I am often in the "shit" phase
06/08/17, 05:55 - Didier: U have OCD?
06/08/17, 05:55 - Tahnacious: No but it feels like it
06/08/17, 05:55 - Didier: Oh
06/08/17, 05:55 - Tahnacious: When it comes to knowing things
06/08/17, 05:55 - Tahnacious: If I have a burning question in my mind I have to Google it
06/08/17, 05:55 - Tahnacious: No ifs ands or buts
06/08/17, 05:55 - Didier: I get the feeling
06/08/17, 05:56 - Didier: Are u able to leave it to the next day?
06/08/17, 05:56 - Didier: Just force urself to remember
06/08/17, 05:56 - Tahnacious: I've tried dropping the Google but then I just stay up 3 hours wondering
06/08/17, 05:56 - Tahnacious: And it would've taken me less time to just Google it
06/08/17, 05:56 - Tahnacious: 😂 I'm terrible
06/08/17, 05:56 - Didier: DON'T OPEN UR EYES EVER
06/08/17, 05:56 - Didier: Haha
06/08/17, 05:56 - Tahnacious: I've always had sleep issues
06/08/17, 05:56 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 05:57 - Didier: Same...But recently,it's not as bad
06/08/17, 05:57 - Didier: Because I'll think of
06/08/17, 05:57 - Didier: Interesting situations
06/08/17, 05:57 - Didier: Instead of thinking of questions
06/08/17, 05:57 - Tahnacious: I think if I tried to I might be able to sleep. I still feel tired even though I managed 7 hours last night
06/08/17, 05:57 - Tahnacious: Yeah
06/08/17, 05:58 - Didier: The same thing happened to me too
06/08/17, 05:58 - Tahnacious: If I think of stuff that j wish would happen
06/08/17, 05:58 - Tahnacious: Like what would I do if...
06/08/17, 05:58 - Tahnacious: Then focus on possibilities
06/08/17, 05:58 - Tahnacious: Then I usually sleep easier
06/08/17, 05:58 - Didier: Because I have sleeping problems,
06/08/17, 05:59 - Didier: I have found two ways to sleep including  this and
06/08/17, 05:59 - Tahnacious: But if I spend my time going shit I hope that package didn't get misdelivered... Maybe I should check the tracking number... Oh crap what about that bill, did I pay it?
06/08/17, 05:59 - Didier: This is indiscreet but fapping really helps me to sleep 😂
06/08/17, 06:00 - Tahnacious: "I guess I have to hang around with my friend tomorrow, ugh this sucks... What will she get me to do this time? Is there a way to avoid it? Maybe I should Google ways to ditch friends..."
06/08/17, 06:00 - Tahnacious: Lol!
06/08/17, 06:00 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 06:00 - Tahnacious: I hear it is less helpful for girls
06/08/17, 06:00 - Tahnacious: Generally
06/08/17, 06:00 - Didier: Really?
06/08/17, 06:00 - Didier: It is very helpful for me
06/08/17, 06:00 - Tahnacious: All I know is good sex wipes me out
06/08/17, 06:01 - Didier: It makes me sleepy
06/08/17, 06:01 - Tahnacious: But fapping usually doesn't, I hardly get any satisfaction out of it
06/08/17, 06:01 - Didier: Doing it wrong? 😂
06/08/17, 06:01 - Tahnacious: Usually because I tense up before I climax
06/08/17, 06:01 - Tahnacious: >_<
06/08/17, 06:02 - Tahnacious: I can't fap properly because just as things are about to happen my hand involuntarily stops moving
06/08/17, 06:02 - Didier: Hmm
06/08/17, 06:02 - Tahnacious: Usually results in like a lame twitch that feels a bit like an orgasm but not fulfilling
06/08/17, 06:02 - Didier: Maybe use a sex toy instead 😂 though I've never tried
06/08/17, 06:02 - Tahnacious: Like enough to make your body think you have but without the enjoyment
06/08/17, 06:02 - Tahnacious: XD
06/08/17, 06:02 - Tahnacious: So bad...
06/08/17, 06:03 - Tahnacious: Yeah I've tried those. Only my auto thrusting one worked for me and it broke.
06/08/17, 06:03 - Didier: Lol...U have to get a new one now!
06/08/17, 06:03 - Tahnacious: Gets me there faster than my hand though
06/08/17, 06:03 - ‪+61 413 441 621‬: Alrighty, I think that's enough for me
06/08/17, 06:03 - Tahnacious: But they're over $200 :(
06/08/17, 06:03 - Tahnacious: Lmao
06/08/17, 06:03 - Tahnacious: Sorry
06/08/17, 06:04 - Didier: 😂😂
06/08/17, 06:04 - Didier: Wow...Find a cheaper alternative
06/08/17, 06:04 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 06:04 - Tahnacious: Maybe a male prostitute for a night? Haha
06/08/17, 06:05 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 06:05 - Didier: Have u tried?
06/08/17, 06:05 - ‪+61 413 441 621‬ saiu
06/08/17, 06:05 - Tahnacious: Any time I need to sleep just hire one to come over
06/08/17, 06:05 - Tahnacious: Lol nope >_>
06/08/17, 06:05 - Didier: Lol...
06/08/17, 06:05 - Didier: That's what I wanted to say
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: Hmm
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: Would be funny
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: Yeah xD
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: But not financially practical either
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: 7 nights a week xD
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: An alternative is
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: A "boyfriend"
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: Haha
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: Well yeah
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: Working on that front
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: But those are expensive too
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: You have to feed them and stuff
06/08/17, 06:06 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 06:06 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 06:07 - Didier: Sounds cute
06/08/17, 06:07 - Didier: It's good that u can cook too
06/08/17, 06:07 - Tahnacious: It can be
06/08/17, 06:07 - Tahnacious: Yeah, moving out of home young kind of forced my hand
06/08/17, 06:07 - Didier: I know u've had bad experiences but don't let that stop u
06/08/17, 06:07 - Tahnacious: Neither of my parents cook
06/08/17, 06:07 - Didier: No wonder
06/08/17, 06:07 - Tahnacious: Mum doesn't use the kitchen at all, and dad microwaves things
06/08/17, 06:08 - Didier: I really wanna move out young but
06/08/17, 06:08 - Didier: I don't think I will be able to survive
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: When I was your age I wanted to be adopted
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: Foster parents
06/08/17, 06:08 - Didier: Wow isn't that bad for health
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: Probably lol
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: We lived off steamed veggies in a microwave container
06/08/17, 06:08 - Tahnacious: 2 min noodles
06/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: Stuff like that
06/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: Sammiches
06/08/17, 06:09 - Didier: I've thought of being adopted but
06/08/17, 06:09 - Didier: I was like,"how does that work?"
06/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: I just wanted to be anywhere with anyone except my parents
06/08/17, 06:09 - Tahnacious: Even African starvation camp was starting to sound interesting
06/08/17, 06:09 - Didier: Same...
06/08/17, 06:10 - Didier: But woah,that kind of life
06/08/17, 06:10 - Tahnacious: Yup, it sucks
06/08/17, 06:10 - Didier: Bye,I gotta make lunch  😂

06/08/17, 06:11 - Tahnacious: Ok lol
06/08/17, 06:11 - Tahnacious: I just ate some peas because whatever, too much effort lol
06/08/17, 06:12 - Didier: U should have something stored up in the house like fries and cheese
06/08/17, 06:12 - Didier: U know air fryers?
06/08/17, 06:12 - Didier: They make life so easy
06/08/17, 06:12 - Didier: Everyone needs one
06/08/17, 06:12 - Tahnacious: Yeah I wanna have one
06/08/17, 06:12 - Tahnacious: $$$
06/08/17, 06:12 - Didier: All mt friends have them too
06/08/17, 06:13 - Didier: It's really convenient!
06/08/17, 06:13 - Didier: It's something that my family doesn't regret buying
06/08/17, 06:13 - Didier: U need one!! Haha
06/08/17, 06:13 - Didier: Totally worth it
06/08/17, 06:13 - Didier: Ok this sounds like advertising but
06/08/17, 06:13 - Tahnacious: XD
06/08/17, 06:13 - Tahnacious: I'll look in to it
06/08/17, 06:14 - Didier: I'll take picture
06/08/17, 06:14 - Didier: Wait a minutr
06/08/17, 06:14 - Didier: The air fryer is best for a lazy ass like me
06/08/17, 06:15 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 06:15 - Tahnacious: Probably healthier than pan frying anyway
06/08/17, 06:15 - Didier: It is
06/08/17, 06:15 - Didier: No need to use oil too
06/08/17, 06:16 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 06:18 - Tahnacious: Sounds good. Maybe I'll ask for one for Christmas
06/08/17, 06:23 - Didier: Was talking to my grandma.Feeling nostalgic...Wasn't able to talk to her for quite long
06/08/17, 06:23 - Didier: U totally should
06/08/17, 06:35 - Didier: This meaning Si types are more prone to depression.Any type can have depression.It's just about how likely.
06/08/17, 06:38 - Didier: I just found out that Hillary Clinton is an ISTJ haha
06/08/17, 06:40 - Tel: LOL
06/08/17, 06:41 - Didier: http://personalityjunkie.com/09/introverted-sensing-sensation-si/

Good article I found
06/08/17, 06:43 - Didier: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 06:43 - Didier: That's why Si can be put to good or bad use ,telling us what is good or bad from past experiences
06/08/17, 06:44 - Didier: Like INJs, SJs often experience a strong sense of conviction, a gut feeling about whether some is true or false, right or wrong. This, without having really done much as far as conscious reasoning to arrive at such conclusions. So while Si types may seem stubborn or closed-minded, they may feel that they have little as far as free choice in what they believe. This is why Jung considered Si anirrational function. Not because its conclusions are necessarily irrational, but because of the unconscious way it receives information and draws conclusions.
06/08/17, 06:44 - Didier: Good explanation
06/08/17, 06:45 - Didier: They r talking about INJs' Ni and SJs' Si
06/08/17, 06:47 - Tahnacious: Yeah that makes sense
06/08/17, 06:47 - Didier: An excellent example of the irrational element of Introverted Sensing can be found in the book, The Woman Who Can’t Forget. There, the author explains her uncanny ability to accurately recall the details of each and every day of her life, including related historical dates and events. While her powers of memory are undoubtedly unprecedented, what is most telling with regard to her Si is that fact that she cannot control it. She reports feeling great frustration because her mind is constantly replaying memories in a random fashion, despite her best efforts to eliminate them and focus on the present. Even if extraordinary, her experience speaks to the passive, involuntaryway in which Si in records and recollects information. This helps to explain why Si dominant types seem to effortlessly recall all sorts of random details and facts. Their recall is simply too quick to be attributed to conscious effort.  Such displays of effortless and accurate memory why many non-Si types may see ISJs as unusually intelligent.

Finally, while Ni and Si are both irrational functions, Si is less synthetic and creative than Ni.Si more or less preserves and relays information in its original form. Ni acts more synthetically, weaving together disparate information to construct novel theories, visions, and insights
06/08/17, 06:47 - Didier: Tells us a lot about Si
06/08/17, 06:47 - Didier: How it affects us too
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tel: <Mídia omitida>
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tel: Sorry, hit button by accident
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tahnacious: ?
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tahnacious: Lol
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tel: Damn, lost my place now. Need to scroll :.
06/08/17, 06:50 - Tel: :/*
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tahnacious: I hate that, been doing it all day
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tel: Hi @61477394075 :)
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tahnacious: Hey :) I finally caught up
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tel: Haha. Yea. 1300 msgs when I came back on
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tahnacious: Took me hours
06/08/17, 06:51 - Tahnacious: My life has just been out of order lately
06/08/17, 06:54 - Didier: Ever heard of the line "You learn from experience"? This best describes Si.However it can be misused,because our new experiences,what we r going to experience,might not be the same as our old experiences.Therefore,people with Si can be seen as stubborn.
06/08/17, 06:54 - Didier: Holy shit
06/08/17, 06:55 - Didier: Now I know why my sister is stubborn
06/08/17, 06:55 - Didier: 😂
06/08/17, 06:55 - Tel: There's evidence for this actually.. Some documentary showing the brain's constitution and how certain elements in a psychopath's brain are less developed than in other people's. Quite a few ppl in society, actually.. If they have a traumatic childhood, then it can turn them into bad ppl, basically. I'll see if I can find the documentary I saw before
06/08/17, 06:55 - Tel: Aw, how come.
06/08/17, 06:55 - Tel: ? *
06/08/17, 06:56 - Tel: Elaborate?
06/08/17, 06:56 - Didier: Love documentaries.They say that psychopaths are born while sociopaths are made.I'm not surprised actually.The question is how
06/08/17, 06:57 - Didier: Later 😂
06/08/17, 06:57 - Tel: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2242349/

It's not the documentary, but it's likely an even more trusted source
06/08/17, 06:58 - Didier: Because of Si,they will stick to their old ways,what worked for them,which makes them seem stubbron
06/08/17, 06:58 - Didier: stubborn
06/08/17, 06:59 - Didier: I left an ice cream to melt and it's foam and water
06/08/17, 06:59 - Didier: I've seen the article saying that someone is surprised by it but
06/08/17, 06:59 - Didier: Not surprised.All the chemicals...
06/08/17, 06:59 - Tel: Not sociopathic I think, just how we process things. There will likely be emotions there, you're just ignoring them in favour of logic.. Perhaps your emotions are actually even driving you to respond logically in order to 'fit in'
06/08/17, 07:00 - Didier: I think u r right.
06/08/17, 07:00 - Tel: Yea, crap ice-cream basically. If I buy it, I try to get decent stuff without emulsifiers or whatever.. Horrid crap
06/08/17, 07:01 - Tel: Ah k, makes sense.
06/08/17, 07:01 - Tel: Ty
06/08/17, 07:01 - Tel: :)
06/08/17, 07:01 - Didier: Yeah
06/08/17, 07:01 - Didier: Even expensive ice cream I thino
06/08/17, 07:01 - Didier: think
06/08/17, 07:03 - Didier: Haha byee
06/08/17, 07:04 - Didier: I think that our Si can be seen in how we choose food too
06/08/17, 07:04 - Didier: I will always go to the same stores even if I buy different food
06/08/17, 07:04 - Didier: I switch from something to something.I try to eat different food but I always end up with the same food sometimes
06/08/17, 07:07 - Tel: You would if you were treated as second class citizens without influence on how the country is run etc.. Also, women were (are) treated poorly even today, ie expected to out food on the table even after they work. Kinda terrible
06/08/17, 07:08 - Didier: I think that what I've said is the work of Ne and Si
06/08/17, 07:08 - Didier: The ice cream made me think about those "minds"  behind it
06/08/17, 07:08 - Didier: Thinking about effective ways to earn profit,make business
06/08/17, 07:08 - Didier: Which lead to a terribly unhealthy world we live in today
06/08/17, 07:09 - Didier: Yes,it is terrible
06/08/17, 07:11 - Didier: I don't really know which types are like that but well
06/08/17, 08:50 - Circle: I see what your saying and i agree.  I can only speak for my self as i haven't done any research on this subject but i do know there have been more than a few instances where i have felt no remorse manipulating people
